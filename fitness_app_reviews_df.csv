0,com.nike.plusgps,"The audio guides themselves are generally good, but everything else about this app is bad. EVERYTHING. It crashes, it logs me out frequently, runs won't end, you can't search runs and it's constantly un-dowloading the ones I had saved so I have to find them again. It looks nice but they forgot to make a functional product, which kind of summarizes Nike as a company. EDIT: They updated the app and it's WORSE. I think I'm going to uninstall it at this point.",1
1,com.nike.plusgps,"I have a Google pixel 8 pro. This app is absolutely horrible on an android. I started the 5k training plan & it often gets stuck on the rest interval of a run and no matter how much pausing and resuming I do, it doesn't go onto the next interval so most of the time I'm doing a run with this app, I'm almost halfway into a run and I can't continue my training because the app gets stuck and glitches. I also can't connect to my Spotify with my Google pixel so I have to open Spotify in the background",1
2,com.nike.plusgps,"This is the most buggy, slow, incredibly frustrating apps I've probably ever used. It takes upwards of 20 minutes to ""complete my run"". It logs me out all the time. The UI is not very user friendly I don't think. I feel like this app should be miles and miles better than what it is but it falls very short of that. I am on an android device so that might be my problem but why on earth should that mess with it? I hope it gets better soon or I'm looking elsewhere.",1
3,com.nike.plusgps,"This used to be my go-to running app, but in the last year, it's gotten worse and worse. Every time you log out, which happens any time the app updates, you lose ALL of your saved runs. Music volume used to be temporarily lowered when a coach was talking. This is no longer the case. You hear both your music and the coach at full volume. Pausing the run often breaks coach prompt timing. Entire sections are sometimes skipped. I don't think anyone at Nike uses this app on Android... Avoid.",1
4,com.nike.plusgps,This app used to be really good. Now it just sucks. Especially the downloadable runs. They are no longer compatible with music (they don't lower the volume so you can hear the coach) and they break any time you have to pause and quickly switch to another app. I was just doing a speed run when I got a text I needed to respond to. I paused the workout and switched to messenger. Then when I switched back the workout was no longer tracking distance and the intervals were no longer auto-pausing.,1
5,com.nike.plusgps,"Just plagued with issues. Notably, the guided runs would often lose count during an interval. For instance, during a 30 second interval, the voiceover would often disappear beyond 30 seconds then miraculously return about a minute later. This has been ongoing for the last few weeks with no fix in sight, please just get the basics right.",1
6,com.nike.plusgps,"This doesn't work on Android. The info in the guided runs is excellent, but the audio doesn't play back correctly. You might be doing a speed run that tells you to run hard for 2 minutes, and the next audio track might play one minute in saying ""hope you feel rested, because our 4th interval for 5 minutes at 5k pace starts in 3... 2... "" and you feel at that point you are wasting your time. And even without the guided runs, the app sometimes locks up while tracking a regular run.",1
7,com.nike.plusgps,"This app USED to be good. Now it can't seem to handle playing music and guidance simultaneously - one always drowns out the other. It also lost half my progress on my most recent run, saying I ran .88 miles instead of the 1.68 logged on my watch. I've submitted feedback multiple times from the app with no response and no sign of receipt or action as a result of this feedback. I wish this went back to an earlier version over a year ago that had no bugs. It's really a shame.",1
8,com.nike.plusgps,"Absolutely riddled with glitches that would be embarrassing from a C list app, let alone Nike. Logs me out after every use. Guided runs are never synchronized to the time of the run due to buffering (says you have seven minutes to go three minutes from end of run, etc√©tera). Does not work with Spotify at all despite claiming cross compatibility. Fixes don't work, apps pause each other. When it works it's great. Good luck making that happen.",1
9,com.nike.plusgps,"The GPS on Android OS is off. It signs you off frequently and sign back in is painful! The results are not consistent compared to Garmin GPS (the longer is run, the larger the error). Recently, I did a 10 miler, this App said it is 13 miles. The timing on speed runs are also off. 10 sec on watch is announced as 30 sec on the guided run!. Need a major fix. The only good thing is guided runs and can be good App for beginners.",1
10,com.nike.plusgps,11/23 update: havent had to force stop in a while but it randomly pauses without actually pausing so you end up running way longer than you are supposed to or just have to stop on your own cause it isnt tracking you anymore. Having to force stop the app to end a run like many others have said. On a samsung galaxy. It would be a great app otherwise.,1
11,com.nike.plusgps,"Downgraded from 5 to 1 because it's been completely unreliable and an hindrance to my runs. Timing, audio, all messed up. A ""guided"" run will tell you you got 60 seconds to run, and after 60 seconds, you got 90 seconds left? Either this app helps you time travel, in which case I give it 5/5, or they messed it up after the last update, which then justifies my 1/5.",1
12,com.nike.plusgps,"Loved the app before the most recent update. I used Guided Runs on basically every run. Now, there's an issue with the audio where you either can't hear the coach, or the music volume won't go back up when they aren't talking. Emailed support, they say there won't be a fix anytime soon. Won't use the app until it's fixed, which sounds like might be never.",1
13,com.nike.plusgps,"Update: downgraded to one star because it's completely unreliable. You'll do an interval run and it'll casually won't tell you when to start or stop. And yes this was a ""guided run"". Incredibly frustrating when you're trying to achieve a goal. Do not use as a run coach. Good, when it works. Incredibly frustrating to log an entire run then the app freezes. Or doing interval runs and it just stops prompting you to start/stop an interval.",1
14,com.nike.plusgps,"I loved the app when it worked. Although for several weeks, the audio part has been messed up. When I start an audio guided run with my own music playing, the app doesn't lower my music when the coach is talking. They are just both blaring at the same time. If I press pause, then play, my music lowers, and I can hear the coach, but when the coach goes quiet for a bit, my music remains low. It doesn't turn back up. I've called the support many times about it, and no one reached out.",1
15,com.nike.plusgps,"The guided runs and the training plans are great! Unfortunately in recent months, the app has had problems transitioning between pauses and ending runs, having to force stop the app through the phone settings in order to end the run. This is such a frustrating experience and also totally messes up the recorded paces and distances. Hoping that this fundamental feature will get fixed soon. This app would be so much better if they reverted all their changes from the past year and a half.",1
16,com.nike.plusgps,"Used to work great. Now, when I have any run with intervals the timing is off and I don't get a verbal notice to move into the next run or rest period. For example, a sprint of 20 sec and rest for 10 sec repeating only announces the sprint with no countdown for the rest and on the last sprint interval there was no countdown out or announcement of the 3 minute cool down",1
17,com.nike.plusgps,This would be bad for a free app. It's embarrassing for a paid app from a company as big as Nike. You have to log into the app almost every time you open it and 25% of the time it freezes on the log in page and you have to start over. I've searched for fixes and this issue has been going on for years. When you re-log in you also have to reset all of your settings. The training plans are okay but some of the runs are guided with no way to turn off the coach.,1
18,com.nike.plusgps,"Downgraded from 5 to 1 star for all the reasons listed in previous reviews.... This has so much potential, but it's the buggiest app I've ever experienced. The interval runs always screw up and it's even cut a long run off early. So frustrating, as they should be simple fixes, but it's completely messing up my training.",1
19,com.nike.plusgps,Completely inaccurate when tracking runs. I will run the exact same route along a running path that runs directly parallel to a major road in my city and the mileage will differ by as much as half a mile from day to day. It also constantly logs me out and resets my settings. Its really only useful for tracking how many miles you've run in a month etc but again it is not accurate.,1
20,com.nike.plusgps,"Not sure what is going on with the app, I've had this app for over 5+ years and never was frustrated as I am now! Everytime I do an interval run the audio does not match with the intervals. Now, it's not even saving my runs so I just completed a run for my training plan and it didn't mark it as complete.",1
21,com.nike.plusgps,"Would be a good app except the location turns off when I lock my screen. I looked for location permissions and it's set to when app is in use, I did a quick Google search and found that I cannot allow Nike location permissions all the time because Google makes devs jump through too many hoops to get that permission as an option. Please fix! I had to scrap my first run, which was upposed to be my baseline but because it skipped 50% of my run idk how far I went or my actual pace. Very upset.",1
22,com.nike.plusgps,Used this app to train for a marathon. It's distance and pace tracking is way off. It will tell me I've run 20 miles when I've only run not much more than 12 and that my average pace was much quicker than it actually was. Unfortunately this wasn't apparent until the actual date of the race. I'll be using a more accurate tracker for future training.,1
23,com.nike.plusgps,"What happened? This app used to be great. I've been using it for about 15 years. Then a couple of years ago I had to start logging in every single time I opened the app - which was annoying and a time suck. Now over the last few weeks I can't even get into the app at all. It says I've logged in successfully, then it takes me back to the app start up screen again!",1
24,com.nike.plusgps,"****Lots of serious bugs, no in-app bug reporting.**** - Guided runs often end early and prompts come in at the wrong time - Training runs get saved as regular runs so I get no data about segment times - Music doesn't duck for first audio prompt, stays too soft until end of run - Automatic audio feedback comes in on guided runs (which shouldn't happen) - App doesn't open correctly always - A lot of the weekly summary audios are in Spanish",1
25,com.nike.plusgps,"Like many other recent reviews mention, this app has become almost unusable. Coach Bennett is a national treasure but he is the only bright spot. The app isn't compatible with ANY music service, even Spotify which is supposed to have compatibility. All of your podcasts and audio books will have to be manually stopped & started again as the mileage/time updates come through. All of my speed run interval progress is lost at the end of each run. It's just a mess.",1
26,com.nike.plusgps,"The app has too many bugs now which make it useless. It no longer lowers the music volume when the coaches are talking, and it doesn't pause podcasts either. But worst of all is that the coach's prompts are completely out of sync with the timer which makes it impossible to follow the training plan. I'm not sure if this is caused by pausing the workout as others have mentioned, but it shouldn't be!! Really disappointed",1
27,com.nike.plusgps,"The app only works sometimes . I only use it to compete with my friends, but compared to the Adidas app ,this one pales in comparison. There's no way to challenge previous runs . The data is hard to track historically in a well organized fashion. It doesn't work on Android, shame. Constantly logs you out. Like every time I open it. And support is non-existent.",1
28,com.nike.plusgps,"App used to be much better. Training plans are less useful, there is no technical help within the app and parts of the app consistently stop working. For example, there hasn't been a Feed for over three months and nowhere for me to get any help fixing this. Reinstalled the app, tried deleting and re-adding friends, nothing works. Edit 12/31/23 - starting my new year by moving to an app that doesn't delete my runs, has a feed and has technical support. Bye bye Nike!",1
29,com.nike.plusgps,"App is good, but I have been having issues where my distance is not being recorded within the 1st mile. Its been happening quite a lot lately. **2023 Had to update my review.

30,com.nike.plusgps,"Dont waste your time! This app was incredible. Until it wasn't. I used it for a bit over a year & it worked perfectly. Loved how much data you get from each workout, it cheers you on, the guided runs & advice to make you better. Then it stopped tracking. Gets stuck on 0:08 mins & nothing fixes it. Uninstalled/reinstalled, logged out/in, customer support is clueless. I'm sorely disappointed.",1
31,com.nike.plusgps,"I used to be a happy user of this so y. It has great programs, voicing, features, shoe mileage tracking, etc. It has really gone downhill though, here are some of the frequent issues I experience: inaccurate and inconsistent distance tracking, doesn't always remember I'm logged in, instability (app won't start, or doesn't want to complete the run). Until these are fixed the app is too unreliable.",1
32,com.nike.plusgps,"Looking for a replacement app after this failed to properly track my run so many times. I use a Pixel 2. I frequently am unable to pause the run tracker, or it pauses but won't restart, or it pauses but won't end the run. So my running log now includes a single run that went on for 200+ hours and 18 miles. Great. Currently, I have a notification on my home screen saying ""Nike Run is completing your run"" that's been displaying for a week and I can't dismiss. I press it, and nothing happens.",1

A recent update has changed my satisfaction to Zero. I used to be able to see my mileage as I ran. Now, instead of miles run, I get calories used, a meaningless bit of data as far as I am concerned. And I have no way of changing the settings back to mileage. Very disappointing, enough so that I am looking for a new run tracker.",1
34,com.nike.plusgps,"I started to use this app based off of a friend's recommendation. I'm not impressed... On my very first run, I hit pause to utilize the facilities 3 miles in and my phone crashed. It wouldn't even power back up. I had to purchase a new phone and the very next day, the app kept pausing by itself and I had to keep starting it back. Garbage... Very Disappointed.",1

Bug needs to be fixed asap before myself and a lot of NRC users delete the app! Very disappointing.,1

All the other voiceovers work just fine (status during my run), but none of the guided runs will play. It plays fine when the Powerbeats aren't synced, but refuses to play when I sync. I've reinstalled the app, repaired the Powerbeats, and restarted my device. Wildly frustrating.",1
37,com.nike.plusgps,"After using this app for years, it has bece incredibly glitchy. I can't change settings without the app refusing to record my runs, and I end up having to delete the app and redownload it, potentially losing my rin data at the same time. I used to be able to not change the settings, but that forced me to leave my screen unlocked, and eventually that method stopped working as well, and now my runs pause in the middle of me still running. Overall, Im pissed, and switching running apps.",1
38,com.nike.plusgps,"Inaccurate. Did the speed run ""The Shifter"". Worked through the whole guided run, and it kept tracking after it was finished. I had to restart my phone to stop the run. Also, it only tracked the warm-up and the first two intervals. The continuous tracking after the run made it to where my run time was a 9'30 km pace, which will affect my overall average. I wanted to do speed runs to switch up my usual distance runs. I will stick with other runs until fixed. Update: still not fixed. One star now.",1
39,com.nike.plusgps,"Last Edit: I'm deleting this app for good. It's not stable. Another Edit: Lost another star because of run route accuracy issues I ran a trail that listed itself to be more than 2 miles and the app said I only ran 1 mile.

Sometimes while walking, you can't see your stats. The voice prompt isn't letting me know my milestones. At the end of my walk, none of my miles are calculated. When you manually add data, it's not added to the monthly goal. I'm going to search for a new app because I'm not going to let the inconsistencies of this app break my motivation !",1

It resets your profile and erases your history about every week and if you want to sign in before your run (Because your ,profile was just reset for some reason), the app prompts you with several 30 second timed windows.

42,com.nike.plusgps,"This would be five stars but the glitches are awful. It never remembers you. I have to set it up like I'm a new person every time I use it now. I have to redownload the guided runs over and over - which is especially frustrating because one place I like to run doesn't have cell service so then I have to run without.

These are two very popular platforms. It's natural to assume that in 2023 these two would be compatible.. I hate running with my phone and was really excited to take this experience phone free. But i guess I'll have to ditch NRC. üòí",1
69,com.nike.plusgps,"I love this app and have used it for years. It's had issues in the past, but there are unique features that keep me coming back. The app works great until Nike comes out with an ""update"" and breaks the whole thing. This time I can't access my account and it won't save any of my runs. I tried to log out or change some of the settings and it crashes everytime. I have uninstalled and reinstalled it multiple times and still nothing works. If it's not broke don't fix it!",1
70,com.nike.plusgps,"Loved the guided runs. Hate the bugs. After my last run, it never ""finished my run"", I'm now unable to look at activity or any of the other pages, and my running program I was following is no longer there. Really bummed. The app is essentially useless beside just tracking my run in real time, can't save data, and no guided runs. Will delete if not fixed in the next few days.",1
71,com.nike.plusgps,Update: app has gotten worse! Logs me out and continues to not track my run if I come out of the app to change my music. My biggest issue is that when you start tracking a run and then go to another app (i.e. music) it stops tracking. The time continues but stops tracking your pace and distance. Absolutely ridiculous that I would need to go back into the app after finding music. It shouldn't matter. Then if I go back to edit the run it doesn't count towards my challenge ??? Now that's just dumb.,1
72,com.nike.plusgps,"I can't stop using the app since it has all my running history, and it has indeed jumpstarted me into running. Before the updates in Sept 2019,everything was working great, intuitive! After the update, there were some major bugs that has since been fixed. But the Speed Runs are getting cumbersome. The resting counter is gone and going to the next lap has to be done manually! I called support about this and was told nothing can be done until the next major update. That's not good.",1
73,com.nike.plusgps,"I've used this app for 7+ years. Always happy with it until recently, when like other reviewers, I've experienced it regularly crashes and is not saving my runs. It still tracks and gives splits while you work out, but then something is going wrong with the data actually archiving. Very frustrating and disappointing. Uninstall and re-install does not fix the problem, neither does shutting down app manually. I'm an android user. Hopefully this bug can be fixed, or it's time to give up the app.",1

It hangs and doesn't allow me to complete my run and continues to run in the background, when navigating to the various menus it just brings me back to the run screen, randomly logs me out, etc. I'm going to have to look for another app. Major bummer.",1
75,com.nike.plusgps,"The programs look great, but the app is so buggy it's basically unusable. It will freeze/stall at login, when you're trying to choose a run, when you're trying to save a run, and any other time you're trying to use it. You have to force close the app and restart it, sometimes several times, before it works again (until the next freeze). I wish it worked better, because the coaching programs look great.",1
76,com.nike.plusgps,"Great app for someone just getting into running who needs a training plan. Missing two pretty big features in my opinion. Considering their plans have you run different distances, it would be helpful if there was a way to map your run, like onthegomap dot com lets you. and after completing my first run, I wish the app would tell me when i reached my set distance. accidently ran extra half mile waiting for it to tell me I completed my run. update: getting ""connection error""s and app is unusable",1

Most of the time it wont load or open all the way past clicking the ""log in"" option.

Everytime i start running, i open the app and i have to log in all over again, confirm my account... a mess.",1
78,com.nike.plusgps,"I want to like this app so much! The coaching is awesome, the design of it is cool and you have a lot of variation in the guided runs. Unfortunately, it does a very bad job of the one thing it should be good at; tracking the actual run. Freezes up while I'm out, pauses even though I have the auto pause setting fixed and so many times the run doesn't even save. I'm going to finish up the training program I'm on and then it's over to Strava. I'm sorry Coach Bennett, you're cool but this ain't it.",1

Would like to give 5 stars but this is an annoying issue. Android User.",1
80,com.nike.plusgps,Great for setting a plan that is flexible and easy to follow. The only thing I dislike is that when running sprints it won't tell you that you've reached the distance it wanted you to go so you have to keep checking the app while you sprint. Otherwise a great app for all levels of athletes. Edit: This app jacked my plan all up. I have a slew of saved runs and was excited about completing my first plan after five weeks and now they're all inaccurate and some are even gone. Frustrating...,1

82,com.nike.plusgps,"Update: December 19 No improvement, actually worse since my review. Have to login every time I run. Just spins after every run. I can't update my run info(place, shoes and notes) until the next day. At least once a week the app shuts down and doesn't track my run for the day. Sometimes stops mid run and sometimes just doesn't end the run, just keeps stalling. Thought maybe it was just me, but a few friends have the same problem.",1
83,com.nike.plusgps,"I've had this app almost 10 years. I've been loyal to all the changes done to the format, because somebody felt it needed to be changed. I've dealt with all the glitches, a run didn't get recorded, or was recorded wrong, so on and so on. But after this week's unreliability, I'm done! When 10 years of data is gone, you try to get it fixed and no one has a clue, goodbye loyalty. I had to delete the app, reinstall it and it worked one day. Since it's a free app, I guess you get what you pay for!!!",1
84,com.nike.plusgps,I absolutely love the app. There's a legit great community. What I don't like is the challenges because there's no control measures. Example: Challenge is to run 30 miles in a month. The leader in first place has 3000 miles which is 100 miles a day. No way that's possible. Or maybe they're driving around or something. That's my only complaint. Two years later - the app is very shoty. I have issues with login in on startup as well as it hasn't been syncing well. I still have it but don't use it,1
85,com.nike.plusgps,"The content is excellent, but the GPS doesn't work during certain runs. The GPS doesn't work during distant tracking runs or during meditation runs. The timer and the distance on the app will freeze up, and the training & coaching freezes up as well, so I'm guessing that is where the glitch might be? All these issues were persistent almost a year ago, so I thought I'd give it another try to see if they fixed it, NO THEY DID NOT! Delete again until next year.",1
86,com.nike.plusgps,"I've loved this app for years. Unfortunately, the most recent updates have made it unusable. It logs me in/out multiple times a day, forgets settings, and -- worst of all -- crashes trying to save my data at the end of a run. I've probably run 100 unsaved miles at this point. Super disappointed because I love this app, especially the guided runs. I was hoping I could give it a few weeks and there would be bug fixes, but no luck. I'm going to have to start using something else.",1
87,com.nike.plusgps,"Still has poor tracking. I been trying to keep using the app, but it always gives me inaccurate more times even running the same route. For example, running five miles with two friends I get my 1 mile notice about a quarter mile before they did. One had an apple watch, one was using the UA app on thier phone, I had Nike on my phone. Thiers marked almost the same, I was way off.... Every time! It's been like this since they changed everything and tbh, it looks they could care less if it works",1
88,com.nike.plusgps,"Pro: Tracks overall time well. cons: It'll tell me that a mile took 10 minutes through the headphones, then on the split chart it lists it as 6 minutes. It doesn't interface with music apps just library music. The automatic pause will activate itself often and with no impetus. There are often times where when I lock the phone it just stops tracking distance so there have been times where I ran 3 miles and it logged a half mile that took 26 minutes. Also average pace just disappeared as a feature",1
89,com.nike.plusgps,"I've used this app for many years, but lately it has been messing up, after the workout is finished the data on the run would be incorrect. It doesn't make sense that the data would start messing up, when a few years ago it worked perfectly fine,so it should be improving instead of messing up.

Even as I type this review, it's been loading, almost 20mins after I competed my run. It's still buffering a page as I type this review.

I want to use this app, but don't see any future with it unless this gets fixed.",1
93,com.nike.plusgps,"I started using this app in July of 2021 and it has never worked properly. If you quick launch your camera, you lose the ability to pause your run. Also, on long runs it will fail to upload the data and there is no record of the run. Super frustrating after 18 miles or more. However great it may be in other aspects, it matters little if it can't perform these basic functions reliably. I don't want to use another app, but it seems I might have no other option.",1
94,com.nike.plusgps,"This used to be a fantastic app. I trained for and ran 2 or 3 marathons with this app several years ago. Right now it doesn't seem to do anything correctly except starting up. Doesn't track distance, doesn't reliably stop at the end of a run, doesn't even track the time correctly. It is literally less functional than a stop watch now. Very sad. I'm uninstalling it now. It's not really worth the little bit ot storage it takes up.",1
95,com.nike.plusgps,Used to be great but now it's become more buggy. It logs you out constantly and you have to keep logging in and it takes forever to login.

It just shows a spinner and never saves the run. It just sits and spins both on Wi-Fi and data. Then if you try and close the app you come back.,1

I used this for challenges with a group, and if the app doesn't record your run for some unknown and unstated reason, there's no way to fix it.

As many others have shared, the app no longer will reliably track and save runs. That is the core functionality. If it's not fixed soon people (me) are going to delete it.

It really is inexcusable for such a major player in the running industry to have left out this very important metric. Many runners use cadence as a way to gauge their running economy & efficiency, others aim for a specific cadence range to hit, in order to minimize their injury risk. I'm hopeful that Nike can address this issue in future versions.",2

It does work when I disconnect headphones (tried several brands/pairs). 4) Without the coaching audio, I had no idea what was going on with my ""guided 10 minute run"" which just kept going.

It should be an oval and I'm getting all these skewed images and inaccurate distances. I don't mind editing the distances but wish I could edit the image. Better yet edit the image and it could calculate the correct distance or even have an option to put in standard track and # of laps. Also won't track indoor track runs anymore either.,3

It overestimates consistently. I have validated a routes distance and found that this app calculates my distance and pace at 1.5-1.75 actual. So any distance guided run is useless if you want to run that actual distance. For timed runs and intervals, it's great and I will continue using, but will calculate distance and pace myself.",3

491,com.nike.plusgps,Used to work well now the GPS tracking is so off. At first I thought it was my phone but I use runkeeper in conjunction and the map is always correct. The Nike app seems to always have me running in a straight line. And I have verified it is on the outdoor setting. Glad I have a backup because clearly I can't trust this app at the moment.,3
492,com.nike.plusgps,On my last three runs I noticed that the app would freeze after 3 miles and wouldn't continue tracking my run. So I would keep running more than I normally would (knowing my route completes a 3mile.) And it still wouldn't sync. üò¢ There's some kind of bug!!! The only reason I use this app is because RunRocknRoll uses Nike and not Strava for their virtual races and challenges. üòí,3

494,com.nike.plusgps,"what I love: the coaching programs. they really are tailored to your needs and abilities and I've made a sharp improvement in just a few weeks. what I hate: on the coaching program, I am not able to log a run into the schedule, so while a run I complete is reflected on my history, it is not shown on the schedule as me completing that specific run. Even if I click on the scheduled run before i start it, the app will just treat it as a normal run so I don't have a coach in my ear. too bad.",3
495,com.nike.plusgps,"I like the app and was using it without issue previously, but now experiencing glitches with map (fails to accurately track route) and km vary daily even on the same route (a 6.3km route may come as 5.9 one day or 6.7 the next day),not sure if this varies because some days I walk and other days I jog.. I wish this part was more accurate. Otherwise, I like the display, the voice summary ever km, and the run by run recordings. Hope they fix these glitches soon",3
496,com.nike.plusgps,"Great app to track your miles, pace, time and calorie burn while running. I also like how it allows you to create run challenges with friends. You're also able to join run challenges sponsored through the app. My only gripe with this app is sometimes it doesn't sync certain workouts after I run. This sucks because I lose mileage for challenges. If you manually input them they don't count...so that sucks! Thats the main reason why I gave it 3 stars. Please fix that!!",3
497,com.nike.plusgps,The app has been running great but then all of a sudden the GPS tracking has stopped tracking accurately. I have run the same 3 mile loop for months and now the distance is off and showing up as more and the Nike app map is showing straight lines between odd points. I'm considering moving to another app if I can't get the distance tracking back to normal. Update: saying goodbye to this app. I've tried everything suggested online to get the GPS accuracy back on track and nothing has worked.,3
498,com.nike.plusgps,"Needs option for out of service areas. When I walk/run trails with no cell or wifi service, the app doesn't track my progress and the manual add doesn't count towards challenges?! Many issues such as loss of cell/gps service and treadmill runs cause the app to stop tracking distance. This forces a manual add for the run to be recorded in the app but doesn't count towards goals and challenges. PLEASE FIX!",3
499,com.nike.plusgps,"I have been using this app for years and have always lived it BUT the bugs I have encountered in the past year is annoying.

Before this started happening my average pace per mile was between 10:45/11:00 minutes. Not sure what happened. I uninstalled it a few weeks ago. Going to reinstall and see if it works again.",3
501,com.nike.plusgps,So the app is simple to use but has a major issue. For Wear OS watches that have Connected GPS vs Built in GPS the app will not connect to your phones gps. If you go into the options on the watch or in the app itself there's no way to change it so it connects to use the phones GPS when using your Wear OS watch. Otherwise the app is good but until this is fixed I'll stick with FIT.,3
502,com.nike.plusgps,"Been using this app since 2015 and have really enjoyed it. It tracks all the stats I need it to and provides really helpful stat breakdowns. However, over the last couple weeks it won't let me access anything other than the run tracker, which will track my distance and pace, but not record it down afterwards. In order for the app to work, I need to uninstall and reinstall it after every run, and then manually record my pace and distance just in case the app craps out on me after my run.",3
503,com.nike.plusgps,"This app has potential, and when it works it is AWESOME. I downloaded it bc I want to use the My Coach Program to get back into running.

The audio for My Coach guided runs works inconsistently. My Coach program is supposed to update based on my benchmarks- hope that the unrecognized workouts don't prevent the update!",3
504,com.nike.plusgps,"First and foremost this is a great app for people starting to run. There are coaches and its pretty inspiring to see yourself get better.

And I have trouble with the speed run. My phone is in a band around my arm tracking my run; I CANNOT sit there to start and pause the thing and watch how far I'm running. It's a good thing I didn't cause an accident! The interval runs I have done have told you when to start and stop; why can't the speed runs do this??",3

Also the app is no longer mapping my runs, just shows either a straight line or some circle thing, looks like a buffering symbol.",3
508,com.nike.plusgps,"There are a few things that I think need improvement or options. In the 400/800m intervals, for example the app should automatically reset after each interval so you don't have to hit ""lap"" each time. We have this option in the NTC app so it should be easy to implement in this app. Secondly, it is not allowed to browse guided plans when doing one. This is also available in NTC so... Thirdly, even though it says you can on the website, there is no way to add shoes to track mileage.",3

You can rearrange the schedule it proposes within a week, but not beyond (so M-S only), and there's no way so set preferences like long runs only on the weekend. I do appreciate the coaching, it auto stops if you do, and generally keeps good tracking of my runs. however, I'd also appreciate a fast snapshot feature of my overall progress. The app feels a little more catered to the runners who already know what they're doing",3

I am using the 10K run training guide to train for an upcoming race. For many of the guided runs, the beginning part does not work. Also, I ran a 10K training run and lost the entire run's data.

803,com.nike.plusgps,"It is a good app overall. I had no problems with any of the guided runs since I didn't do them much. The problem I had with the app is that multiple times, I have been kicked out of my account and couldn't log in until the next day. Another problem is that when I do longer runs, the tracking feature of the app pasuses, stopping the miles from being track and the speed of myself giving me incorrect data. This sometimes rarely happens when it is a shorter run as well.",4
804,com.nike.plusgps,"Overall, I really enjoy this app. The guided runs are great, motivational, and keep me moving. My two biggest complaints are how frequently it logs me out, then loses my saved and downloaded runs, and that even in indoor mode, doing a treadmill themed run, it won't store it as completed because it didn't log a distance.",4
805,com.nike.plusgps,"I've been using this app for years and I love using it. However, after the most recent update the app doesn't transition well between resting intervals and working intervals. The app also doesn't stop the runs and I must force stop the app in my phone settings. And I am also having problems with the app logging me out of my account and not allowing me to log back in so I can use the app.",4
806,com.nike.plusgps,"The app is awesome when it works! Lately, some of my runs haven't been saving and I have to redo them. Also, I noticed that something has changed with the audio. When I have Spotify on in the background, the volume would automatically turn up when the coach stopped speaking or turn down when the coach started. Now, I have to manually stop and start Spotify in order to hear the coach. It's super frustrating, especially when you're trying to run!",4
807,com.nike.plusgps,"Update: There used to be a feature to manually apply a run to a training program. Because I didn't complete a run through the app using a guided run, the training program shows them as uncomplete. There used to be a way to manually apply a run to the training programs. I wish that feature would return. The guided runs have changed my view on running for the better. I love doing the training plans as well, just wish there was a plan for 10k. 5k to half marathon is too big of a jump!",4
808,com.nike.plusgps,"It is a love hate. I mostly love it. I typically use the app when I run to track miles and pace. Recently, I took time and found the other features; one being 100k for January. If my miles don't update regularly, I feel frustrated. Feedback on the internet says it will eventually catch up, but please!! Can you fix this? I am incredibly motivated with seeing my miles grow. And it isn't growing. Helllp please!?!",4
809,com.nike.plusgps,"For me, the best part of the NRC app is the coaching. I love getting the instruction, guidance & encouragement from the coaches. Yes, it's all prerecorded, but the guidance I hear is almost always spot on to how I'm feeling & what I need to encourage me to push through. The only reason I'm not giving the app 5 stars is because it frequently logs me out & getting back in can be problematic. I've had to reset my password multiple times because it won't accept that the password saved is correct.",4
810,com.nike.plusgps,"Love the guided runs and the training plans, I've been using this app off and on for years. It does have some weird glitches sometimes with music volume moderation during guided runs - seems like this was caused recently by an update that they need to fix.",4
811,com.nike.plusgps,"Few technical issues, such as opening one of the pages on the sidebar for the page to not load properly, and a single instance where the app stopped working and remove my entire run progress. Overall, the app has motivated me almost everyday to run at a consistent rate and I appreciate this. Highly recommend especially for beginners if you simply want to get started.",4
812,com.nike.plusgps,Great app. It got me into running and consistently too! But there keep being little technical issues. The most recent one is that it won't lower my music volume when any of the coaches are talking so I have to strain to hear them over my music and it really takes me out of the run and makes them a slog to get through,4
813,com.nike.plusgps,"The app is pretty good overall on my Android. The only issues I've experienced is with the weight number settings in the ""About You"" section. Most of the time I'm not able to pick my accurate weight because the app either only accepts or rounds up to odd numbers or even numbers. The other day I tried selecting 213 and it would only either give me 211 or 214 for my weight. This has been a problem for a while.",4
814,com.nike.plusgps,"This app has really helped me get back into running. I like the coaching feature and how it adjusts to your own abilities. The biggest annoyance for me right now is how the Speed Run (interval training) feature doesn't tell you when to run and when to rest. For instance a 4x400 meter run requires running for 400 meters, resting for 2 minutes, then repeating three more times. However, there is no audible notification for the running or rest periods. I think this is a major flaw because it requires me to hold my phone while sprinting, press a button after 400 meters, then switch to timing mode to time out 2 minutes, then press another button to get back to distance mode for the next 400 meters. Even the promotional material for the app shows people wearing their phone on their arms, so how are they going to look to know how far they have run? This is a simple feature that other apps have already done, so I really wish Nike would resolve it quickly.",4
815,com.nike.plusgps,"Love the audio coaching as well as the run planning of ""My Coach"". I just wished they synced up better. when I select the MyCoach scheduled run I don't get the audio (I'm sure some prefer that). When I select the audio, the speed runs are for different sets. the first few audio coach runs had great background music, but the later ones don't seem to have that, and I'd love it if there was an option to bring it back. I don't have playlists on my phone. All in all love it, but want more.",4
816,com.nike.plusgps,"Great app to train for a race (it computes a training plan for you). Can't give 5 stars though because of multiple bugs: screen often freezes (then I have to turn the screen off and on again), the app confuses miles with meters. Also the UI for interval runs is far from intuitive (I have to pause and resume manually between the intervals).",4
817,com.nike.plusgps,"8/10 times this app is awesome! It does have some glitches. Sometimes it will freeze during a run and that results in your data from the run being incorrect. Also, if you run in an area that os covered by trees or something (i.e. trails) the gps tracking can be inaccurate at times. Other than that this app is legit. I like the guided runs that coach you through the workout; especially the fartleks.",4
818,com.nike.plusgps,"For what it is, the app works, not 100% of the time, but maybe 80%. 2hich is enough I guess. I've lost maybe 2 runs due to the app force closing or whatever, which may be the apps fault or my phone's (OnePlus 3t). But besides that, it does what I want it to do, which is mainly track my runs and stats. That's about all I truly expect out of it and it does that well",4
819,com.nike.plusgps,"great, easy app, with challenges and able to add friends. only negative is my runs don't seem to get tracked perfectly. don't know if it's a GPS mistake or what. for example today's run shows me running and cutting through a short cut off of the road and cutting my total run distance. so my distance was shorter and run wasn't tracked correctly on time. I am trying to improve my time, and I am unable to see if I am improving.",4
820,com.nike.plusgps,"Only downside is a run will not stop or pause if phone dies while tracking. Result was a run logged at over an hour long (time continued to run after the phone charged and turned back on, only ending when I realized and manually stopped it). Phone died at end of run, so distance was correct, but duration doubled. Apart from this awesome app! Edit: 'My Coach' feature, does not sync properly with NTC app. Your NTC workouts will not be ‚úÖ'd off and count toward plan. Support couldn't fix bug.",4
821,com.nike.plusgps,"Great for tracking runs, love seeing my progress, splits, and being able to share my run stats! Even has small details from keeping track of miles on shoes to your elevation increase/decrease while tracking. Only problem is sometimes it glitches when you manually pause, put on voice, or audio from app. Would suggest only use to track milage and speed, listen to music or audio on personal app.",4
822,com.nike.plusgps,"I like this app a lot. Well, I used to. Then a lot more bugs started happening. I finished a half marathon training and now it won't let me set up any more training / race preps. Every time I enter my data, it says an error occurred. And now about one in ever 5 runs isn't recorded and is just time with no gps distance tracked. Very frustrating! I've started just running without it and entering my data post run.",4
823,com.nike.plusgps,Review update: changed from 3 stars to 4 stars since the update I'm not having issue logging in as often. I used the half marathon training plan and felt very prepared and had a great race. After looking at other apps I realized how grateful I am that EVERYTHING on this app is FREE. Issues logging in everytime. The guided runs and training programs are great but it's frustrating when I have to try 3 or 4 times before it logs me in successfully.,4
824,com.nike.plusgps,"The changes this app has gone through over the years has been nothing short of awesome. However, the most recent update has affected this app to where I cannot upload my personal pictures to my running posts on Pixel 4 XL, which is bragging rights for social media. That's one of the app's greatest features. Please fix this. Also, it would be nice to check what runs your friends have done in the past.",4
825,com.nike.plusgps,"I recently gave a 2-star review based on wildly inaccurate details of a run. Fortunately it seemed to be a fluke. Unfortunately I can't edit the run without losing the results completely (5 miles vs actual ~3.4). So I have a 5k time 5 minutes faster than my current best. My next run my phone died at 1.99 miles out of actual ~3.4. So these totals equal close to what I ran. I'm not sure I want to ""lose"" those ~7 miles just because I want to edit them. Overall I like the app. üëçüèª",4
826,com.nike.plusgps,"Pretty solid app, though I have some small annoyances. I dont see why the typing doesnt follow traditional grammar rules (auto capitalizing first words, etc) and then every now and I will get a popup for a program that wont go away with the back arrow. All in all though, for the actual running tracking, it's a solid experience.",4
827,com.nike.plusgps,"I've been using this app for a few months and I like the voice guidance, notifying of half-mile or mile markers as chosen, and the clear visuals. I wish it showed pace and distance together instead of having to scroll through. Also, I use a Fossil Swart watch and love it for running but the Nike phone app and Nike Watch app don't sync. I wish they would communicate so I don't have to bring my phone with me all the time.",4
828,com.nike.plusgps,"I absolutely love this app! The coaches are amazing. More than once, they've brought me to tears with their ardent, relentless encouragement. But NRC app developers, please fix the issue in which runs are sometimes not recorded; it's a bit dispiriting. I end up rerunnning those runs so I don't have gaps in my progress. At least give us the option to manually input our times and mark the runs as completed.",4
829,com.nike.plusgps,"i have been using this app for years. I love seeing how I've improved over time, and it helps me keep track of when and where I've slacked off. I also use the training app, which has good pre and post run stretch routines. Only thing I wish, that it synced with different apps. I use narrated running apps to keep me motivated while running instead of the coaches here. Just feels more interactive than gym-ish. Wish I could cross sync instead of having to run them simultaneously, battery.",4
830,com.nike.plusgps,"This app is working as expected. I like the audio feedback so I don't have to worry if my app is still tracking. The only thing I would say they could improve on would be indoor metrics (like on a treadmill). I've semi remedied this by sticking my phone in an old school arm band and strapping the band around my calf. A little uncomfortable, but closer to accurate read out vs. when in my hip pocket. NIKE: Can we get like a little tile tracker for our shoes that syncs with this app?",4
831,com.nike.plusgps,"This app I've been using for over a year now and it has been spot on. It did have about 2 months last year where it was acting up but I believe that was due to a software issue that I've not experienced since. It is spot on. I use two apps, Under Armour and this one to match up and make sure I won't lose my track data. It also follows me to newer phones as well.",4
832,com.nike.plusgps,"I've been using the app for guided runs. The content is great, very inspiring, informative and motivational. The app occasionally logged me out about every 2 weeks.

I am getting a never ending loop after a run when trying to save. it also makes me log in everytime and isn't keeping up with guided runs I have saved.

834,com.nike.plusgps,"*4 stars due to a battery drain issue in the background even after I've ended a workout* Amazing running app! Simple and easy to use with great Google assistant integration. My favorite part is the coaching. It's filled with great reminders of why we run, mental encouragement to keep going, and more. There have been plenty of longer runs where the encouragement comes in at just be the right moment. None of the other apps stack up.",4
835,com.nike.plusgps,The tracking is normally pretty accurate. Offers a variety of run modules to meet all levels of runners. I appreciate the training mode to help meet goals. The coaching modes are great. However at times there are loading glitches after a run. I have lost complete runs because the app didnt load properly after pressing stop. As a result I had to add manually and by doing so it doesn't count towards your accomplishments. But overall a great running app. Along with Nike training app.,4
836,com.nike.plusgps,Love this app for the motivation and everything it has to offer when it comes to guided-runs. I highly recommend for those trying to get into better habits with running. It offers absolutely everything you need for free but the nike shoes to run in. I would give it 5 stars but I have been dealing with a freeze/log in issue when I try and save after my run. Extremely frustrating when you hit a PR and the clock keeps going cause its frozen then when you finally get it working the run never saved,4
837,com.nike.plusgps,"Great app, generally love the guided runs and data tracked, and the training plans. I've done 5k and half marathon and really enjoyed both. Amazing that it's all free. Only downside is it can be a bit buggy for me, so no 5 stars. I find that the audio sometimes gets cut off for guided runs. Which makes runs like speed runs really hard to follow. I also wish I could pair my Samsung Galaxy watch.",4

This is a good app and I used it off and on for years. So please fix the bug.,4
839,com.nike.plusgps,"Overall I love the app for outdoor running. i only wish they made it better for indoor running. Even if you say that you're running indoor on a treadmill, it won't let you track the time of your run. You just have to add it as an additional workout later and that's pretty glitchy. But for inspiring runs outdoor and good plans for races, I love it!",4
840,com.nike.plusgps,"Almost everything works perfectly and the my coach feature has been extremely helpful in guiding my runs. Unfortunately, the elevation hasn't been recorded in my runs but in the app Strava it works fine. Another reoccurring issue is that benchmarks don't set an average pace for my runs. Have tried searching for solutions but as of now haven't found any. Love the app, so fixing these inconveninces would make it 5 stars.",4
841,com.nike.plusgps,"On some of the coached runs it would be useful to know how to best use the app. Like, the first time I had a track workout I hit lap when I completed a lap but then it counted my aimless wandering during the rest. Also it should tell you in a brief tutorial whether it automatically pauses runs and resumes runs for example of you are at a stoplight. I like that the coaching is supposedly adaptive.",4
842,com.nike.plusgps,"It really helps when you want to track miles. You can set different goals by mileage or by time which I like. I go back and forth with goals for myself. The only bad thing is I haven't figured out why my Jabra elites won't let me do the guided runs anymore, disappointed by that feature bc I really liked doing some of the voice over guide runs.",4

I still can't figure out why they chose the particular distances for each particular Run Level. The music playing portion of the app is weird though, I wouldn't use it. Just use whatever music app you normally use. I like that it meets you track how much distance you have put on your shoes.",4

Then as I was preparing for a run it glitched...it wouldn't open completely but never gave me the option to turn it off, it was frustrating to say the least.

Currently trying out the ""coached plan"", which seems quite interesting. On the treadmill: While it does quite a good job of tracking the distance, I find it quite inconvenient to use. There's no explanation on what to do/focus on on the treadmill. When you're doing a sprint set, it doesn't inform you when you finished the distance or the pause.",4
849,com.nike.plusgps,"Love this app! The guided runs are great, the audio feedback options are good (you can choose time or distance intervals) and the interface is pretty. Plus, it's free! The features it's lacking is split pace in audio feedback and being able to see split pace of intervals less than a mile. You will also want to double check the accuracy of the distance - my husband and I run together sometimes, both using this app, and our apps will show big differences in distance (3/4 mile in a 3 mile run)",4

I've tried some other apps for running before, but this one really helps with setting all different kinds of goals and creating a schedule for you. The only complaint I have so far is that the tracker seems to be off. I track my runs through Fitbit as well, and that app always tells me I actually ran much slower. I've had a friend tell me that this also doesn't work great on treadmills. Still, this works great if you're just starting out training.",4

HATE that the interval runs don't work, especially since they seem to be about a third of my app generated training plan. The distance of each interval is tracked, but the transition into rest is not triggered. Makes using the app for the interval runs impossible.    Also, how crazy is it that I cannot file a bug report via email or through the app. The only options I see in-app under 'contact us' is to give them a call them or to reach out on twitter.",4

856,com.nike.plusgps,It's a great motivator app.. without this app I couldn't have maintained my running routine in the past four months greatly improving my time. It's got some issues too. For instance if a run had error such as GPS being turned off it would not alert me.

Usually it comes back at the next segment, but sometimes it bugs on intervals and I miss the start of an interval. My music from YouTube Music doesn't cut out so it's not the headphone connection. As for an easy suggestion, it would be really cool if, when viewing a past activity, tapping on the distance at the top toggled between miles and meters!",4
858,com.nike.plusgps,"I still consider one of the best running apps out there, but it's not perfect. What really makes it better than anything else is its ability to connect to other fitness apps, specifically, Nike Training Club.

Also there is a super annoying bug that when I run indoors, the run will pause if the phone gets rotated at all. That REALLY needs fixing.",4
872,com.nike.plusgps,"Great app, wish for better Wear OS connectivity. Using the Half Marathon training program, which is great, but the wear OS app just lets you start/stop a separate run from the one in the program. Since my phone is in an armband, it would be SO much easier if there was a Programs section on watch menu to start that specific audio-guided run, otherwise, no real benefit to using a watch in addition to phone. OR, when the set run is open in-app, when Start is pushed, sync and make that the run.",4
873,com.nike.plusgps,"i love this app! i use the plans they have to keep on track ans i like the feature where you can free run, but select a goal, like a goal time or mile selection. i use this in conjunction with the Nike Training Club and i have nothing but good things to say. I've been consistent with my running and i enjoy the variety of exercises that are provided. 5/12/2020: I've been having trouble with the distance measurement . It doesn't track my routes accurately",4
874,com.nike.plusgps,"Guided runs really help you learn pace, effort, and how to train running. Ran for 15 years prior to using app, and learned so much. Renewed my passion for the sport! The app doesn't always work well (I have an Android). Periods of the app not saving or recording my runs or the GPS not working. It's weird because the audio will play fine, and the nonguided runs will tell me the mile markers during the run. Just nothing to review afterwards",4
875,com.nike.plusgps,"Generally one of the better apps for running in my opinion. The only thing I've noticed when running on a track as compared to running in my neighborhood is that the distance will vary slightly. Also, when running with friends, even if we are next to eachother our distance might vary. I don't know if it has something to do with the gps. Besides that the app is pretty great!",4
876,com.nike.plusgps,"Overall is has been a very helpful app when it comes to training for different races. However, lately when I select a run it has a guided and a non-guided version. I always pick guided but half the time it doesn't have the guide on my run, sometimes I restart and it fixes it but most of the time this does not resolve itself.",4
877,com.nike.plusgps,"Gteat app to track your runs and progress though it has one major drawback. It assumes you can already have some experience when taking on running. It would be great to see a couch to 5k plan being offered, until then it's better to get into after you can run 15-20 minutes at a time. I use the time splits from a couch to 5k training app and just use those in the 'start a run'>speed screen. I find the stats it tracks more helpful than the other app.",4
878,com.nike.plusgps,"Good for the most part. Easy to use and I like the voice advising times on the benchmark run . 2 things I do not like are that you cannot have more than 1 training existing. Once you start new training you have no info to look back at any prior. Second no voice on any runs except benchmark, so you have to look at phone to know when you have gone 400 meters every time (last time for me 7 times) or 800 meters or anything but benchmark. Makes it hard to do and I accidentally bump each time.",4
879,com.nike.plusgps,I really like this app eve for just walking. I feel it is more gps consistent than the andriod preinstalled app. However lately there seems to be a glitch or bug. After I press stop and complete my run it only gives me the option to discard my run. I have to update manually but it does not count towrd any of the goals i selected i hope this is fixed soon.,4
880,com.nike.plusgps,"I really like the active parts of the guided runs. The coaching had been really useful for me to learn about recalibrating my effort on each run which allows me to enjoy running more & hopefully it'll stick as a habit now. I'd like the guided runs to have coaching the whole time and/or pause my music in Google Play when the coach is talking. Sometimes it's too much competing noise because although it does make the music quieter, sometimes it isn't quiet enough. I'd like distance to be in miles.",4
881,com.nike.plusgps,"Very good app in terms of being motivational but for me being a novice runner, I'd love if there were more tip basics for the beginner such as when and how to stretch, breathing techniques while running, eating pre and post run, water and snack dos and don'ts while running, positioning the body while running, muscle attention and focus during a run, and lastly mental focus during a fun. Not too much to ask, right? üòú",4
882,com.nike.plusgps,"I love this app! Great coaching for beginners and people that just don't feel inspired to run on their own. My only complaint is sometimes the app glitches and I have to re-download it to get my saved info to come back up. That's only happened a couple times over the few years that I've had the app so it's not terrible, but slightly inconvenient.",4
883,com.nike.plusgps,"I love this app. It's helped me become a runner and the guided runs are amazing. Lately it hasn't been taking my runs though. I have done everything app support told me to do including deleting and installing again multiple times but I've been having to plug in my miles manually and ""loosing"" my runs which honestly kind of ruins my runs. Please fix this, I don't want to have to use another running app. I love this one too much.",4
884,com.nike.plusgps,"Overall beautiful app for tracking runs. Downside is that if you're running with a group there's likely to be pretty great disparity between the distance tracked... I wish you could group up for when you're running with a partner. Also the create a plan option is a joke, it's a fine running plan, but it doesn't give any more customizing for you than hard, easy, fast. It should give a time goal.",4
885,com.nike.plusgps,I'm using NRC to train for my first 10k and the guided runs have been everything for me. I was skeptical at first but the coaches are good at keeping you motivated while not bugging you too much or being too cheesy. The location/distance tracking seems to work well (I haven't tested it against true distance) and the app looks very nice. Only 4 stars because I wish they had a 10k plan IN the app. Also the music pairing is a bit confusing.,4
886,com.nike.plusgps,Great app easy to use and keep track of progress. Only issue I've had thus far is some runs weren't saved and just disappeared üòï ü§∑ from my run activity records the app. I simply stopped to take a sip of water. It paused my run and as I continued it just reset my progress. Which was a bummer. This happened twice already. Not sure but Nike should really look into it.,4
887,com.nike.plusgps,"This is amazing! I've had it for a long time, and now is a good time to rate it after extensive use. I love the decision to have a motivational trainer run with me or not. The only bad thing, or thing I'm not a fan of, is every quarter or so, about three months, the app logs you out and you lose most of your progress. So it is heartbreaking to see this gap in your training. I do hope they address this. Other than that, great app that is completely free. Way to go, Nike!",4
888,com.nike.plusgps,"I wish it would work with various big brand and small brand fitness trackers especially for heart rate monitoring. Would also be cool if it integrated with Google Fit. The only bug I have noticed is around GPS accuracy. Me and my running partner have run the same route and our logged distances were different. Also, her app kept pausing and unpausing as we were jogging. Mine was fine. Even though I only do performance training and sports in Nike; it is cool that the app sees other brands",4
889,com.nike.plusgps,"When I first got the app (2015) the distance/time tracking was perfect. Now I experience ""dead zones"" during runs and have to edit the distance back. This seems to want to change my time to reflect my pace. Still works well though. I recommend it as it's free, and you can do challenges with friends!",4
890,com.nike.plusgps,"Love the instruction while running and being able to still listen to my music. While running though, if someone calls me, it is impossible to get my music and the commentary to start back. Extremely frustrating. My run continues to be tracked but I can't get any sound to start back. Not sure if it's the app specifically.",4
891,com.nike.plusgps,"App is really good, however it fails in guidance for speed training like 4x400. In this case you have to constantly check the app in order to stop running and start the rest. Then when you are resting you have to check countdown in order to start running again. There is no guidance on when you complete the 400 meters or when you finish your two minutes rest. Overall is very good training app",4
892,com.nike.plusgps,"The audio guided runs in this app successfully trained me through my first half marathon and I'm starting the training up again for my 2nd. The audio still sometimes cuts out before the coaches can finish their statement, but it's still really good for a free running app. The ability to track miles in my shoes is an added bonus.",4
893,com.nike.plusgps,"Very reliable and useful! I use it every day. Might be helpful to add a message feature with friends to coordinate challenges. Also, the pace, time, and distance never quite agree. For example, 1 mile at 8 minutes calculates a 7:57 pace. Minor, but probably something that can be easily fixed in the algorithm. Overall very happy!",4
894,com.nike.plusgps,"This app is phoenominal for novice and experienced runners alike. Grest interface, great distance and speed tracking, and it works w spotify. My only gripe is with the guided runs. Yes they are 100% chock full of wisdom and useful information to make u better, but they are SO WORDY! Maybe create runs for newbies with all the talking and ones for experienced folk where its dialed back some? Idk. Either way well worth the download. Goes with me on every run.",4
895,com.nike.plusgps,I like the app in general. I enjoy the variety of runs it offers but what I don't like are when I put my phone in my stroller for some reason the app always pauses and doesn't register that I'm running. Multiple times it completed my workout before I was done and I couldn't go back and log that I had done the run. There seem to be some little glitches that are annoying. Another positive however is that it updates my schedule if I miss some days to keep me on track. 3* for glitches 4* for runs,4
896,com.nike.plusgps,"Great App! I use it all the time to track my running. It also syncs with my garmin watch when I do a run with that instead. Occasionally, it does stop tracking my run if I'm using another app, such as an app for listening to music or podcasts, which is frustrating. However, 90% of the time it does exactly what I want to to do.",4
897,com.nike.plusgps,"This is truly a great app! Love the adapting plan and the guided runs! I have used this for a long time and it always helps me get back on track. They now allow you to add shoes of other brands as well. Love the new kinds of challenges and guided runs. Not a fan of the training app integration. I train separately, with Nike I want to run ;-) Integration with spotify on Android not possible unfortunately, which takes off a full star for me.",4
898,com.nike.plusgps,I'm a fitness professional and I absolutely love using this app and recommend it to many of my clients. Didn't give it 5 stars only because every time the app updates it stops working and I have to uninstall and reinstall it. After the reinstall it works as normal. Luckily none of your previous data gets erased when it happens. At least so far it hasn't.,4
899,com.nike.plusgps,"The application is good for what I use it for. It has a lot of bugs, but I figured that's due to connectivity while running. A few times this application told me I ran back to back 5 seconds. It ruins my achievements and records, but I'm not using that app for that. Other than that, it works on keeping track of your miles.",4

Literally every few dozen steps, it pauses the workout, then resumes an arbitrary amount of time later - EVEN WHILE RUNNING AT FULL BORE. I've loved this app for like a year, and just two runs after the update, I'm considering leaving it behind. This is wholely unusable in the current state. Please revert to last week's version!!!!!!!!

912,com.nike.plusgps,1/2024: Still my favorite app to train with. There's a strange glitch on the interval guided runs where the timing doesn't match up with the first interval after the stretch break. Ended up with an extra 3 minutes on the first interval the other day. 2/2023 The guided runs are back and I'm loving it once again. These runs are the main motivation for getting up and going for me. Thank you for fixing that and restoring all of my past runs.,4

1000,com.nike.plusgps,Love this app..it can be guided and can play your music as well..i found a few friends on it and you can cheer them on as they run..very cool.. The only problem I've been having is if I use my watch to run it doesn't contribute my mileage to the challenges only to the club. Which defeats the purpose of being able to workout distraction free..so I always have to run with my phone in order to have my mileage added to my challenges..A bit frustrating üòë,5
1001,com.nike.plusgps,"Great app and best part it's free! The trainings, coaches and challenges are great and it connects to google fit. Only thing I wish for in future uodate is to be able to configure so we can show Pace and Miles in bigger font numbers on the main screen. It only shows time in big numbers which is great for race. But would be great to toggle to pace or miles shown in big readable fonts. UPDATE was able to install in pixel 2 watch, back to 5 stars. Best app for running.",5
1002,com.nike.plusgps,"I've been using the app for a few weeks and its a great measuring tool, also motivating, and increased self-awareness while running. Guided runs are cool! I typically train alone, swimming, garage wods, etc, but this app is like having a training partner/coach! The in app music worked once but I am able to just use my own music app and I still hear the coach. Also my Garmin Forerunner partnered but runs aren't tracking in Garmin Connect. These are the only difficulties I've had!",5
1003,com.nike.plusgps,"Great app to help track runs both inside and outside. Very helpful with feedback and the statistics of your runs, in regards to timing, elevations, pace, distance to go, distance covered. Also, the ability to customize the feedback as well, if you prefer not talking at all or if you want that coach in your eat during the runs, perfect for the beginners to keep on hammering. Only complaint, is that my Samsung galaxy watch is not able to download app to track, so I always need my phone on me.",5
1004,com.nike.plusgps,"I.ve been using the app less than two months. My friend invited me to join her in a challenge. I really like being able to pick, the time and/or distance, I use most. The best thing is the halfway mark is called out which is a plus because, I usually listening to a Podcast or YouTube. I.m testing the app, so its a keeper, for now.",5
1005,com.nike.plusgps,"Such a simple to use app, this is perfect for everyone from a beginner who just wants a way to track their pace to an advanced runner who needs second by second data on their pace, elevation, breaks, etc. I would definitely pay for this app if nike decided to add trails and more personalized training to the app but kept the interface simple. The milestones also help out a lot in terms of feeling like being part of a running community and with motivation to getting out there and running.",5
1006,com.nike.plusgps,This is the best running app. I haven't tried any of the others but I can't imagine that they are any better than this. We interface isn't that great. But there's a million runs. And all of the content is amazing. The headspace runs are super inspiring. The interviews with world class runners are super inspiring and humbling and motivating. I'm glad this is a free app. I feel like the content is too valuable to be behind a paywall. The whole world should get a chance to experience this.,5
1007,com.nike.plusgps,"Since 2014, I've only used it for straight runs, then decided to explore recently. I realized there were challenges and guided runs. It definitely increases motivation. Also never knew till recently that I could add run stats to photos after the run for social media. ü§¶üèª EDIT 9/2023: Galaxy Watch 4 user: UI update 5.0 finally has this for watch 4 use. Great to finally add BPM to the NRC app.",5
1008,com.nike.plusgps,"Update: Oct 4, 2023 - No more guided run talks getting cut off! My only (small) issue is music volume being low sometimes when the app switches between a guided run talk to my music but it's not low enough where I can't hear the music, just lower than I'd like. Still a 5-star app for me.",5
1009,com.nike.plusgps,"Outside of some small bugs, this is a great app. For what you get for free, and for the amount of worthwhile coaching you receive - especially for beginners - there's nothing comparable. Has the ability to help you make real and lasting changes in your life. No hyperbole.",5
1010,com.nike.plusgps,Perfect run tracker. I've been using this app since 2017 from Estonia through Europe and across America. Being able to see your runs throughout the years and monitoring your time and distance really gives that extra boost of motivation to see how far you can push yourself. It's the continuous goal setting rhat never gets old. Only issue I have is that I have to log in every freaking time I open the app. Plus there needs to be more diverse figures on the front like native Americans specifically.,5
1011,com.nike.plusgps,"The purpose of the app is great, it trackes my runs well, the guided runs are fantastic, and the training plans are helpful. The downside is it doesn't work with my Samsung watch so I have to have both tracking while I run. Also the app has been logging me out when not in use, when I open the app I have to log back in and all of my download guided runs are no longer downloaded. It also takes time to get back my activity log when it logs me out which is frustrating.",5
1012,com.nike.plusgps,"Great app overall. I accidently found NRC after losing my watch and having to run with my phone. I tried several different apps, but I found this one and Coach Bennett to be the best. You also have intermittent quiet time during the sessions, which is great for prayer. Just make sure you turn off any other apps that auto detect workouts or it will cause the gps accuracy will be way off. I recommend trying it out if you could use some extra motivation or structure to take you to the next level.",5
1013,com.nike.plusgps,Very solid app! The circuits are set up so you can easily track your improvements and the breathing tips are key. Plus the demos are shot from different angles for better from. I really enjoy the recommended workouts which are based off your previous workouts. I haven't paid into the app yet but I can still workout from my saved workouts back when there were monthly plans. I really miss the monthly plans!,5

My only issue right now is the new update! My last 3 runs, after I posted it on my feed, are nowhere to be found. It also did not add to my challenges. Please fix this asap! Looking at my recorded runs adds fuel to my motivation.",5
1015,com.nike.plusgps,"Offers most of what Strava has but completely free. The guided runs are amazing and can be played simultaneously with Spotify (does not pause music which is awesome.) Only complaint is the Wear OS app does not run simultaneously with the phone app. They do synchronize post run, I'd love to see it where the phone detects you've started a run on your watch and simultaneously runs it on your phone. (Strava suffers from this also.) Been using Strava 2 years now, may switch over to this full time.",5
1016,com.nike.plusgps,"The app sometimes doesn't allow the runs to be synced. The run will save, but it won't sync, so it won't add to my total miles, so I can't fully track my distance progress. Overall though, very good app. I highly recommend it for anyone who is a consistent runner, or even a casual runner.",5
1017,com.nike.plusgps,"Love this app. The tracking is helpful, but the guided runs is what makes me come back again and again. The one negative I have found is the speed run...it is super awkward to hit all the buttons while you are doing the workout. It should be automstic... this app works on distance covered and time, so it should not be hard to do.",5
1018,com.nike.plusgps,"This app has been the perfect way for me to start running again. I love how the coaches during the guided runs tell me ""good job"" and that I'm ""looking good."" The encouragement and the reminder to check my form has helped my physical stamina. There's an option to play music in the background, so between my running playlist and the recorded coaching, I don't get bored and I run faster than I used to.",5
1019,com.nike.plusgps,"I have been running for 5 years and with the nike + run app for all of it. I love that you can set goals and it builds out a schedule for you. The Guided Runs are my favorite!

I love the variety of the Guided runs, different distances and purposes, and even special guests outside of athletes!",5
1020,com.nike.plusgps,"One of my fave apps. Like how it gives me so much data and all I have to do is push a button to start and stop a run. Have enjoyed some guided runs too. It helps me stay more consistent and motivated. There's a lot of consideration out into this app, a lot to explore (try adding your shoes, where you ran, personal note, etc) In a perfect world I could sync with my Fitbit watch.",5
1021,com.nike.plusgps,"I use this every time I run. Run with location on so the mileage will be more accurate. I like that it tracks my pace as well as altitude of my run. It gives me my average pace and total run time every mile. It pauses when I stop (rather, when my dog stops) so the stops don't affect my pace as much. Sometimes, when I finish a workout, a recording from a celebrity plays to encourage you to keep up the run! :)",5
1022,com.nike.plusgps,Love the app! Great programs and easy to use. My only gripe would be when you do the sprint portion of the program it's not guided. Ex: 9√ó200 you have to hit pause but you need to keep looking down to see if you hit the 200 Mt mark if you're not in a track. Not a big issue but would be nice if it let you know when you hit it or it autostopped and took your split,5
1023,com.nike.plusgps,"Love this app! I use to hate and dread running but since using this app I enjoy it and look forward to my runs. My pace and duration have improved significantly, I've lost a fair amount of weight too. Coach Bennett is the best!! My only critique is that sometimes the app will glitch and not record the run correctly but this has only happens a few times and I've been using it consistently for 4 months.",5
1024,com.nike.plusgps,I feel off my roof Nov of 2018 and broke my knee and fibula at 40 years old. They had to rebuild both. 14 months later I moved past rehab and am starting to exercise. With our mild winter I've been able to get out and pound some pavement or walk some trails. The app is great. It works with my goals and I can adjust them as my goals increase. The GPS feature has pretty accurate distance calibration. I've read both positive and negative reviews but tried it. Works great for me. Recommended!,5
1025,com.nike.plusgps,"Great app overall. Unfortunately, it can't be used on the treadmill as it won't accurately log your miles. I learned this the hard way and had to restart a 5-mile run (outside in the rain) after 3.5 miles on the treadmill. Recently It's proven to be inconsistent with the voice notification for mile completions. So you have to run with the phone in your hand to keep track, instead of strapping it to your arm to run hands-free. But, it's a free app, so no indignant entitled rant from me.",5
1026,com.nike.plusgps,"I use to run but now I'm mostly a walker so my opinion isn't worth much... but I love this app! It's free, its reliable, its encouraging, functions well with my music app in the background. My only complaint is the GPS is accurate for distance but the markers on the map aren't true to my running/walking area. Probably due to my phone being old and the GPS sending signals every 2 seconds instead of every 1 second. Highly recommend this for beginners and intermediate.",5

Guided runs are really helpful. *edited and downgraded from 5 to 3 stars after experiencing my first major glitch. I just completed my first speed run and it won't save the workout. The clock is still running an hour and a half later even after a reboot. Now I'm going to try a clean install, but I've lost my workout.",5

I can't get the music to work through this app, but I just play it and the voice comes over my music so no big deal. I have used this app and Strava simultaneously twice and I get the same pace and distance. I think people saying the distance is off may need to adjust their GPS settings.",5
1029,com.nike.plusgps,"Been using this app since 2013 when it had a different name - seen a lot of changes and overall it's still a great experience. Audio guided runs are a lot of fun and helped me a lot getting started running. I'm happy with the level of detail in the tracking (splits, pace, elevation, etc) but probably isn't the most robust option. Really wish there was a browser/desktop component for reviewing run data/routes/etc - but otherwise it's been a blast.",5
1030,com.nike.plusgps,"Love this app! Two things I would ask for in improvements. 1. If the app had an option to keep my phone screen ON through the entire run. I hate looking at the app to check my pace or distance and then having to hit a button to make my screen come on. 2. If there were a way to display the info from my last run, or even my overall average info, during my current run so I could compare them in real time would be awesome. Keep up the good work!",5

The ability to use your own Spotify playlists/podcasts is also nice. As someone who used the app to get into running, I really appreciate that the achievements you get are focused on your own progress. You don't feel like your competing against other people. I found that they encouraged rather than discouraged me and helped me stick with running.",5
1032,com.nike.plusgps,"This app truly succeeded my expectations. Was shown it by a friend who uses it and have been blown away ever since. there's so much to it that I can't even list it all, but a few are monthly running challenges, sweepstakes entries for completing tasks, and workouts that actually make you better at running. I have never been a fan of running but I have run almost 14 km in the last three days just because I love using this app!",5
1033,com.nike.plusgps,Great app! The guided runs are a tremendous help in keeping you focused and motivated if you do not have a running partner. The tracking data gives you an accurate way to gauge your progress especially if you have a device that monitors heart rate linked. This app has been an amazing help to me! I tell everyone to download it if they are considering running often.,5
1034,com.nike.plusgps,"I still can't believe this app is free. It has everything I've ever wanted in a running app and things I didn't know I wanted. I love the custom training programs. They really are the most customizable I've seen. You can choose how hard. Long and often you want to train. The mileage tracking is awesome. I get informative notifications during my run. The app also quickly pauses if I stop and starts back up. There are music options, ways to share your runs and great guided runs!!!",5
1035,com.nike.plusgps,"This app provides great motivation during the run, and even after. As you are running, the app can give you updates along segments of the run (completely customizable). The updates let you know you're progress without making you look at your phone! After the run, you can view your new achievements and review all the details of the run. The app overall is very easy to use, and the display while on a run contains all the information you need while being very easy to read. Great running app!",5
1036,com.nike.plusgps,"Clean interface. Easy to use. Sometimes parts of run get cut off but it seems that only happens when you have another app running that uses your GPS. Overall the best run tracking app I've used. One annoying thing (that doesn't really matter, but annoying nonetheless). There are lots of people who cheat on the leaderboards. Like why?",5
1037,com.nike.plusgps,This is a great app to use to stay on a regular Run cycle.the only downside I've seen is that it doesn't really work for somebody who's truly new to running especially somebody that is overweight and literally just starting to run. The coached aspects of this app or great. They are motivational on track a lot of good data. But it is hard to apply to somebody who is walking 3/4 of the workout initially. However it is still usable and down the road it will be good to look back on those early ones,5
1038,com.nike.plusgps,"Haven't run into any errors yet! I was using MMR and couldn't get it to stay connected to the app, it was just very frustrating and annoying to use. NRC app is amazing. different measuring units, accurate map tracking, perfect amount of notifications that, personally, make me feel accountable enough to get up off my rump and meet some goals. I am really enjoying the Nike Run Club app!! it's perfect for me so far and i would recommend it to anyone.",5
1039,com.nike.plusgps,"The app is simple, quick, and unobtrusive. If you're looking for something to track your miles, pace, etc, this is an easy reccomend. I don't use some of the extra features, like the guided runs ans what have you, so I can't comment on them. But I will say, if you're consistent with your runs the app will give you random messages praising your commitment. Again, very easy reccomend.",5

This is also without using the coaching features and guided runs, I can only imagine how helpful those are. As someone who used to despise running this is a perfectly suited app for me. The notifications remind you to run and even if you run just once a week you can achieve marks for consistency. Download it, use it, and most importantly keep running!",5

The milages earned during Speed Runs (required in the coaching programs) do not count towards mileage in Challenges. I recently discovered this error and had lost over 50 miles being applied towards my Challenges. If this could be remedied, I would greatly appreciate the extra motivation! In fact, the gamification combined with the Nike community is my favorite aspect of the app.",5

It supports my drive to run fast and work hard, but the guided runs also remind me that doing so isn't always sustainable.

Also, I can still listen to third party music (score!)",5

So, in the workout logs, no option for treadmill or to manually enter your distance. I'm not too hung up on it, as my main tracker is Training Peaks.",5

1069,com.nike.plusgps,It's really fun running with this app. It reads your distance and speed with a lot of accuracy and even let's you know each time you pass a mile/kilometer mark (depending on your settings) and tells you your current time and average pace. Really handy for people trying to maintain a steady pace or build up more speed. The app runs in the background and allows for other apps to play music.,5
1070,com.nike.plusgps,"Love everything about this app, except for the speed test function. Unless you have a smart watch or you pre measure the intervals, there is no way to know when you complete a rep without looking at your phone while running, which is both dangerous and makes the speed test rather redundant.",5
1071,com.nike.plusgps,"One of the best apps I've used. Coach Bennett is consistently great. Sometimes he can come off a bit cheesy but always motivating, empathetic and genuine. He really just wants to help you and thousands of others have a better relationship with running. The interface, tracking, and goals are super slick and functional, too. Can't recommend this app enough.",5
1072,com.nike.plusgps,"I hardly ever rate apps or provide reviews but the Nike Run Club app might be the best app I've ever downloaded. It feels like it delivers on everything that apps were supposed to do for us: it's made me a better, more confident runner without overwhelming me with notifications at all times. I downloaded it with the first week or so of starting to run and I use it every time i run now. the guided runs are perfect for times when you dont feel like running. I love them.",5
1073,com.nike.plusgps,I've been using this app on and off for the last years. I love that the app keeps me motivated by giving me badges when I am consistent. The coaching workouts are great too. I wish the app would stop logging me out though. Not sure why it does that when I'm the only one who has ever used the app on my phone. There's also exclusive discounts you can get for being a nike member and participating in challenges. Over all a great appfor beginners and more experienced runners. Playlist r choice 2,5
1074,com.nike.plusgps,I first downloaded this about in 2019 and only used it a couple times and didn't run for almost a year afterwards. I've picked it back up and it is so helpful to have a plan already made for you that provides accountability as well as a reasonable starting point based on numbers you plug in. It also challenges you to go just a little bit harder than you normally would. My problem has always been running too fast or too long which makes running miserable and burns me out. This app fixes that.,5
1075,com.nike.plusgps,Helped me train for my first marathon. The coaching and podcasts are nice for really long runs that you might not be used to or that you want to do better on. I like that you can set goals for your length or speed and the app will update you on your progress via audio so you don't have to worry about staring at a screen as you are running.,5
1076,com.nike.plusgps,I don't normally write reviews but I LOVE THIS APP! FREE AS FREE CAN GET. Most other apps require payment for training or even routes. Not this one. It's free! Pick your marathon or half date and it will guide you to the finish line. I love coach Bennetts guided runs. They are so perfect. You will be missing out if you don't get it.,5
1077,com.nike.plusgps,"Never been a runner my whole life. Best milenhad been 15 minutes walked as a kid. The app provides a great interface, easy access to runs, and excellent coaching and motivation to get couch potatoes such as myself out and running. I've been running consistent for 6 weeks now and am hitting paces and durations I never thought I could. My only gripe is the lack of a progression for beginners past the getting started program. Regardless, I recommend the app for anyone wanting to get into running.",5
1078,com.nike.plusgps,"I love how it shows you the route you ran with GPS, and the route lines change colors showing you how fast you were running at that point. you can play music through the app, and it gives you an update every mile about your pace and how far you ran, and total time. I love this app. I'm going to be using this app for many years. and it's all free",5
1079,com.nike.plusgps,"Pretty accurate. Love the option where it tells me how I'm doing and far I have left if I preset the distance or time. Autopause is very annoying but, can easily be turned off. Also love that it keeps running in the background and I can use other apps at the same time.",5
1080,com.nike.plusgps,"This has to be the better running app that I've used. It seems to be the most accurate and even has an auto pause when you stop to tie your shoes! However I do wish that during the run, you could customize how often the app will tell the distance you've traveled. I can only get it to notify me after a mile run.",5
1081,com.nike.plusgps,"Great for tracking runs. You can set a distance goal, time goal, or just start running. A great feature to add would be to allow for warm-ups/cool-downs: either automatically detected or manually entered. You could then see statistics about pace/speed/distance for just the main run or with the warm-up/cool-down included.",5
1082,com.nike.plusgps,"Been using this app since 2011 and have never had any issues with it. The tracker seems to be well calibrated and accurate as compared to my Garmin. The gps feature works great when outdoors but that could vary I'm assuming based on cell phone carriers and reliable data. overall great app, reliable, user friendly, and fun to use.",5
1083,com.nike.plusgps,"I am having a great time running thanks to this app. Thanks NRC and Coach Bennett. I like coach's voice and encouragement. I am loving the challenge and surprising myself with how much I can do. The app doesn't work 100% great for me because it stops working when I get a notification so I have to put my phone on ""do not disturb"" while using it, but it's NBD.",5
1084,com.nike.plusgps,This app is amazing. I'm absolutely in love with it. Not only can you track your runs with this but it also gives you options to run to (like 45 mins-1 hr or slow or fast paced). You can also create a personalized work out schedule just for you and it also has different options for different goals. You can set the mileage for your shoe and even shop for a new pair. This app is amazingly versatile and I love it. 10/10 would recommend.,5
1085,com.nike.plusgps,"ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS APP!! I'M HOOKED!! Look I'M not going to go on and on about how great this app is (because it really is fantastic and I use it everyday and challenge my friends). However, here are some things you could add or improve on: - Please add more levels/increase the level for Volt (literally anything please) - Smartwatch support (None) - Add more achievements or ability to create challenges and make our own achievements. I could go on... But great app and PLEASE update sooooon ‚úåüëç",5
1086,com.nike.plusgps,Not only does it track your runs but i love how it saves/ rewards/ and benefits not just me but others to be the best version of themselves. King of an app before Instagram and facebook UI improved. Nike has been killing it! Just wish they have every 15 minute auto save on runs. Im afraid of my phone dying and not saving my run which has happened. But mostly my fault haha. Get the app! Best things ive ever done ‚ù§,5
1087,com.nike.plusgps,"Phenomenal free features, that other apps charge for! The last time I used this app was 5 years ago. A friend recently recommended it to me due to it's coaching/programming feature. You can select what race your goal is, the date of the race, and then the app will give you a training program to follow, all for free!!!",5
1088,com.nike.plusgps,"NRC is my favorite app now. Logs all my miles, and other stats. Also, gives trophies or achievement rewards for different milestones and personal records. Another cool thing is the fact that it keeps track of my miles on my shoes and I can have more than one pair in the app. All these things i was trying to do on my own before a family member pointed the app out to me. I have not gotten into the guided runs yet, but will come back and add more if I do. Would definitely reccomend NRC to runners!",5
1089,com.nike.plusgps,I like how the app will track how fast I go throughout a run and that it tells me my pace at each interval I select. This helps me to know how fast or slow I am going for my training. The app functions great and I have had zero issues using it. It is really helpful to see how well I am improving through my runs. Highly recommend for anyone looking to improve their running.,5
1090,com.nike.plusgps,Good but frustrating. I love the app and have been using it for years. However the last couple months it keeps crashing mid-run or wants me to login/join everytime I open it and then it freezes. I've had to uninstall and reinstall numerous times. I've gotten a new phone in that time and have the same issue so it's not my phone.,5
1091,com.nike.plusgps,"I am really liking this app. The coaching runs help a lot when I am finding it difficult to get motivated and push myself. Awesome app, my only wish is that it would integrate the music controls with Spotify but maybe this is a function I am just not seeing. Overall, this is an amazing app.",5
1092,com.nike.plusgps,A lot of functions including option to set goals and respective training plan which I really like. Smooth and easy handling. Only a few Nike ads. There are other free apps where ads are really annoying but here it's just fine. Have tried various apps in this is my favorite.,5
1093,com.nike.plusgps,"I love the app for the most part. I find, however, that the distance calculator is not very accurate, in that it tends to undercount mileage at the clip of half a mile every three miles. If that could be fixed I would have zero complaints.",5
1094,com.nike.plusgps,"Love the guided runs! They give me running tips in real time and I can still listen to my music. Also provides me with the motivation to complete a run through words of encouragement, reminders on how far I've gone, and a nice lil countdown at the end. I ran consistently 4 years ago and this app got me back into running. Been going strong for 3 months because of NRC!! ‚ù§Ô∏è",5
1095,com.nike.plusgps,I've used this app for years and it's easy to use. I have a playlist attached to the app that I listen to when I run. I really enjoy the kudos at the end of the run from Kevin Hart. The only thing I would like to have the ability to add is a count down for the last 10 seconds along with the mile count down. currently you have to pick one or the other.,5
1096,com.nike.plusgps,It runs smooth and gives accurate distance amd times.It helps me stay on trake with my runs. It is really fun becaues of the achivments it is like a game and you can level up and that is what really pushes me to go forward. I have used multiple run apps and this one is better for me. I would recommend it especialy if you are just starting out. Last thing the 4 week plane is free which suprised me. You put is some info about you and it gives you a 4 week run plan for free No Cap.,5
1097,com.nike.plusgps,"BEST RUNNING APP EVER! Gives you guidance on your runs - if you want it, you can even listen to music! You pick from some great running plans to keep you on track with your goal, and he way this app tracks your runs PHENOMENAL! The app tracks your distance, adverage pace, time spent running, and shows you where you slowd down and sped up - and MORE. Worth a shot, and it even syncs with your Google Fit and Nike Training Club!",5
1098,com.nike.plusgps,"Using the half marathon training plan. Absolutely phenomenal. The guided runs are so much fun and engaging! Makes the mental effort so much easier to manage. I never really loved running although it was a part of every sport I played in highschool. This app and the guided runs made me literally love running. The emphasis on ""Easy"" runs was so key for me! I just finished my first 6.2mile run‚Äîthe farthest I've ever run! It felt amazing. Now just 10 weeks to go before my half marathonüôåüèª",5
1099,com.nike.plusgps,"Love it !! I use this app ALL the time. I have been able to increase my my distance and improve my pace. The only thing I don't like is that I have to choose between indoor/outdoor in settings. Or I just haven't found it on a run screen. I'd like to change it from the run screen, for when I forget to change it before I start my run.",5

1103,com.nike.plusgps,"I like this app because I believe it is improving my endurance. I like that the coaching is challenging, but not aggressive. I feel healthier after using this app for a run.",5
1104,com.nike.plusgps,Love this app..it can be guided and can play your music as well..i found a few friends on it and you can cheer them on as they run..very cool.. The only problem I've been having is if I use my watch to run it doesn't contribute my mileage to the challenges only to the club. Which defeats the purpose of being able to workout distraction free..so I always have to run with my phone in order to have my mileage added to my challenges..A bit frustrating üòë,5
1105,com.nike.plusgps,"Great app and best part it's free! The trainings, coaches and challenges are great and it connects to google fit. Only thing I wish for in future uodate is to be able to configure so we can show Pace and Miles in bigger font numbers on the main screen. It only shows time in big numbers which is great for race. But would be great to toggle to pace or miles shown in big readable fonts. UPDATE was able to install in pixel 2 watch, back to 5 stars. Best app for running.",5

It tells you it has your personal data up front and allows you to connect to an external apps. What it does not tell you when you provide it access to other apps is that it does not allow you use of that data without upgrading to premium.

The reason for the two star is that the use of FitnessPal use to be free for most things, but now they charge you premium in order to use some of those features. I used to be able to adjust macros, scan barcodes, and search foods fairly easy. Now, I have to purchase the ""premium"" in order to do that.

1466,com.myfitnesspal.android,I had used the app for quite some time and then stopped using it for about a year. I just started up again and the newer UI is really difficult to use. Not being able to disregard the banner about upgrading to premium which takes up the top third of my phone screen and the bottom navigation being curved takes up a significant amount of room on the bottom of my screen. The only usable space is the middle 1/3 of my phone and has made it almost unusable from a navigation standpoint.,2
1467,com.myfitnesspal.android,1. Everything is behind a pay wall. I mean hey make a good product and ask people to pay. But pretty much the whole app is a pay to really use. Just make it a one time payment of x dollars. Then you can have a subscription for the more personalized options. But to do anything you have to pay 80 a year or 20 a month. For the basics of no ads and use a barcode scanner. I'd pay 5 dollars for the app and the maybe that subscription for the app giving me a meal plan or access to the recipes.,2

The subscription is simply too expensive 80 USD per year is insane. What I noted 6 years ago is that integration with my Fitbit is poor and now I'm on Samsung gear and it's worse. Lower the one time price, fix the bugs, decrease ads for premium and you'd see a lot more in sales and higher reviews. I've been a user since inception in beta testing but I give up now.",2

1493,com.myfitnesspal.android,"What a shame, I lost 40 pounds a few years ago using this app. I come back, and now you have to pay to use the barcode scanner. As a developer, this indicates to me that they put profits over usability, which is not how it used to be and is really off-putting.

I don't mind the ads, but I really dislike the full screen go premium one. Update: After more use, the full screen adds have gone down to a minimum. I still don't like how much real estate they use trying to get you to go premium. Why not concentrate more on driving the cost of premium down so I can justify buying it?",3

The food library is also something that should be watched closely as there can be numerous listings for the same food or drink all with varying nutritional information.

1715,com.myfitnesspal.android,"Good app - beware subscription renewal. The app itself is good. Good database of food, good functionality. User friendly for the most part. The subscription service is my only issue. I've used MFP for years and done a few of the free trials. Each time I cancelled the subscription within days of starting the trial, and every single time wound up still getting charged for the subscription. Customer service is good enough and always refunds it, but it's shady that this happens so frequently.",3
1716,com.myfitnesspal.android,The app itself has been very helpful for me this year starting my weightloss journey. However the layout redesign from a few weeks ago is very unappealing to me. I dont feel like it's as user friendly/easy to navigate as it used to be. I will continue to use it but I wouldn't mind seeing a more streamlined layout. Especially navigating the weight progression. I do like the ability to add multiple foods at a time for meals.,3
1717,com.myfitnesspal.android,I use this app in conjuction with the Garmin app for the calorie tracker. I find it not very user friendly. Food is entered by serving size or cups etc with no option to do it by weight. I use a scale for all my food tracking so that i can be accurate. So now i have to use the fit bit app which does have a weight setting to determine how many calories and then go back in and adjust the serving size to match. Kinda a pain.,3
1718,com.myfitnesspal.android,"Super buggy. Doesn't sync to their family apps (MapMy___) at least a third of the time. Disconnecting and reconnecting their family apps resulted in errors. Barcode scanner errors out. Manually added recipes error out and won't save. It's really frustrating to use, but I think it's still the best option out there. I'm using the free version and would not give them money for premium based on how buggy it is. Hoping they can fix it because it has some great features!",3

1721,com.myfitnesspal.android,"I've been using MyFitnessPal, albeit inconsistently, since 2010. The app leaves much to be desired when it comes to finding ingredients for homemade meals. When you're a family that cooks from scratch often, it makes entering meals and saving recipes cumbersome throughout the day. It is nice for logging information, but I hate that some features which were previously free are now premium. I wish there was a simplified version of this app for people who cook from scratch often, and who do not track things like macros. In terms of weight loss it does help act as a deterrent from overeating, and it definitely helps me to troubleshoot my diet when I've fallen off the wagon.",3

However....... some of us fast, and to be told like a 5 year old that we 'won't get to see XX feature unless we eat' is a quite patronizing and extremely annoying.

Also, the app started to go blank at times which makes you have to close & reopen. The app then crashes and you have to open again. Annoying!!!",3
1724,com.myfitnesspal.android,"generally, it works ok and it's got a huge database of foods which is largely accurate, but still requires a good amount of need for the user to QA the data because while it's largely accurate, there are still plenty of incorrect entries. The site also experiences far too many issues where it throws up an error of ""too many users, try again some other time"", particularly in recipe creation (the most time-consuming aspect of the site). very frustrating to create a recipe and have it not save 20% of the time. Hard to recommend, but depends on what you need it for, it's not great, it's not bad. it does have several very handy features - upc scanning, recipe imports - but there is a ton of room for performance improvement.",3

I have not yet found it to link up with any music apps. And execises are able to log in but does not give an actual calorie burned count, unless you do have a device that is on the list to link with. Again pros and cons. But the food caloric intake is so far the best it also counts fat, cards, and proteins also know as Macros. That has helped me see food in a whole different way!",3

I'm giving 3 stars because now they have made some of the really good features apart of the premium plan like bar code scanner. That really sucks because at least that was just pure convenience and so much more accurate. Now without that you have to rely on if the nutritional info is already in correctly. Kinda sucks.,3

2015,com.myfitnesspal.android,"I've used this app on and off for more than 5 years. I love the way it has developed. It's a shame the scan function is now something you have to pay for through the premium accounts. Also, it doesn't give you the option to make special adjustments to your diet and calorie intake, specifically for breastfeeding moms (exclusive or partial). I simply add 300 calories in my head to the overall count.",4
2016,com.myfitnesspal.android,I have used this app several times over about a 8-year period. I use it as a food journal and also to log my exercise. So far I have only used the free version and yes someone else commented you used to be able to scan the barcodes of all the foods in the free version but I guess that's now part of the paid content. Anyway it's good I recommend it I use it it helps me exclamation point,4
2017,com.myfitnesspal.android,Its good enough to keep coming back to. Ive been using this app for about six years. Sometimes I stop dieting and uninstall it for space but I always reinstall it as soon as I get back to it. My only complaint us that it doesnt always sync correctly with samsung health. I wish it was just tracked my workouts and steps from my galexy watch instead of having to pull the data from samsung health.,4
2018,com.myfitnesspal.android,"The search feature leaves something to be desired. My Wife and I would type in the exact same words when searching for food. We would sometimes get something totally different. Other times the search would bring up items not even related to what we typed in. These two issues happened 30% or more of the time. Some items are listed as ""1 slice or piece"" with no reference to ""Oz or volume"". The calorie count would be of no value as 1 slice or piece could be 1 x 1 or 3 x 3. But the app was helpful.",4
2019,com.myfitnesspal.android,"Use this app everyday. Love it. Two Asks for the Developers: 1) On the ""Cardio"", the sort order doesn't work for most recent exercises. It's dated to some random sorting list. Been like this for years. 2) When searching for a food in ""Dinner"" (or any meal), it only searches foods in ""Dinner"". Could it do an exhaustive search first on ""Dinner"" and then the other three. Tried the ""log out"", and ""re-install"" quick fixes that sometimes work. Once both are fixed, I'll update to 5 stars!",4
2020,com.myfitnesspal.android,I wish the food diary was on the screen as soon as I open the app instead of having to look for the button. Also I often eat the same meal a few times a week and support showed me how to cut and paste the whole meal instead of having to log every single ingredient every time. Logging food daily is the main reason I stopped using similar apps but the shortcut they showed me saves me a ton of time.,4
2021,com.myfitnesspal.android,"really great app potential,... although some features are premium only,.. I do like that it calculates what you've burned according to weight, sets n reps and adds that to your calorie intake for the day, even though I don't count macro's except for protein, still very nice. overall I'd have to say, not perfect but definitely one of the better workout apps that I've found, good job guys.",4
2022,com.myfitnesspal.android,"Easy and convenient. I have put off tracking calories for so long thinking it would be a pain in my neck. However, getting serious about losing wt forced me to have to reconsider. This app makes me wish I had discovered it long ago. I like it. The free version is a great starting point for a beginner. Definitely "" my fitness pal.""",4
2023,com.myfitnesspal.android,"The app is decent. Ads are a little intrusive. I hate that they took away the barcode scanner from the free version and put it behind premium. If the premium (ad-free) version was cheaper than $80/year, I would buy. The price is a little steep for not much in return.",4
2024,com.myfitnesspal.android,"Good overall app for intake tracking. I kind of wish there was more customation with the dashboard. One example would be making it possible to add an intermittent fasting timer. It could be one of the added goals since everything else is there and would also probably get more people to use it, seeing how right now it's kind of hidden",4
2025,com.myfitnesspal.android,"I've used this app for a number of years and I have always liked it and found it pretty user friendly. First and foremost it helps you learn exactly what you are feeding your body and helps cut out mindless eating. Whatever your goals are this is a wonderful tool in making good food choices. I love being able to input my own recipes and getting the nutrition information! Unfortunately like all good things, the free version is slowly getting more and more restricted.",4
2026,com.myfitnesspal.android,"the free version really makes it painful with all the ads and pop ups. and the diary/dashboard separation is unintuitive. when I'm putting things in my diary, I'd like to see if I'm hitting my calorie and nutrition goals but I have to exit the diary go to the dashboard and back and forth.",4
2027,com.myfitnesspal.android,"While some of the foods aren't as extensive as I'd like, the ability to record and track how many calories are consumed per meal is a benefit. Not sure if there was a recent change to the water log (only currently limiting to the preset 8, 12, & 24 oz), but being able to track how much water I've consumed is helpful",4
2028,com.myfitnesspal.android,I like that you can link your device to track your exercise. I also like that I can find everything I eat in the app. I don't like that I can't use any form of measurement to log whatever I'm eating. I also don't like that you have to pay to scan the barcodes on the packages now. When I initially downloaded this app years ago it was free to scan the barcodes.,4
2029,com.myfitnesspal.android,"Great but for one thing. After logging my meal, it keeps popping up and saying I haven't logged it. I always check because I have forgot to click the check mark at the top of the page when I first started using the app but it's always showing that it's logged when I look. Also, it says it's connected with my Samsung health and smart watch but doesn't log any of my steps.",4
2030,com.myfitnesspal.android,"I used this almost 10 years ago and it really helped. I decided to try it out again but found the scanner isn't free anymore and you have to pay a whole lot just to have that and other features. Rather disappointed but it's still a decent app. If you really like the scan option, there are other free apps",4
2031,com.myfitnesspal.android,"It's an alright app. It'd be nice if there was a setting to remove calorie counting, and keep the nutrients/macro percentage count. Especially as someone who has struggled with excessive unhealthy calorie counting in the past (with this app as well), I'm trying to use this app to track protein and promote strength growth/healthy eating habits. But, I know I can just set a goal to EAT that many calories, but that still feeds into obsessing over calories eaten. So just an idea to make it optional!",4
2032,com.myfitnesspal.android,I love that this app has almost every food you can think of. My husband and I downloaded it to watch our calories and it does it perfectly! I do wish it connected to my watch but I downloaded Google fit and it works great. If anything I wish I didn't always have to open it in order for it to update my steps but other than that it's super helpful and tracks so much valuable information just stick with it. There is also a whole community that you can access without the paid membership.,4
2033,com.myfitnesspal.android,"I love this app, and it's helped me to go from 340 to 180 pounds, go off all my meds, and feel a heck of a lot better. 5 stars for the phone app. 3 stars for the tablet, though. It defaults to portrait mode (I use it in landscape with an attached keyboard for easier typing). And for those screens available in landscape, you can view info on food, but you can't edit it without going to portrait. I would love to see this remedied in future versions.",4
2034,com.myfitnesspal.android,"Actually seeing results by tracking food intake and physical activities over the last 2 yrs. I've lost a total of 20lbs, yay!! I love the breakdown of nutrients consumed each day, you really become aware of just how much you are missing and overtaking allowing you to readjust so you can get those vital nutrients. Although scanning of barcode of food was taking away, that puts a damper on tracking efficiently. Please bring that back without having to go premium.",4

I would very much like it to be an option. What would also be cool is if we could place photos next to our meal diary. That way we look back and have a clear understanding on how much we need to eat to reach our goals. I know many people to be visual learners, and this will help set healthy expectations/experiences for your customers. Great app‚ù§",4

However, by the end of the night the step counter is usually several thousand off compared to what both Samsung Health and Google Fit show when connected to Health Connect. Also, the inability to automatically pull in workouts, body weight and measurement from Health Connect is disappointing. Lastly, the layout on the main display on the Galaxy Fold5 needs some work, everything is scaled so big a lot of scrolling is needed.",4

Since I am on a tight budget and sporadic in my tracking, I can't justify subscribing to premium features. There were a few available when I first downloaded the app years ago that I miss now. Still, I'm glad to see basics tracked over significant time. TYVM MFP!",4
2038,com.myfitnesspal.android,"Pretty good for tracking daily consumption. Takes a while to get the hang of searching up foods and constructing meals but once you get over that it's pretty efficient. The ads are borderline intrusive but tolerable. I like how well it integrates with its sister exercise apps like ""map-my-run(walk,ride)"" so you can earn a snack or two.",4
2039,com.myfitnesspal.android,"I have been using this app for 4 years. Overall, it's reliable, but like this week, it has been so Clichy adding food I didn't add. It also is saying I need to lower my fat macros even though I didn't change the grams I'm consuming. It's very frustrating when you are trying to be as accurate as possible for a cut. It makes it very confusing.",4

I enter food almost every day. At times, I have a cheat day, but again, I am aware! ü§óüíñ I recommend this to many. I do the free one. So very afforda",4
2041,com.myfitnesspal.android,"It's good for logging food intake, but there are problems. First, it assumes everyone is trying to lose weight and only gives tips on weight loss. When I complete my daily diary, it tells me how much weight I'll lose at this rate, but I'm on a muscle gain diet so it isn't accurate. Also, in the diary, it often says, ""This food has ___ grams of carbohydrates. Your goal is to stay under ___ grams."" However, my goal is to get AT LEAST that many carbs, not less. Good overall, but not very inclusive.",4
2042,com.myfitnesspal.android,"it's great! it helps a lot. The only thing us that you kinda have to log in to everything and search for everything to get more accurate results.

2043,com.myfitnesspal.android,"A very useful and helpful app to keep track of calories and other diet components (carbs, fats, proteins, sugars, etc.) I especially like and appreciate the gentle but persistent nagging to enter meals, as well as the periodic reminders on daily diet component targets. The only shortcoming I have found is that -sometimes - the food statistics (even those with a green check box, which is supposed to mean the entries have been checked and verified. don't always align with the information shown on the actual food packaging. Differences are not huge, but one of the two has to be wrong.",4
2044,com.myfitnesspal.android,It can become tedious when you are loading one item at a time in the food diary. A check off box next to items selected would save me a lot of time. Recently used foods is saved which is good but not in alphabetical order so you have to go through the whole list to find the apple. But then its free!Perhaps when you pay none of this is an issue. Having problems connecting my Alta fitbit but again this may only work if purchased. Bar coding is great!! I Love it like to see some improvements! Thanks.,4
2045,com.myfitnesspal.android,"The database of foods is astonishing, and the functionality makes tracking food, weight, water, and exercise easy. With it, I was able to lose about 35 lbs in about six months, simply through rigorous tracking. I take a star off for two reasons. The first is for some bugs, including not being able to get input from my pedometer app (which is claimed to be supported and worked initially, but ceased and cannot be reestablished). The second reason is the incessant marketing. Near daily advertising for UA products gets a bit annoying. I might be more receptive if it wasn't so frequent. But it's basic human biology that the body and mind eventually drown out constant stimuli.",4
2046,com.myfitnesspal.android,"Great for what it is, a calorie counter and a step towards healthier living. I like that you can connect and sync other apps to it to make your life easier, but I think it's about time to update the list of apps that you can connect and sync with. For ex., in my opinion, I think there are better options to use besides the Glow app for logging/syncing feminine health info, since it seems Glow seems to have gone downhill since the partnership and I think it's time you found a new partnership. :)",4
2047,com.myfitnesspal.android,I enjoyed this app overall. It was great to track calories and had a good variety of ways to add in the food. (I luv the barcode scanner) I was trying to gain weight and it did help me accomplish quite a bit! Only complaint from me? I would reach my calorie intake goals and for some reason it kept deleting the food I put in and would remind me I didn't log certain meals. (Which I did) Overall pretty great app for free! Just needs a little work with the bugs.,4
2048,com.myfitnesspal.android,"This app has the potential to be great. I like everything about it except syncing with Fitbit is way to finicky. Having to repair the connection should be rare, but it's often and cumbersome. A second pay tier would be recommended also. I don't want the things, mostly, offered in premium. But I would pay something less than premium for a more reliable Fitbit connection. A few bucks a month maybe.",4
2049,com.myfitnesspal.android,"It's been a good ap overall. I wish they had more options for food and drinks, some things don't show. I scanned a barcode on my lemonade and it doesn't show up. I've scanned it multiple times. We should be able to give our own amount of servings and measurements as well. There needs to be an option for desserts. If we choose to eat dessert, we should have somewhere to put it instead of snacks. And I wish the app would give us the amount of calories a day and speedometer to track our steps.",4

I work out a lot and I find logging my exercise exasperating. Without premium, it's just a basic calorie counter, which does work if that's all you want. I'm going to continue using it until I find something that suits me better. Edit: Following the update logging exercise seems easier.",4

2061,com.myfitnesspal.android,This app is great for using to simply count your calories and to keep track of any weight or body measurements over time. The barcode scanner is a super convenient feature for logging calories. The only complaints I can think of are the fact that logging calories for restaurants is difficult and most of the time the calories given are incorrect. My other complaint is that it is difficult to log exercise when you are using professional workout programs. My Fitness Pal does not include these.,4

Its easy to use and I like the running feed of recipes and personal fitness posts. A couple things I wish it had is a wider variety of exercise options or the ability to add my own paces, and the ability to see the recipe ingredients detailed out for the calorie counts. Like, I had a slice of white pizza last night. The calories for the different white pizza choices have a really wide variety..or for Swiss chard soup....does that recipe have cheese in it?, or does that Mediterranean vegetables include olives? ....see my dilemma? And sometimes the pace I run or walk is not listed. I also wish I could set the default of the homepage to my diary. Anyway, those are fairly minor for all it offers. It gets me in the ballpark for tracking my calories, and overall I'm grateful for the ease of use, the sleek look and feel, and the nutrition assessment of fats, protiens, carbs and other minerals I get even beyond the calorie count. It's a powerful little app!",4

2081,com.myfitnesspal.android,"I'm using this primarily as a food diary and it works well for that. Scanning barcodes makes it much easier to describe meals I put together for myself. It does connect with my fitness trackers but I don't use it for tracking that. The one complaint I have is that it routinely puts up notifications that I have not entered food when I plainly have Donfor a given block of the day. (6-9 am, or 9-12, for example. This happens when I enter only one food item for a block of time",4
2082,com.myfitnesspal.android,The app itself is good. The problem is that I never got a 30 day free trial as promised. It took my money immediately and now the app store cancelled but they aren't giving my money back. What happened to my free 30 day trial?? Update; The app is great and deserves more stars. The service team was quick to fix my issue. Although I would still consider paying for premium after a 30 day free trial. It's a good price at the discounted rate. I feel the app can help many people shed unhealthy weight.,4
2083,com.myfitnesspal.android,I like everything about the free ap. I like that you can change the diet you are on and the ap will adjust with you. All your goals can be adjusted but it does allow for healthy limits. The only issues I've had is some of the measurements in the food list are off or the calories don't match the packaging. And every so often the ap freezes or multiplies the food item while I'm entering it.,4
2084,com.myfitnesspal.android,"The free portion of this app does exactly what I was looking for. The only problem I have found is, I have trouble looking up exactly what I've eaten especially if it is homemade. Also I do not like how some of the measurements are listed. I feel like I need to purchase a food scale in order to find the correct grams/ounces. I wish most of the options were given in measurements of cups or tablespoons so it would be easier to guesstimate. However I love how my garmin has the capability to connect",4
2085,com.myfitnesspal.android,"Enjoying how easy it is to log food. Allows you to sort past entries, including alphabetically or chronologically. Can also input an entire recipe, mark the number of servings, and it calculates the numbers of macronutrients and calories for you (plus saved for future use.) I wish it would track with my Fitbit steps and other tracking, though.",4
2086,com.myfitnesspal.android,"Currently using the free version. Great at allowing you to calculate # of calories per item / meal. Like that you can separate items by ""meal"". Ie: break, lunch, dinner, snack. Great that it remembers previous items and allows you to organize based on frequency or alphabetically. Also connects to Fitbit to keep track of exercise & calories burned. Would consider upgrading to the paid version to remove the ad banners. Also so you can toggle off the increase allotted calories when working out.",4
2087,com.myfitnesspal.android,"I like that this app is quick to find about any food that I search. It even includes restaurant foods, and has a barcode scanner. It has been great with helping me keep up with my calorie count, you can even apply exercise and it adjusts accordingly. All with the free version. I will say, I had to turn off the notifications, it reminds you at weird times that you haven't logged a meal....And, sometimes I want to tell it,""you aren't the boss of me!""",4
2088,com.myfitnesspal.android,"I think MyFitnessPal does a good job of organizing information in a very presentable way. My primary goal in downloading the app was to make sure I was eating enough (I wasn't!). The app both gives me a way to quantify how much I've eaten vs. should eat as well as pesters me to eat. The one complaint, which I consider quite serious, so is why I've knocked off one star, is that every time you mark a day complete it gives you a comment ""if you are like this every day, in 5 weeks you would weigh X"". Since I neither want to lose nor gain weight, and I selected that when setting up the app, this just makes me feel bad unless I exactly nail the calorie goal.",4
2089,com.myfitnesspal.android,"Great app. Easy to link to Google Fit, and I find myself going to this app way more than I thought I would, even if just to see my step count throughout the day. I only wish there were a way to log other non ""exercise"" activities like pressure washing, for example. Some can certainly be a workout. Also, the fact that weightlifting doesn't calculate calories burned is kind of ridiculous. There's no way that information isn't out there. Maybe those are premium version features?",4
2090,com.myfitnesspal.android,"Great app, very good for tracking calorie intake / weight. Only problem I've found which could be major for some, is it has an issue with how it saves images. Images of foods I've put into the app with transfer into my progression photos, and the other way around. What's even weirder is I am unable to delete these images. Hoping that gets fixed soon.",4
2091,com.myfitnesspal.android,"This app is very useful and I appreciate having it. It helps to keep me on track with my goals, and is super convenient for the most part. It a little buggy, and it frustrates me sometimes that it just randomly stops working, and won't save recipes or meals. It's also frustrating that incorrect data is rampant in the barcode scans and searches. But overall, it's a great app if you want to track calories and macros.",4
2092,com.myfitnesspal.android,"Been using this app daily for probably 6 plus years. Its been great, but they couldnt leave it alone. Its already going down hill with the last update. At $50 something dollars a year, leave it alone. Now along with a change in functionality and feel (which sucks for those of us long term users, and it went from the look and feel of a professional app to an app that feels like it was a free app beta version for kids), it stopped working completely tonight. You had perfection.. bring it back",4
2093,com.myfitnesspal.android,"App is great. It has a great database of foods, drinks to choose. It helps me with my daily intake. 2 things. It does send reminders that I didn't enter whatever meal I had, even though I did. Minor annoyance. But I do wish they had a vitamin section. I just put my daily regimen in the snacks. And I wish that we could group select items to add, instead of browsing through the list. It has a history, so if you consume something, you can add it easily. Minor nitpicking.",4
2094,com.myfitnesspal.android,"Once saw a flash where could upload entire meals or dishes prepared and eaten together but don't know where to find that again. Similarly, would olive to be able you upload classes under exercise like zumba, yoga, chisel and core etc. Could create a typical program and enter duration. Overall, an instruction page, index or more elaborate menu(s) would be good. Impressed though with the range of foods included, scan option and space for notes.",4
2095,com.myfitnesspal.android,"I haved used this app for many years as a daily diary. It does a what I need to track my calories and runs. My dissatisfaction is their monthly cost for premium. If it were $6-7 monthly like most subscriptions, I would support the application. But instead they want a subscription fee on par with Office 365 or Adobe cloud, so I'm constantly looking for another application.",4
2096,com.myfitnesspal.android,"This has almost everything! The two things I'd love to have is: 1. Capability to see my net carbs for each individual meal and total day nutrition view. 2. I'd like to have the option to see something other than calories. Example, I'd like to see macros plus net carbs vs. macros and calories. Other than that, wow! I love being able to scan my foods with UPC codes! The scan option has found all but one food which I was able to add. Any restaurants that don't have the menu I'm able to find online",4
2097,com.myfitnesspal.android,"I love this app. It has been life-changing to have such a convenient way to track the foods I eat and how they align with my nutritional goals. Using the web interface I can readily search foods I've eaten in the year and a half since I first downloaded. This release crashes occasionally on my phone, and there are still issues with routing. For example, I'll log dinner for yesterday, and the app returns me to the screen for today. Overall, though, it's awesome.",4
2098,com.myfitnesspal.android,"I've alway had success losing weight with this app. I've never puchased the premium package, yet have lost weight. Goals can be asjusted as you go. So if you've got a long ways to go you can start with a small reachable goal, once you've met that one, you can change them as you need. My only cratique is occasionally, the scan will freeze but I've wondered if that was due to poor internet. its a great tool! Good luck to all looking to reach weight loss goals! you can do it!",4
2099,com.myfitnesspal.android,"This is my first fitness app. It is awesome for tracking my carbs . App is somewhat user friendly. I still wander around to find what I want. An improvement would be to show what foods contain sugar in my daily diet. It is challenging to identify the actual food I ate. often by default, I input the incorrect food and my stats are then slightly incorrect. Then I hunt for what is incorrect. I continue to learn how to use this app and look forward to downloading reports. I would recommend this app.",4
2100,com.myfitnesspal.android,Used to be 5 stars but some features are now premium only.,4
2101,com.myfitnesspal.android,I like it... I can really see how this is gonna help me accomplish my weight loss goals. I just wish it didn't cost so much monthly & yearly. I'll wait for a sale before buying the premium version so I can access more features and get rid of the many ads.,4

It just disappears and I have to search and enter it again. Second, there needs to be a way to share food with other users. If my wife and I eat the same thing she asks me what I entered it as. It would be so much easier just to share it.",4
2105,com.myfitnesspal.android,Does what I need it to do but keeping g KY garmin watch connected is not easy.,4
2106,com.myfitnesspal.android,Easy to use especially the barcode scanner. Love the historical data. Still haven't got to grips with recipe function. Wish the default was grams for the UK.,4

2114,com.myfitnesspal.android,I like using this app its great for tracking my calories but it seems to have a rather strange thing happening with the excercise section of the diary. I have it linked to my Samsung account and it frequently duplicates the events giving me false data.,4

2120,com.myfitnesspal.android,I hope the nutritional stats they provide are accurate,4
2121,com.myfitnesspal.android,The app has helped keep me on track for years. You absolutely CANNOT make changes to your weight unless you know what you're consuming! My annoyance with the app right now is that it doesn't distinguish between natural and added sugars. I eat a lot of fruit. I'm not worried about natural sugar; it's the added that's poison and that I want to track. Any plans for that??,4
2122,com.myfitnesspal.android,Enjoying the app but Fitbit Versa 2 won't sync,4
2123,com.myfitnesspal.android,would be nice to input condiments or input a custom meal but overall good,4

2126,com.myfitnesspal.android,Helps keep me on track,4
2127,com.myfitnesspal.android,Great app. Love the plans. A real improvement would be to be able to adjust the water goal and be able to easily share created recipes with buddies. It would also be good to be able to duplicate something from one day to add it more easily to other days or meal times.,4
2128,com.myfitnesspal.android,"I use this app to count calories and types of intakes. It also tracks amount of calories burned exercise, but not very much on types. It is good for me for my needs on counting calories in and out, and tracking nutrients.",4

2134,com.myfitnesspal.android,"Overall, it's a decent app. However, the database needs some time spent on it to remove duplicated and incorrect entries. It also lacks some more basic things like customisable filtering options and display, better UI, etc. I see a lot of simple requests being put forward by users in the official forums, but no action. Given what we pay for the subscription, I would rather more resources are allocated to general improvements than adding new features that most don't use.",4
2135,com.myfitnesspal.android,"Overall a great program though the sync with Fitbit is a little wonky with duplicate exercises. I log exercises only in Fitbit using my Sense, but MFP keeps creating its own version which then syncs back to Fitbit causing dupes. Relying on Health Connect only to sync between the two did away with the dupes, but then my nutrition data wasn't going to Fitbit. Not sure if this is the fault of Fitbit or MFP, so I'm back to the direct MFP/Fitbit sync & duplicate exercises for now.",4
2136,com.myfitnesspal.android,Great app,4
2137,com.myfitnesspal.android,App got a bit buggy but uninstalled it and reinstalled it and its working perfect again. Great way for tracking calorie intake or macros.

Very annoying as don't always have the barcode close by.,4

Highly recommend a yearly subscription if you're serious about your fitness goals, but struggle with tracking your calorie or macro intake.",5

It counts it all on an individual scale based on the user's weight loss goal and matches it against the daily recommended allowance. It also monitors your connected step counter and other exercise on a daily basis. It's a fantastic way to lose weight on a minimal budget. The app is worth the $19.99 monthly fee!",5

It's a lot harder than I would have guessed. Sometimes the nutrition information can be off, but I guess that's to be expected with a crowdsourced app. Still I can usually search a little harder and find a food item with nutrition information that makes more sense. Overall the app is great for an information and problem solving junkie like me.",5

Another calorie counting app I've tried kept many items locked and wouldn't log them or show their data unless you used the paid version. This app does have a paid version but it appears to offer a ton more options and the calorie counting feature is not throttled at all in the free version.,5

Their app constantly glitched and was not user friendly.  Moreover, their program uses Points which force their members to learn/buy brand specific tools all unique to WW rather than using a straight forward calorie count.  With the Calorie Counter - MyFitnessPal app, I can easily maneuver through the different options and quickly log my meals and water consumption.  I can connect with a community that offers a very large variety of supportive articles and tools and, at the same time, it's easy to understand the comments because they aren't ""branded"".  Even better, I can link my fitbit and MapMyWalk apps and see all my data in one place.  A big thank you and huge thumbs up to Under Armour.",5

If they incorporated that it'd be truly perfect. It's not enough of a gripe to lose a star though; it's still a 5 star app.",5

My only problem is the exstimate of maximum calories it sets for me only works in winter. In the summer, even with regular outdoor walking (which I can't do in winter), I have to consume 120 fewer calories than the app's limit to maintain my weight. I would like it if this app considered the fact that people burn calories differently depending upon the season. Thanks!",5

I especially like that it figures my exercise into the calories I have left to consume so it both encourages me to work out more and gives me the opportunity to eat more based on the extra calories I burn. I love it. I'm currently using the free version, but now that I've had some time to learn the system, I'm considering paying for the premium version. Thanks, Carlleen (ckbmovesmore), for the recommendation!",5

The food values are usually spot on when you know the brand, and if you find an error it is easy to fix. It's difficult with restaurant foods that aren't in the app bc the options are so varied.

When I do a long run outside in the summer, I need more sodium to keep my electrolytes in balance, but the app doesn't take this into account. I've also found that if I eat the extra calories the app gives me for steps I gain weight instead of losing weight, so it appears the number of calories for steps is overstated. Bottom line it's a great app!",5

2274,com.myfitnesspal.android,"The premium version doesn't have anything that I would pay anything for, but to each their own. The experience of using the app is smooth and close to flawless. The catalog of barcodes is impressive, competitors do not have Lidl products, for example. This may not mean much to everyone but when Lidl opens 5 stores in your area and you start shopping there it is a definite perk. I can imagine others have had the same experience with their own local experiences. I don't use calorie counters much past 5 weeks, I use them to retrain my understanding of what I am consuming and then wing it for a few months. Keeping the tracking going forever isn't feasible for me, but having this as an option means I will come back and not try another one out the next time I need one.",5
2275,com.myfitnesspal.android,"Its great. There are incentives to use the paid version, and if you do, it's more customizable. I have the free version and because I'm a fitness pro and I'm familiar with what I need and this helps me keep track. Otherwise, I would have to put in a lot more work with meal prep (which would still work well as my usage increases and I program recipes). This app will be a good eye opener for beginners who want to watch lore carefully over micrnutoents and macronutrients.",5
2276,com.myfitnesspal.android,"I love this app! It has really helped me keep my focus strong while beginning my keto journey. I routinely log everything I eat and it keeps track of it all so I know what I can and cannot have. Logging meals is so simple, you can even scan barcodes to search items. My favorite feature is the ability to ""create"" your own recipes. This allows you to save regular meals and then quickly add them to your food diary.",5
2277,com.myfitnesspal.android,"Wow. I can't believe this has so much for free. I've lost five pounds just sticking to the calorie count and sodium count. Ads are very few and almost always let you immediately exit them. You can track your weight, set goals, and more. You can find almost any food! I found McDonalds menu items from Saudi Arabia on this app! The camera scanner lets you instantly input any food item with a barcode, too, so you don't have to search. Very nice app! Would definitely subscribe if I had the money.",5
2278,com.myfitnesspal.android,"Finds off-the-wall foods and can change serving size and number of servings. Able to view individual foods' nutrients by simply using an empty meal or go to tomorrow. Having to enter EVERYTHING makes me very aware of the quantities I was, and am, consuming. Too early to rate weight tracking convenience. At least all info is in one place, which is convenient.",5
2279,com.myfitnesspal.android,"I've only been using the app for a few days but so far it seems to be helping a lot with portion control and calorie counting, as well as helping me track things like protein, sugar, and carb consumption... definitely would recommend (although, full disclosure, I'm only using the free version so can't speak to the value of the paid features).",5
2280,com.myfitnesspal.android,"I only had two issues using this app. 1. Sometimes scans barcodes too quickly, and I can't get it in clear view in time so the app doesn't recognise it. I occasionally have to scan a few times. This is a minor issue that doesn't really bother me. 2. It has trouble syncing with Google Fit, so I switched to Samsung Health, and it works well, so that might not be an issue with this app. Fantastic app that has been a game changer in my life, and that is just with the free version.",5

I think the water counter is most important. I've reinstalled MyFitness app for a 2nd time and noticed all the changes. I've browsed the recipes (even made a few), and have lost weight already. I will continue to follow the app daily. GREAT APP!!! I don't think that I would pay for the extra features though.",5
2282,com.myfitnesspal.android,"I can't thank the makers of this app enough. Sometimes thinhs can be a little glitchy, but it does what it says it does and it works. Without this tool (over the years!), I don't think I would have been able to as accurately track my calorie intake to reach not only weight goals, but health and wellness. The people who keep this running should be proud of themselves for all the people they've helped to help themselves.",5
2283,com.myfitnesspal.android,This is a great app and I'm using the free version which is ample for what I need. It gives you sufficient information to track calories which is all I really need.

2284,com.myfitnesspal.android,"I usually just use fitbit app to track and log everything. As I'm getting used to this app and finding hidden features, I'm becoming more impressed. I appreciate the information sharing between myFitnessPal and fitbit - that makes things a lot easier to manage instead of having to double up on logging info. I love that in the weight log, I can also upload a progress pic! I do wish there were separate slots for am / pm snacks and dessert. The apps widget is a handy feature, too. Great app üëå",5
2285,com.myfitnesspal.android,"i have been using this app every time i am trying to lose weight. the feature that I like is that it connects with my garmin, so every time I do an exercise, it detects the amount of calories that I burn. I can also input the food I eat, which tracks the calorie intake. by monitoring the calorie deficit is the key to weight loss. thank you MFP.",5
2286,com.myfitnesspal.android,"Great app with lots of free features as well as extras that can be purchased via monthly subscription or a discount annual fee. The app can log meals as individual items, great if you'v home made and for accuracy, or you could just add a set meal, e.g fajitas, you can load your own recipe,which you can add quickly. You can add water intake. Link to apps like Google fit so that it logs you steps, exercise, states calories burnt. Groups, recipes Had loads more to say but word count, give it a go",5

Some pushups are not even scaled, like hover-pushups. Edit: seems the devs didn't understand/read/care, the problem is volume not variety. Too many pushups for a 'beginner'. Read or shut it.",1

Pretty sad considering the overrating this app has been given on playstore.,1
2459,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,I would give 5 stars but having to press done each time and with no time limits to finish each workout is a no good.

It's normally a solid 4/5 but please, if you have to force us to watch unstoppable minute long ads, put it at the end of the workout, not the beginning.

2601,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"The app itself is good and runs smooth... HOWEVER. The workouts in this system need to have better customization. Where you can select which muscle groups are more advance and which ones need work or are not as advanced. Because of the lack of that feature, some things will be way to easy and if you increase it. It'll make some things WAY to advanced and more inclined to injury. Finally there are workouts in here that are just not safe to do at all not without a actual in person instructor.",2
2602,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"This app is alright for what it needs to do. The workouts fit the difficulty, but only to an extent. If you press the 'that was too easy' button after a workout, it doesn't always give you harder workouts next time, but just makes you do the same ones over and over. Hyperextension, for example, should be skipped. One day I had to do this for 4 sets of 14 (too many for a back workout in one day). The day after, I was in so much pain I could barely move my back without feeling immense pain Be safe",2
2603,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Mostly good. Not really full body. Just had a workout with 7 different pushups and a stretch at the end. Not really ""switching it up"".

2609,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"My main purpose for getting this app was to have a workout plan. Unfortunately, the app only offers 2 different scheduled plans. Once you have done those, you are left with a bunch of workouts that it is up to you to figure out how to schedule, which is no different at that point then just looking up exercises for free online. You are paying for about 2 months of useful plans, then the app becomes obsolete as you are on your own. Bummer.",2

2612,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,It's difficult to know as a beginner for how many days One should continue the beginner's work out and then move onto the intermediate and advanced. Would be great if u could help me out in this one.,2
2613,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,There's just one reason behind giving only two stars to the app. I am currently doing full body exercise. I started using the app about two months ago. I excercise daily. But the only problem is that my muscles aren't still visible properly. What is the problem?,2
2614,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"The app itself is actually very useful, easy to use and the different workouts are good. In 6 weeks I've lost nearly a stone, but I wasn't really aiming to lose just tone so that's great news for me. Now the bad bits, the workouts are not labelled very well. The ""Full Body"" workout just does upper body exercises with nothing below the waist, but you then have a leg focused work out, so rename the full body to upper body to make it known what it focuses. I'd add more, but have no room.",2
2615,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"This would be good software if one could purchase it instead of having to pay recurring subscription fees ad infinitum. The human anatomy does not change over the years, neither does training gear, and when one takes a minute to think about it, all a fitness app really does is to vary the sequence of exercises and repetitions a little bit. For an antivirus or firewall, a subscription might be justified, but not for this. Replaced with superior alternatives that can be bought instead of rented.",2
2616,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,I like the app but some moves are hard to make out from the minimalist depictions and what's really annoying is that after every single workout it submits the last weight I entered to Google Fit. It should only do that when I actually enter an updated weight. Edit: I had to reset my device and _nothing_ was saved. Have to start all over. That's unacceptable.,2
2617,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Hey guys I wrote a review which you responded to Appreciate that, but I think you misunderstood my experience I love your app I was using it every day for a couple weeks with great results! I totally understand your need to display ads That doesn't bother me at all!

2620,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"After paying to remove the ads and to be able to discover new workouts for free, they rolled out an update that introduced hardly anything else but a monthly subscription that does the very same things but without ever giving out a refund. The app would be great otherwise, as the 28day challenge coupled with macro managing has really helped me to start getting into shape, but trust me when I say that these developers don‚Äôt deserve your money.",2
2621,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Great workouts, but terrible app. Unable to import stats from Lose Weight in 30 Days app and unable to create my own workout routine like in the Lose Weight app. It's as if you're trying to make us keep both, which I don't want to do. I would even consider it if the workout stats synced between the two, which they do not. Just put it all in one app. It doesn't need to be this difficult. It actually demotivates me to work out because it isn't as easy as when I just had the Lose Weight app.",2
2622,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"It has a decent predefined set list. It integrates with Google Fit. Exercises are done using your own body, and it lacks exercises using weights like dumbbells. It also doesn't allow you do create a personalized workout set, except choosing the already defined ones, at least I didn't find a way to do so.    Because of the lack of weights, and basically no customization, it's not for me.",2
2623,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Really want to give more stars here.. the app does come with very nice quality of life features and is easy to navigate/setup. However Ive had trouble with 1.) The notification setting, not reminding me even though I have set two alarms and enabled all permissions. 2.) The lack of variety on the 7x4 full body workout. It only focuses on chest and core. No back, no shoulders, no arms. The lower body is completely separate and is not a part of the full body(?) Workout. Overall 2/5.",2
2624,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Would be a good app but it's not giving enough options for the workout. E.g. I want to do 2 sets and a maximum of 30 min. But if you want a harder training it just adds another set and more exercise making the training longer. I don't have time for that though! Also only in the 30 days plan it includes weights. I want to do much more weight training and increase the weight if I feel like it. If they would fix that, it would be a great app.",2
2625,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Don't waste your time unless you know how to perform every exercise already. The app demonstrates each exercise with an animated illustration, but they are not very good and you can't see what is going on in most. The second option is to watch a real life video of the exercise, but all the developers do is link to a random YouTube video so it's luck of the draw... Sometimes you get a decent video but again most of the time it's random and you have to watch someone promoting their channel before",2
2626,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Really not a useful app. It will not understand that you find a specific excercise feature difficult, and instead of removing that specific feature or simplifying it, it makes the ENTIRE training session easier. You end up having to skip the parts that cause you immense pain, and barely breaking a sweat on the bits you can do. Seriously? 6 heel touches? That isn't a workout.",2
2627,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"It is good but the whole body program needs to be changed back to the way it was , choosing beginner, intermediate or experienced levels .. i just restarted the program but was on a way to high level to start with , without being able to choose this program is going to hurt a lot of people and give the makers a lot of trouble in lawsuits",2
2628,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Wouldn't recommend. Plans are weirdly unabalanced. I picked a full body one and it ranged from impossible for me to complete (pushup sections) to really easy (weird arm workouts). Adjusting up and down affected everything equally, no fine tuning. Also ads are really irritating and don't remember sound settings (if I mute the app, it means I don't want to hear a peep out of you). Uninstalled, on the hunt for better.",2
2629,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"The workout routines are great. The app, not so much. There's no skip day, even though you are asked to set one, it never comes up. You can't customize, I have a dedicated abs routine, so would like to replace abs day on this app, with lower body, but no real way to do that.",2
2630,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Please make a app for resistance band workout also with all features like in this app. Like different body parts workout with different levels like beginners, intermidiate, advanced, . Also make a app for hand gripper also please. Thank You.",2
2631,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,I have the app on my phone. I have also installed it on a watch - Huawei Watch GT 4. But the two apps are not connected. Data is not synced with Huawei Health. I don't see the point of this app in the watch. Otherwise the phone app is great and I use it every day.,2
2632,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,No progress in the app! Working out more than a week but it shows to start from day one. The calender is showing i have finished 7 days but the workout section doesnt. The discover section doesnt download any new workout. The first plan was nice. But i think this app has bugs. No progress is recording. Same exercises over and over. Discover section doesnt download new exercise.,2
2633,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Enjoying the workouts, but got a new phone (Galaxy S10 plus) and can't find any way to save and/or transfer my progress and data over to the new device (tried using Samsung smart switch, but to no avail). The app forces me to begin at day 1, and there's no point. Totally demotivated from using the app now.",2
2634,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"No back exercises! Also no way to target a specific part of the body and see exercises specific to that muscle group. Overall a very poor implementation of a good idea. The interface is confusing and doesn't k ow what it wants to present, workout plans or targeted areas, it ends up doing neither well. I'll just search pinterest for specific exercises instead.",2
2635,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,I think your old version is good because we do exercise with equipment and with equipment it's our choice Please you use also equipment version,2
2636,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Seriously, it only ever offers me push ups! If I wanted a push-up app I'd download a push-up app. Where are all the other home-workout exercises?!?!?",2
2637,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,I was greeted with a few questions asking about my preferences which was really cool. Until I actually got into the exercise and realised that the app ignored almost all of them. I selected 3 of the 4 body areas to work out and said I was at a beginner leveland my suggested workout was very hard on my arms (I couldnt complete the exercise for this reason) and I don't feel like the other areas were worked out at all.,2
2638,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"This app did help me get in better shape but after doing the full body 7x4 challenge I couldn't help but feel lost and didn't know what excersises to do after that. The other excersise routines that werent challenges didn't feel like I was making progress anymore, I either felt nothing or slight pain. I wish the challenges were longer, until then, I don't really know how to work out.",2
2639,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"not upto the mark. my full body 28 day work-out challenge didn't have any significant impact. also, i've been doing exercises to reduce belly fat and they're not giving any impact too. would be great if you people also suggest the rest period for certain exercises",2
2640,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"This app is neither bad nor good. When it asks me about a particular exercise and I say I can't do it due to injury I'm told ""Ok, its gone."" only to see it return two days later. Dammit when my back says not to do it then please listen to me app. Would have had a higher star count but not listening to me demotes your app.",2
2641,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Good for beginner level, but the difference between beginners and intermediate level is massive. Also the feedback system on how hard or easy an exercise is does absolutely nothing",2
2642,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Ridiculous skill levels. The 'beginner' push up level where you can claim to do '3-5 push ups in one exercise' left me on week 2 day 1 doing 12 push ups with rotations as a single exercise in a 12 exercise workout. I'm young and already fairly fit, however for anyone who wants to get in shape using this app the easiest skill level is near impossible to achieve. The developers need to add at least 2 lower levels from their current difficulty adjustments.",2
2643,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Whenever I switch apps while taking a break and then get back to continuing my workout on this app, it does not save my progress. It goes back to the first exercise as if I haven't done it yet. üòí Edit: Here are the details. I was halfway through completing the 12 workouts. I decided to take a break and took pics on my Camera app. After around 10 minutes, I switched back to your app. There was a brief loading with a blank white screen then suddenly was taken back to the first routine.",2
2644,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"App works, but I downloaded it for the full body workout. I'm 16 days in and not a single leg or lower body workout. It's all chest, abs and back. Also, a lot of the exercises that require a switch mid way through and are not split into individual exercises do not give the time nor any direction to switch sides.",2
2645,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Could you please consider some edits in workouts please? For example, ""shoulders and back intermediate"" has no exercises for shoulders. Instead there are plenty of exercises for chest and triceps. The workout is unbalanced. And those ""hover pushups"" are killing me. It seams that the workout is made from random exercises. To have ""triceps kick backs"" and ""hover pushups"" in one cage is weird. I'm a fan of the app, but the more I use it, the more I see it should be improved inthe contentPOV.Thanks",2
2646,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I've been doing the full body and lower body, this is week 4 now week 1-2-3 were great, week 4 feels uncomfortable working out I'm dedicated to the work out been doing it everyday even set other people on the app they found it difficult within the first 2 weeks. The app is good and all but probably it's just me that finds week 4 uncomfortable",2
2647,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Many people who train at home generally have a pull up bar. I wish this app would give me the option to add pull ups to my workout. Because in all seriousness, these back workouts the app offers are terrible. Push ups are used to train chest not back! I understand this is a no equipment app, but you can have better workouts than this with no equipment. For example tell people to get an empty 5litter bottle of water and fill it with sand to do some decent at home exercises. Etc",2
2648,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Good, but balancing is absurd. One day I am close to collapsing after half the training, next day (without changing anything) I could do 2 lessons (I do the full training). Or my different muscles are completely out of balance üòâ Update: After 2 months it is obvious that no real world trainer or sports expert ever was involved in creating this app. After every training one part of my body is killed, the rest is bored. Update: Uninstalled after 8 weeks",2
2649,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"This app was almost perfect, and pretty much is. It keeps me accountable and I add in my own exercises. I had to give 2 stars because the workouts were actually too easy but I couldn't increase the difficulty bc every 3rd day it wants me to do 80 push-ups for whatever reason... day 2 I do like 16 push-ups in 2 sets, 16 crunches, 20 arm scissors... easy kid stuff like this, then next day 80-100 push-ups is the entire workout.....",2
2650,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"It worked well for awhile. Now in multiple of the daily workouts (lower body) the exercises are blank. Guess they're literally suggesting to ""skip leg day."" There also isn't a place within the app to report the issue.",2
2651,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Its a good app. Everything else is just ok except for the fact that it syncs my weight to Google fit without asking. And this happens even when I don't use the app. And this is so bad because it will enter my old weight data into my Google account. It doesn't even give me a chance to update that weight. I have to look for an alternative now.,2
2652,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,ads appear in the worst places. i wanted this to be good so badly but trying to get it set up is really frustrating. dont have ads take up half the screen. im sure the work outs are great but ive tried to start multiple times only to have the ads interfere.,2
2653,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"It wants you to buy all the other workouts or watch a video, except the video won't load so you can't unlock them. You also can't swap workouts for other ones. Decent app other than that though Edit- I have amazing network, ads load on other things it's nothing to do with that lol",2
2654,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"was a fan until I noticed a bug in the calendar, so all dates are screwed up (no reply from support). Can't reset my history, nor erase wrong weight measurements, which sucks when it's syncing with Google fit etc. buggy, missing key features, I recommend you avoid it.",2
2655,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"the exercises simply aren't hard enough. I am reasonably good at bodyweight exercises as I am small so I decided to select intermediate. I was surprised at how easy the exercises were so I chose advanced. I was very dissapointed that once again the exercises were too easy. I only burn about 200 calories a workout. I do appreciate that it lets you track your weight, make reminders, and a workout program but what's the point of all these great features when the exercises are useless?",2
2656,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I tried to write a feedback to developer but then their email collection system is not working, so I had to give a rating here. I hope developer will do away with the ads considering they already get paid by premium workout plans' suscribers. My reason behind that was pop out ads that shows themselves by halting a workout session is an annoying distraction. It is a serious matter for me, because it disrupts workout sessions.",2
2657,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Chose the ""full body 4x7 challenge"" to try out the app. No way to preview what is planned for the whole duration, you can only see the planned exercises for the upcoming day. Difficulty levels are all over the place (one day 10+ push-up variants, the next day stuff, that barely warms you up). The idea of warm-up is 30s jumping jacks. Increasing/decreaseing difficulty barely makes a difference. The supposedly ""full body"" training is overwhelmingly push-up and abs variations with some stretching.",2
2658,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"The app itself is well built, but the exercise selections are repetitive all straining the same region and overall feeling that no thought was put into it. (was using the 30 day whole body exercise ""course"") e.g.: first day almost all exercises were some kind of push ups with nothing in between (except for the app timer)",2
2659,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"After some googling it appears many of the abs exercises proposed by the app (crunches, russian twists, v-ups etc.) actually hurt the lower back and increase risk of herniation!! Not surprised that my lower back still hurts after >1 month following the app workouts, then!! Combine this with virtually no warmup and you're good for injuries. On other exercises: I wish there were options to adjust difficulty in more details, down to the level of individual exercises.",2
2660,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"This app was great but suddenly started charging for anything on the discover page, I paid to remove adds in April and thought that was the only price I'd have to pay. If I already did it I can still access is but I have to pay for anything I haven't used before. This is seriously disappointing.",2
2661,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,This app bugs the heck out of you with notifications even right after you get done working out. I can understand it trying to push you but it is ridiculously annoying. I set up a schedule and it still decides to bug me every hour on the hour to workout.,2
2662,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Be me, tall, 220 lbs, capable of about 20 push-ups on a good day. Hoping to lose some weight. The app asks if you're ""advanced"". ""Advanced"" means ""can do more than ten push-ups in a single go"". I pick advanced. The app immediately tailors a workout routine... that totals around 50 push-ups. Brilliant. If only it were that easy. This thing does not know how to calibrate.",2
2663,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Rather disappointed after reading all these good reviews. I have set the app to full body training. I ended up with a training program consisting of one warm up exercise, nine series of 10 push-ups and then a stretching exercise. That's not a full body training program. Where are the legs, core, abs, biceps, back, shoulders exercises?",2
2664,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I'm no fitness expert, but I know that there are more exercises then just push ups. And that's all this app gives me. I said I could do 10 pushups and though out the entire thing it though I could do like another ten more just right on the spot. No easing in or anything.",2
2665,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"No way to give feedback, the button in the app is broken. So I'll leave it here. Tailoring your ""motivational"" messages so you give women different notifications about having a ""good figure"" is utterly unnecessary. I'm pretty sure you don't send men those messages. There's so many fitness apps, I don't need one that sends me gender based notifications",2
2666,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"App is really good and clever but it has one critical flaw: it doesn't save your progress. This issue was already brought up in feedbacks but it seems it's not been fixed yet. Until that's solved, don't this app is a waste of time...",2
2667,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Was loving the app but they have changed the duration of workouts from 18 to 25 mins to 60 to 72 mins! The shorter sessions were perfect intensity vs time to fit in my day. I don't have an hour +. So annoying,2
2668,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,App doesn't give you any free options without watching videos. Plays advertisements on opening. I might actually pay for the app if I could use it without ads behind every screen tap before I actually get to the content.,2
2669,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"No, dont expect any serious results with this app, the routines are very weak, and some things straight up wrong, like the idea that working out an area of your body will burn fat in that area, which nowadays is known for being fake. Wat was interesting tho was that some exercises sugested where very interesting and useful to my rotine, for this i give it 2 stars.",2
2670,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,They do have some good workouts but you have to pay for everything except for a set of beginners intermediate and advanced courses but even the advanced seem too easy for me and they don't do any regular pushups in the advanced I would just recommend that you do regular pushups instead of these wierd forms of pushups.,2
2671,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Looks good but I'm not ready for so many notifications, even after I thought I turned them off. What decided me to uninstall was that a notification looked like some sort of pep talk, and that's great, but when I tapped it and the app opened there was no way to read the rest of it. I looked around. Nothing. Gone. Annoyed. Uninstalled.",2
2672,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"The training program adjustment is garbage, it is either too hard for one muscle group and ridiculously easy for all other, or just not long enough. I marked the too hard exercises (shitload of pushups) and thumbs up for the no sweat excercises (leg in-out, calf raises etc) the adjustment was the increase of pushups and remove of everything other.... while the overall length was reduced...",2
2673,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Pitiful warmups. I will gladly raise my rating because the app is great and well designed, but the workouts in the app don't include any decent warm-ups. One set of jumping jacks is definitely not enough to get blood pumping before a work out.",2
2674,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"You have no chance of giving feedback when a routine is too hard. You can only skip exercises, but that doesn't really help when the exercises get harder and harder and you don't catch up. The feedback you can give after each workout doesn't seem to have any impact.",2
2675,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"""push-up simulator"" So i have been using this app for more than a week now. Initially they will ask you how many pushups can you do? If you are new to exercise n stuff, most probably you will fall under 1-5 pushup catagory. Now every second day, this app will ask you to do different types of pushups, which will total around 40 pushups!! Ofcourse you won't be able to do it right away! I know pushups are imp. But you need to know that you can mix them with other exercises as well.",2
2676,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I've been using the app for a couple of years now and I had really been enjoying it until the most recent update. The developers got greedy and want $40 a year to let us access the very workouts that were once free. This doesn't affect all the workouts, but there are quite a few of these that I can't get to anymore. I'm really disappointed. It just isn't worth it anymore.",2
2677,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Can't say that I really liked, there a lot of exercises, ok. But you can't change a exercice for an alternative if you don't like it. If you do the challenges that's it, you don't have new challenges progressively.",2
2678,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,It's good because its free. However the gap between Beginner chest and intermediate chest works outs is massive. Like Beginner doesn't prepare you for intermediate etc. Needs an overhaul but has potential,2
2679,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"This app has good aspects, unfortunately it is not suited to real beginners. What they imply by beginner is people who are already hitting the gym and fit but haven't built muscle mass yet. They do not intend true beginners that are starting from a sedentary lifestyle. You can see this as requesting beginners to do staggered push-ups is simply preposterous. Staggered push-ups are an intermediate level exercise. There are also questionable HIIT routines. Get advice from a trainer instead of this.",2
2680,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"One massive problem for me, is that after every workout, the app asks you if you feel comfortable or exhausted, and when I press exhausted the app should make the workout slightly more lighter, but this never happens and I am always losing the motivation to keep up and is so frustrating.",2
2681,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Great app. Pretty intuitive and straight forward. I just had to give it two stars strictly because of the app not having cloud saves for your progress. Make aure you guys do one.,2
2682,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"After updating they started having a ""premium' subscription to their service and they removed some workouts that were originally free with the app. They still have the basic core workouts without equipment but for them to get greedy and hide the previously free additional routines under a subscription service? That does not sit well with me, even after i was so satisfied with their app that i voluntarily paid to removed ads originally?? Honestly really disappointed when app developers get greedy?",2
2683,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Selected full body exercises- got 4 types of push ups and nothing else...,2
2684,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Too much ads,2

2686,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,App is fine. Even free options are good. I believe though that the calories count it shows is entirely incorrect and is entirely inflated for the amount of exercise.,2

2688,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I accidentally selected the premium version and now have been charged.

2689,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"One of the most absurd work out plan. My first day plan (beginner) included 10 exercises out of which 1st and last 2 were streching (Jumping Jack, Cobra Strech and Chest Stretch), remaining 7 were different types of Pusp-ups. This led to lactic acid formation/ severe pain in triceps and chest the very next. There should have been a mix of different exercise instead of just one so that stress on a single body part shouldn't be too much (that too to a beginner).",2
2690,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Great app, keeps me motivated to exercise. Visual explanations. As free as with paid options. I changed the review to 2 stars sinds the app installed a game without my explicit permission.",2

2694,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I am 73 years old. I choose ""much harder"". As a senior aged, these levels of exercises feels to me levels for children. I never believe the promised result are possible with much too soft exercises.",2
2695,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,I wish I could customize my daily workout adding the excercises I like the most. On the sequence offered there are some boring exercises and it doesn't motivate me to keep on the app.,2
2696,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Crappy workout plans that fail to incorporate basic fitness training concepts. For example total body was limited to 2 days of pushups and a day of core workouts. A better total body would have looked more like core- upperbody - core - lowerbody - core. Also the lowerbody challenge likes to repeat the same excersise for the entire workout without focusing on other supporting muscular groups. Hints it gives on what you muscles are sometimes flat wrong. Ending stretches rarely effective.,2
2697,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,There is no reply or update from your side.The app has some bug the excercise are repeating two times continuously at same time in leg beginners and some issues are in shoulder and back. needs more features like gradually increase panel like 30 days fitness app in every category like chest arm etc.,2
2698,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Doing the 7x 4 Full Body challenge, I gave a Thumbs Down in the app for one of the workouts (Hover Push Ups and Push Up Rotation) after injuring my shoulder. But when the next workout plan came out the workouts were still there. The AI for the app seems to have an obsession with these two workouts for some reason.",2
2699,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Stuff on here looks good, but if I have to watch ads to view certain workouts once before having to pay, then I may as well just find a fitness channel on YouTube and get what I need for freeü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",2

2775,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"My main purpose for getting this app was to have a workout plan. Unfortunately, the app only offers 2 different scheduled plans. Once you have done those, you are left with a bunch of workouts that it is up to you to figure out how to schedule, which is no different at that point then just looking up exercises for free online. You are paying for about 2 months of useful plans, then the app becomes obsolete as you are on your own. Bummer.",2

It's normally a solid 4/5 but please, if you have to force us to watch unstoppable minute long ads, put it at the end of the workout, not the beginning. It's very intrusive to the overall user experience. If you have to have long ads, put the short still image or skippable ads at the beginning. Not the long and obtrusive ones.",2

2799,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Best home workout app,2
2800,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Good app and would be 5 stars if it weren't for the incredibly annoying issue of not being able to watch an ad to temporarily unlock a routine. I paid for the ""no ads"" but now I can't access the more specific routines without subscribing which I'm not going to do because this feels intentional or is an oversight. Fix this and 5 stars. (I've emailed about this and received no response.)",3
2801,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I like the app overall, but there are a couple of things that I don't like about it. The first is the number of calories burned per workout. It's entirely unrealistic. I trust my smart watch more than I do the app, especially when it says I burned over 90 calories just doing body weight exercises. My watch said 32 calories were burned. The burning of over 90 calories in only a few minutes requires a much, much higher heart rate. My next complaint, too many ads. Way too many.",3
2802,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"The total body workout is pretty decent for beginners, and I like how you can adjust the intensity by telling the app if it is too easy or too hard. The biggest downside for me is that there are no pre-workout stretches and very few in-workout (or ""post"", as it is at the end of the actual exercises) stretches. For a true beginner, they are setting themselves up for extra pain and potential strains to improperly prepared muscle groups.",3
2803,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Great exercises. Bad app. Even though I paid for the yearly membership it still makes me ""unlock"" exercises every day, doesn't remember my favorite exercises (which it did before) and forces me to watch ads like when I was in the trial period. I have no idea how to contact the app developer to get this fixed. Love the exercises. Can't stand the app.",3
2804,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Solid app with a great range of exercises. Ads don't feel too intrusive and functionality is decent. Syncing to Google fit is a bit finicky (once you complete a workout you have to go back a few steps for it to sync, it doesn't happen right away), and the calorie burn estimate is way too high (although that might be a Google Fit issue, rather than this app).",3
2805,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I love how personalized it is. If a particular session is too challenging, the app will provide an easier one next time if I wish. Having a countdown trainer and videos to show how to do each exercise is invaluable. I paid for it after the first exercise session I did. I changed my rating from five stars to stars after finding out what I paid does not get me access to all of the workouts.",3
2806,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Overall it's great my only complaint is that the ad space is too large and some of the exercises could use better explanations of how to do them. Mainly though I dislike that it only gives you tips occasionally. (Like when to breathe) sometimes it will give the tip halfway through the workout or not at all. Thats not as useful as it could be. Offer the voice tips with every exercise and five us the option to silence them completely. Other than that it's pretty good.,3
2807,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Definitely good in that it is helping me work out more, but between exercises it sometimes stops and gives me the option to start the next exercise, which I like, but for stretches at the end it doesn't do this and I end up scrambling from cobra stretch to chest stretch (or I just ignore the app) as there is no time to get from floor to doorframe. They give 3 levels for each type of exercise (chest, legs, core etc) but no way to modify the level to better taylor it to your needs.",3
2808,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I started with the six pack in 30 days app, and it was very good. there was a program and i got resalts. I then went to the arm work out with the same experionce 5 stars. So when I downloaded this app i was excited for the options it offerd with chest, legs and back, but it was dissapinting with only three exercises of varying difficulty for each with no program, This is not what I expected. Also some of the exercises are not relevant to the area of the body that is supposably being worked.",3
2809,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Overall, love the app. I just wish there were more tips and tricks with making sure youre in the right positions and maybe adding a yoga/specifically stretching section. It would be great for off days and to jumpstart my morning getting out of bed and pushing for that motion first thing when it may be difficult to jump right into my daily workout.",3
2810,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Simple app w/ decent free workouts, but the difference between workout experience levels is minimal, ads are sometimes so broken that I can't get to the actual workout (one ad that pops up has no X option, so I have to repeatedly restart the app), and the chime after each workout is SO much louder than the vocal coach or the countdowns that my dog's anxiety goes off from the other room and he panics. I had to uninstall since the bell can't be turned off. Would keep, if ad bug and bell are fixed.",3
2811,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Review of the free version: Challenge programs are good with excellent set of varying exercises. Abs and other routines do not vary sets, howver. The full body challenge is the only routine to feature intensity adjustments functionality. HOWEVER, it makes the adjustment (easier or harder) to the entire program (all muscle groups/days), not only to that day's set.",3
2812,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"The reason I downloaded this app is because it's on the list of apps that sync to Google fit. However, after having used it twice, I can see that it doesn't sync workouts to Google fit, so it's useless to me. The workouts themselves are decent (maybe some beginner exercises are too easy). It's clear the app developers don't speak English as their first language, but it doesn't get too much in the way of understanding the content. PS The developer removes all reviews <5 stars (3rd time I posted)",3
2813,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Okay but some problems. In the first 3 days it was mostly stretching but on the 4th day you start to do push-ups,now I know you can make your plan easier or harder but the app would be better. If it would let you build up to a regular push-up instead of giving it to you like that the app would be better but overall the app isn't bad so far. I have to take a break from the app to build up to the push-ups it expects me to do.",3
2814,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Needs 2 major upgrades (based on full body workout) 1 only indicator for difficulty is number of pushups for a full body workout. Would be nice to have a few indicators for different muscle groups because some days are incredibly difficult while others are a breeze. 2 needs to have a way to customize / eliminate certain exercises that I can't do many or any of (supine pushups) or just hate (inchworms) and substitute with another that works the same groups.,3
2815,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"The app itself is well built, but the exercises are disappointingly easy if you've been working out moderately (maybe once or twice per week) for more than a month or two. I'm using this app until I can get back into a gym, but as soon as the coronavirus blows over I'm gonna delete it and not miss it at all.",3
2816,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Bad pacing. I did the beginner exercises almost every day for about two months, and at the end of that time had no trouble doing any of them. By the time I'd finish a workout I'd barely be sweating, so I decided to go up to intermediate This wasn't a mistake, but it wasn't great either. The amount of exercises, and reps required have drastically increased to the point where I'm wondering if you're actually supposed to go from beginner to intermediate. This app really needs to look at its scaling",3
2817,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Honestly a very solid app. The only reason I'm giving it a 3 star is because after 2 months of working out, the advanced section is not that challenging any more. I would suggest adding a new section called hardcore or ultimate madness, or add more challenging moves or pauses. Other than that, definitely a solid starter app.",3
2818,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Great routine ideas. Most exercises are worth it. However when doing the full body plan, you cannot adjust the difficultly level for different body parts of areas. So arm day absolutely kills me so I make it easier and make program right for me on arm day. But then it makes other regimes easier too, so the abs and leg days are way too easy.",3
2819,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"It is an okay app for providing a steady plan for body weight exercises, but really- some of these are very limiting and far too easy. I selected the max difficulty for abs, and it isn't really all that hard. Maybe add much higher difficulties and different workouts? Most of the workouts repeat the same 5 or 6 exercises for half an hour. You can work much harder in a much shorter amount of time if you do it differently.",3
2820,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Workout is a bit too hard, even though I was honest with the app. If I choose it was too hard and that I should maybe get an ""easier plan"", it just gives me the option of restarting back to square 1 with a longer and harder workout. Or to use my previous plan. Some days are just push-ups with harder ones in them. This app is OK but making me loose hope.",3
2821,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"When I said at the start I could do 1-3 push-up cos there was no 0 option the first workout had 4 pushups!!! I have literally never been able to do pushups but it keeps asking me to do pushups and has even increased it to 6. Please give me the option to get rid of pushups, wall pushups and incline are fine or even knee ones but I cannot do regular ones. The rest of the workout is good tho, I do have to skip the pushups whenever they come up.",3
2822,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I'd say the app is great for workout. However, for some reason it bugs on my pixel 8 from time to time. Whenever I want to browse the app for longer than 3 minutes it starts to glitch and so I can't tap on anything. Restarting the app works but it's still very annoying. Fix please",3
2823,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Good design, and good way of showing how to do the workout that you're currently on. However, I attempted the 7x4 ""full body"" and all it gives me is upper body workouts. They have lower body workouts on the app, but they aren't implemented into the full body routine. And since we all know leg day is important that is the reason for -2‚≠ê",3
2824,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,This app is overall good. I'm using this app since 2 month and now I'm fit and healthy. But the problem is that some exercises are too difficult and cause irritate such as crab walk and inchworms. and whenever I dislike these exercises and tell it's to hard but they add again this exercises. So pls fix it. Thanx,3
2825,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Very good appüòÆ‚Äçüí®üòÆ‚Äçüí®üòÆ‚Äçüí®. Update: You need to change the algorithms because in one workout, there are too many push-ups, I got like 5-10 push-ups over and over again. I think it was like from 15 exercises, 10 or 12 were just push-ups",3
2826,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"On day 3, it'll say a workout is 20 minutes long, I'll follow it and then it'll say I did it in half the time, which is not correct cause I times myself. Where is it getting this time value? Is it still counting for the exercises that want you to do 14x of something? I'm doing these exercises slow, so it should not be half the amount of time. Please fix time value.",3
2827,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I've been using this app for over a year and while the app generally is decent for workouts it does suffer some clear drawbacks. 1. There are advanced excersize that you have to keep skipping (e.g. V-UP). 2. It's 1 muscle group per session and never varies even slightly (do 100 pushups). 3. It shows your progress in fictional ""excersize weeks"", making you feel like you're getting nowhere. 4. It tries to give advise mid excersize that often cant be heard or is pointless ""try to breath naturally"".",3
2828,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,There needs to be some improvements made in the UI and more exercises should be added,3
2829,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,It is a very good app but it wont to update more it should give the data of thin people how to how to exercise but they don't ask the subscription so then the downloads of this app increase very it give a very good exercise with also dumbbells with apps in the full body exercise days they don't give the legs exercise only give the shoulders chess hand and abs exercise,3
2830,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Its a great app for home workout, no doubts. However, the voice instructions are very few to none. Most of the time, it doesn't give breathing tips which I believe is a very important part of the exercise. And the app's time is clearly busted as it give the wrong time spent. Example, a specific workout require 21 mins and you spend the exact time or maybe more, but the reports always shows lesser time spent like 16:51 or 14:02. I hope these problems are taken into consideration.",3
2831,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"The app is good but there's no save progress. Imagine you restart your phone and the progress you have done in your apps were gone. And also when I was doing workouts, I accidentally tapped my home button and get back, the app said I should start it all again. That really confused me. I would like you to fix the 2 common problems so we can rate high stars. Thanks.",3
2832,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"To the developers. I've been using this app for almost a year since covid started. And I have to say that its been great. Although there's one small issue. The audio disparity. Each time I complete a set the chimes that come off it is immensely loud in comparison with the voice-guide. And it's come to a point where its super annoying. I would set my phone volume to low to level down the chime. But in doing so, I sacrifices the voice guide. Please fix!",3
2833,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Good exercise circuits, but the difficulty does not adapt. I'm almost at the end of the 4wk challenge. The app does not take into account how tired you report at the end or how long it takes you to complete an exercise. The number of repetitions just increases at a predetermined pace and sooner or later it completely exceeds your abilities. Unless maybe you have to be on an intensive protein shake diet to keep up...",3
2834,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Pros: Lots of workouts, all free with ads. Unlike most of the competition, the app isn't intentionally made useless if you decide not to pay for it, which is great. Cons: Seems like a pattern with Leap Fitness Group, - what could've been a single, convenient app, is split into a bunch of apps, all differing even in functionality for no apparent reason. Home Workout and the Lose Weight App could easily be combined into a single app. Same with different apps for men and women.",3
2835,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"This is a bizarre app. At lower difficulty levels, the workouts can be great, because they string together lots of simple movements in a short time, and the result is quite intense. Later on, however, the higher difficulty workouts are just half hour grinds on overly complex and non-strenuous movements that are not only frustrating, but also barely get me sweating. Great first impression, but weird and disappointing the longer i used it.",3
2836,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I would like better integration with the google fit app, I would like to see more information there about the program and gain heart points (witch I currently don't) in the app. Everything else is almost perfect. The app is very easy to set up and use and has very nice graphics explaining each excersise. One minor thing is that I don't get notifications for work outs. Also I would like to be able to schedule specific programs for each day of the week so I can keep better track of my programs.",3
2837,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Good app. Results are visible enough...if you're wondering why I rated this app 3 stars, it is so because of the adsüòÖ",3
2838,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Everything is fine except hover push ups. These are simply too hard in such a amounts. If there would be possibilit to edit amounts of single exercises it would be perfect. Edit: Instead asking for better review for no reason maybe you will improve app :D? Changed to three stars due to fact that there is one exercise that I cannot simply do, and one that I'm not capable of doing in such a amounts. It simply discourages to exercise... Will probably change to different better app.",3
2839,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I'm new to this app, hence there is little to say about it. Based on my experience, the app is user-friendly and easy to navigate. I've just completed my challenge for today. I feeling happy! I think this app can help me keep fit. Anyone can try it, it's really cool. I'll give it three stars for now.",3
2840,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I picked this up and used it (full body challenge) as part of a nightly ritual to combat insomnia with success. Sticking to it for over a month, I found that the time of sessions went from around 35 minutes (ideal) to over an hour (seemingly excessive). Not sure why the sets were increased instead of the exercise intensity. I was pretty happy with this app until I found myself spending more and more time on it.",3
2841,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Good workout app... BUT After using this app for some time i can say that the app has many things that have to be worked on. 1. The ""push-up level"" is not a good way of determining a persons fitness level. 2. The ""Full body chalange"" should be called the ""Upper body chalange"" because in the 30 days i didn't see one leg workout. 3. Fix the bug where after you click on the full body challange and then turn off the ad, it returns you to the main page. I have to repeat that process 6-7 times before it lets me do the workout. 4. Throw out stretching from the middle of the workouts and keep them at the end... it is not effective before the end. All in all, this is a really good app if someone wants to get in shape, but it needs more work on it and workouts that are based on scientific research.",3
2842,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Very useful app, but: 1. Too few stretching exercises 2. It was better before, when the full body 30 days challenge was only for the upper part of the body. It would have been useful to keep it, simply changing the name. Personally I found it very good in combination with the same challenge for legs. The present full body 30 days challenge is still insufficient for the legs.",3
2843,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"It's a fantastic app and I'm really happy with the results so far. There's only one little aspect that made me rate 3 stars, I'm using Android while my wife is using the same app on iPhone and even if we're both on the premium plan my wife app looks much better, from graphics to interface everything look much more professional on iPhone. I'm a bit disappointed as even aesthetic is part of the experience, well at least for me",3
2844,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"It's ok but could be better. One aspect is that the exercise of the next course could be much larger during the short breaks. About 10 % of the screen and the rest 90 % are just background with a clock in it. When you wanna' know what's next, you have to come as close to the phone as you would hold it. Despite from that there way too few courses for advanced people (and I'm not even advanced). I'm doing regular sports all my life so I'm in a good shape but far from a gym muscle guy..",3
2845,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Using this app from past 1week and i must say that the exercises are really engaging. However i feel that the calories burnt count is too high. Also, as a feedback it would be great if you could provide an option to remove some exercises from your plan. Actually i am not a push up person but the plan asks me to do all different kind of pushups back to back in a day. And this happens every 3rd day. Making it very less productive. You are not reachable on the email address provided on the app.",3
2846,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Was a great app but they changed the interface making it more complex for beginners to know where to start and also the exccercices became way more complicated, 1st day beginners getting full push-ups for a day really takes a toll on the self esteem of the user. I had recommended to a cousin of mine to use it since i remember it being a good start for me and a week later came back to me saying it's too hard even on the easiest difficulty.",3
2847,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,As you said i gave you 3 star rating. Now i again request you to add the workout plan to gain weight. It is very helpful to skinny one. Your all apps are so much good but no app is made for weight gain. Kindly consider my request add the workout plan of weight gain or made a new app for weight gain.,3
2848,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"All good except the chest workout is terrible. Also, the ending option to choose if it was hard or just right doesn't do anything. No optimization to improve",3
2849,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I am quite enjoying the app and all its tracking features and have tried all the beginner workouts. The reason it's 3 stars instead of five is the comparative difficulty of the beginner plans. Abs, arms and legs were spot in on. However shoulders and back was way too easy, I felt wanting after... And the chest was WAY to hard for a beginner... Couldn't finish it. (90 pushups in a recommended 11minutes... For a beginner?). Would still recommend the app. But improvements are needed",3
2850,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"It was great although it's my first time but have really felt the impact , am really grateful for the app",3
2851,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Most exercises are fine. The problem is that the supine push-up is the only exercise that's good for upper back development, which is not enough. The biceps and lats are completely neglected. A lot of exercises, for example the romboid pull, that are used that are good to get the blood flowing, but not for hypertrophy. All in all, the app is great to get beginners to start working out and it's great if you just want some movement to become healthier, but it's not good for muscle development.",3
2852,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Really like the idea of the app, but the difficultie per muscle group really differs a lot. Specially between certain exercises there is a big difference in difficulty, resulting me to have muscle pain mostly in my chest and back. Legs are almost always to easy, and abs differ a lot per exercise. If you could adjust difficulty per exercise it would be very big upgrade. Also changing excercises if you can't do or dislike them would be great.",3
2853,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I think this is pretty good app and would have given it 3.5 stars. Some suggestions for improvement. 1. I would like to set myself a reminder in the app for future workouts, but the app only allows a everyday reminder, not 3 times a week as I wish. 2. One of the exercises in my workout, a star jump is really suitable for me as I have a bad foot which is a long term injury, and I would like to remove this exercise and substitute another one . Overall though I think this seems a very good app!",3
2854,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I didn't want to rate it lower since it's a great app, but it's has an issue which is you lost all the progress if you just change the music through an other app or use an other app even if it's just seconds,and you have to start all over again, I been working out for more than one hour and I lost the progress because I changed a song I don't like and the app record only 10 min of work out",3
2855,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Five stars once: -you can alter the workouts. I'd like to add to the abs advanced with more reps. -weight was synced from google fit instead of the other way round.

Thank you I am observing some little change in few days and will whole change in full body 28 days and so on. ‚úå‚úå‚úå‚úå‚úåüòòüòòüòòüòòüíØüíØüíØüíØ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§.",3
2863,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Very thing was going well... I mean the workouts.. . The app was synced with my gmail. So today when I downloaded the app in another phone and synced with my gmail everything. The full body workout plan which i was doing is completely changed... I had done 24% of the full body workout but now it is gone to 14% and another leg workout callenge came up like 12 % which i did not even do... please check the database.. for any errors..... i was daily doing the workout and now i feel like i lost,3
2864,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I've left one star because some exercises are just impossible to do solo. For instance, the V-UP needs someone to hold your hip. Also, abdominal crunches are impossible without someone holding your feet (I just stuck mine under the sofa). Fix these instructions, and I'll give it 5 stars. changed to 3 stars",3
2865,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"This app has been pretty okay for like the last 2 months but I just noticed it restarts your workout if you open it in pop up view which is annoying. When you minimise the app in the pop up view on a Samsung note 10, the app restarts your entire workout when you open it on full screen. Surely you should be able to say play music or an audio book in the background while working out since it's motivation to some of us. This should be fixed in the next update or at least a feature to play an audio book and/or music should be added so that you don't have to move from one app to another which is distracting and time wasting",3
2866,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Really wish I could give 5 stars but some really basic things make this app lacking. For one, the in app feedback goes to an email that is full so your email gets sent back. Second, the full body 7x4 challenge is actually just upper body and abs. For some reason lower body is separate. Then when you finish all 28 days and want to start again you can't. Its just done. I really like this app and will try to keep using it but these basic things make it extremely frustrating.",3
2867,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"In general pretty great app, I've been using it for a few years on and off. But I think I'll never finish the four week challenges, as I'm very uncomfortable with e.g. diamond pushups and spiderman pushups (especially as there are so many different ways to do these wrong and injure my elbows). I wish there was an option to veto an individual exercise. Skipping them or (again) not finishing the 4 week challenge once again is very dissatisfying.",3
2868,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Workouts are good and helpful. There are two issues am facing. 1) I am okay with you giving ads before and after workouts, but the type of add that are popping up I have complaint on that. 2) I suggest you provide your own videos as example rather than linking to someone else's YouTube videos, the issue is some of the videos are blocked or no more available.",3
2869,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I gave.it a 3 after 2 workouts and will update. There is a daily workout program, excersize routines look to be structured well and I love the tips you get throughout doing them, they always seem to have the right tip at the right time, for example saying 'Your lower back or.neck shouldnt be straining' or reminding you to keep your head straight. it would be useful to have an animation of each exercise on the screen once the whistle blows, and a landscape mode to see clearly",3
2870,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Would have been a 5 but the voice coach, is supposed to speak at the beginning, during and at the end of an exercise set. It doesnt speak, instead, it sounds like a corrupt 56k dial up tone or tired 30 year old hard drive. This means you need your phone in sight to see the end of timed workout exercises. Have uninstalled and reinstalled several times on different devices, same issue. Otherwise, the workouts do work well and they DO produce results so long as you eat smart and sleep well.",3
2871,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I have been using this app for sometime. Although is good to get your started, the level change difficulty is rediculous hard... Cannot be possible that the default total pushups in the beginner level is 30 and the intermediate 100 with stagger pushup at the end of exercise session... Is insane",3
2872,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Good app. It has all body part training beginners, intermediates, and advanceds. But the main thing or bug is: Everyday same things. only 'full body' changes. For example I did ""Arm beginner"". The first day's exercises were diamond push ups 6, inchworms 8, push ups 10..., and i did them all. But when i open the app second day, exercises are the same!",3
2873,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"The app is easy to use but there's a big problem... A majority of the exercises only have one set, or insufficient sets. Having only one set is little to no muscle damage at all, which means barely any muscle built. I suggest using the workouts only as a reference and make your own workout.",3
2874,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"The short descriptions and Gifs help to show the exercise, but the YouTube link for an even better demonstration is an excellent feature. The workouts are also manageable but do not include any rest days for the 30 days. Neither does it include any workout of significance below the waist.",3
2875,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Seems good for just having a routine, but I would prefer the option of being able to substitute something like pushups with something that may be easier or harder, but doesn't strain my wrists.",3
2876,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I love this, but having also used the abs in 30 days app as well, I would give 5 stars if there was more variation on the workouts. There is beginner, intermediate and advanced for different muscle groups, but the are all the same. I paid to remove ads and I think this would easily be 5 stars with this update.",3
2877,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I like the app but after 2 months it stopped letting me increase workout intensity past a certain point. I ended the month at a certain intensity and wasn't even able to start at that same intensity when I restarted the full body program. I can't have progress if I keep having to restart the month on easy sets and low reps. I would buy the full but it just doesn't seem worth it if I can't pick a program and stick with it while the ""coach"" continues to increase intensity for me.",3
2878,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Good presentation, huge variety of exercises - perhaps too bewildering, frankly. The 'automatic coach' - presumably an algorithm - adjusts plans on request to make them easier or harder, but I find such calibration often over- or under-done. It might be better to simply offer users the option to tailor their own experience by adding or removing particular exercises to the existing programs.",3
2879,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Good workout app. I actually have seen small results on my end with definition on my chest and bi/triceps after about 3 weeks every other day. Ads are annoying at times and the voice sounds robotic. I wish my wear os watch could display the set or time left on the screen and my heart rate like on the apple watch. Overall not bad.,3
2880,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,All fine. But I can not do some exercises because they are only for people with heavyweight enough legs. And as I understood there is no alternative for these exercises. So I can only skip these exercises.,3
2881,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Good (but hard as well) for beginners. I liked & used it for 2 months. But lacks the difference between beginner to intermediate full body routines. And why you have to choose between ""full body"" (which actually is upper body) and lower body? You shouldn't forget any body part... And a lot of mismatches. Still not bad app.",3
2882,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"This app keeps syncing my weight to google fit every time I open it instead of just when I update the weight value in it. This is annoying because it's overwriting the accurate weight data on Google for (which honestly It should be reading, not writing). I've had to disconnect the app which is annoying. @developers plz fix Decent bodyweight strength training exercises for at home though.",3
2883,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"This app is very helpful and has some good exercises. It allows me to unlock once the paid exercises by watching ads. But after I purchased the Ads Removal, the option to unlock once is no longer available, which is very unreasonable and frustrating.",3
2884,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Great app, Nice. The only thing is that you really should add harder exercises. I did the 4 upper body ""advanced"" trainings in a row. And I got tired obviously, but didn't fail at any exercise. Followed all the tips to make it harder. Didn't get any extra breaks. Posting anonymously so you don't dismiss this as someone that wants attention. You really could add an extreme, and impossible workouts. And I'm not even 16 yet, so you know... Pretty damn easy for an adult athlete. Thanks!",3
2885,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"It certainly gives a pump but does not actually build muscle, just short term...",3
2886,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Overall a great app. However the amount of push ups is ridiculous. I can do 10 at once no problem, but the workout they have you do in the 7x4, even on the easiest setting is way too high. Every other part is just fine, except this one.",3
2887,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"It is a good app but the only problem is that in a 30 days course of upper body and lower body there is much of the exercise repeating and in 1 month course there is not much difference in your body it looks as similar as it looks before the 1 month course . This is the only reason why i am giving three star to this app otherwise it is all good ,and yes! plz don't show to much ads 0lz control on them . And plz fux the problem of time spent it shows a wrong time spent if plz fix it . Thanks!!",3
2888,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"i would give this app a much higher score, but it has an input to tell it if you don't want to do a certain exercise, and one of the options for why is ""injury."" i have been telling this app for a full year that jumping jacks injure me, and it just keeps thanking me for my feedback, and then everytime i open it up jumping jacks are still the only warmup it suggests. requesting feedback is worthless if you don't do anything with it",3
2889,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,It's good because the exercises need no equipment and are easy to find time for. It also hooks up with Google fit. The main problem is the exercises are unrealistic for beginners and the progression is too fast. Especially the all push up days are awful.,3
2890,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Not bad, but the full body workout challenge is far from a full body workout. The emphasis is on upper body, especially chest. Abs are thrown in some days, and some shoulders every so often, but every workout you're only focusing on one area of the body. That's not a full body workout. Legs are not even covered in that particular program. Legs are in a separate program by themselves, so if you want a true full body workout you have to do 2 programs. It did get me sweating, though.",3
2891,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Alright, could be better. Exercises are mostly clear and the app is easy to use. Slightly annoying is the over-reliance on chaining identical exercises. If i've just done push-ups followed by a push-up hold followed by incline push-ups with a 25-second gap between, I'm obviously overloaded to failure.",3
2892,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Good app with a variety of exercises, its not as easy to quickly find the ones you want to regularly do. You need to remember the full name of each one, if you want to do a variety that it. Would rate higher if possible to implement a favourites section or current workouts.",3
2893,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I would give this 5 stars because it seems like theres a lot in here but I thought it was supposed to design the perfect daily workout for you and your goals. Like you open it and it knows what day it is what youve done so far, and what you need to do next. The first two are in there if you make a couple clicks but the last one is not. At least in the free version, it lets you pick which is ok, but a rwal trainer would say something like "" because you did abs yesterday, we're doing arms today""..",3
2894,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"its a great app for organising ones workouts, just please fix the workouts thats not unlocking once you watch the videos, because thats just ridiculous, like really now. the algorithm does not want to give the workouts no matter how many times you watch the videos. Please dont mess people around just for money cause that shizz is too greedy to be spending ones life acquiring.",3
2895,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Simple to use and easy to get a workout in if you don't have many options. However, I don't think the workouts are realistic whatsoever. My first workout involved doing a mix of 64 pushups (normal, inclined, wall-armed, etc). Most people can't even do 10 pushups on their first workout, yet you want me to do over 60? You're setting people up for failure. Also, I selected the ""full body program"" and have not done a single leg workout yet, it's all arms, back and core.",3
2896,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Great app, been using it for a while! Something I noticed though is the 30 day challenge has dumbbell variants for some exercises where the targeted exercises do not. Also the 30 days has simple exercises which make the program longer. If you could make it include more strenuous exercises for a shorter plan, that'd be great.",3
2897,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"My only issue is that there are many exercises that require a bench, there should be an ""I don't have a bench"" option to replace those with something else.",3
2898,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,It was not that bad it was a little bit hard originally but the app has redid everything's was little Maurice drive me to lose some weight and gain some muscle,3
2899,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Working through the full body 7x4. I cant speak objectively of the entire program because I haven't finished, but the workouts are far too short and easy. usually combine the daily challenge with two other workouts and a run to get a full workout. Daily challenge takes between 2 and 5 min after rests were reduced to 10 sec. Ability to tweak current fitness level better would be great. Calorie counter is way off. Anyone using the app to adjust caloric intake will be set up for failure.",3
2900,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I went from running 3 hours a day to app's beginner plans. Was hard but doable knowing practice makes me more capable. Day 3 I found some arm/chest excercises impossible for me struggling even to learn no-knee pushups. Option to change plan to easier does not change the excercises. I would suggest more of the same until time to build muscle, but I am not a trainer.",3
2901,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,App was fine 5 stars until recently. Im always switching back n forth from this app to youtube because I listen to music while working out. NOW everytime I switch windows on my phone it logs me out of the current workout??? I have to restart the entire workout and skip to where I was previously?? NOT COOL!,3
2902,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"This is a very good app but the only drawback I see in this app is the lack of exercises. Having a limited number of exercises, time to become fit increases by the user alot and more than that I wanted some really tuff exercises. I would give 3 stars for the exercises stages, -1 star for not being helpful to the user in the future and -1 star as it lacks some tuff exercises (free) and also that it lacks some creativity for the users to make it more enjoyable + it lacks a proper workout dairy",3
2903,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Perfect app for calisthenics lovers but not that intense even on the advance mode as compare to a gym regime. Used this without resting (by skipping all the rests) but i feel like i did only warmup as it contains a lot of stretching exercises and not any intensive ones. Overall it's a very good app for the beginners, keep it up team üëçüëç",3
2904,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Recently installed... Waiting for results... I'll rate an give a feedback again if it works... But todays work out was quite good,3
2905,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,It's a great app and it got me into working out serouisly and helped my life out in general but its super beginner tilted and from the pictures it severely over promisses muscle growth for that you need mechanical tension and that the primary driver of that is working out close to or to failure this app doesn't disclose that at all and just gives you workouts and they are not very intense and you will get stuck at a plateau which made me stuck for 3 months but overall avoid what I did and urgood,3
2906,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Select beginner, select sedentary life style. Select glutes to target. Workout 1 has like 20 pushups and nothing else. ????",3
2907,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,I give this app a 3/5. Its a good app to use if you just want to get into the routine of working out kr just to shed off some weight.My disappointment came with the applicability of the exercises. This app should suitable for using at home but jumping jacks in an apartment or shared house is alittle bit noisy if you are on the heavier side and if you're tall space might be an issue.I got this app to replace my winter dormancy but if the app forces me to go outside in winter it aint home workout.,3
2908,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"The only thing I don't like about this app is- There is no preferences are given about how to exercise , which exercise should done today which on tomorrow....and in it's premium version also doesn't have any plans for personal training and one more confusing things,it have many options there which make it more confusing and time consuming.... means how could I know from where I stand and I doesn't get any satisfactory results using this app. But I found it better than others health apps.",3
2909,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"So, first off, I would like to thank you guys for providing a good app to get people in shape, that been said, this is not the most effective/optimal way to build muscle, or a habit that said. First of all, there is an inadequate amount of warm-ups, and then wrong stretches after the workout. Also, after a while, for muscle growth, you have to add weight, and I propose instead of using a completely different exercise, just show the same one, but weighted. I would write more, but not able to.",3
2910,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Great app, great workouts. Good for people like me who have zero access to a gym or any sort of equipment. However, a dark mode for the app would be appreciated. Please add a dark mode to the app. (Lack of dark mode is why I'm reducing the stars). Overall, good.",3
2911,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Does what it says it will: give you daily at home exercises. The graphics and instructions are super helpful to me as a beginner. However, a lot of misleading info because no way in hell am I burning 500 calories from 20 minutes of their relatively light workouts. Future feature I'd like to see would be to choose exercise replacements and see how that impacts your workout. For example I can't do a military pushup but I can do a pike one fine.",3
2912,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Like most fitness apps the difficulty dramatically ramps to impossible (e.g. day 10 of full body had me doing 104 pushups (of varied styles, this based on me saying I could do 10 push ups in one go) in a row with 30s breaks in between ), but even then there are some ridiculously easy days which left me not sweating at all. Unfortunately this is probably because to train certain muscle groups, you basically need weights. [Devs - if you ask me to give 5 stars to 'inspire you' I'll reduce to 1]",3
2913,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Free premium during this period, but there's still ads. Not a very good way to promote your premium fees. I guess I should never get premium cause there'll still be ads? The timer is also inaccurate. I did a 35 minute workout and the app says 21 minutes. The calories burned counter is also inaccurate. 30 minutes of exercise burns about 600+ kcal, even if you're not doing anything vigourous",3
2914,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"TLDR: not great but works ok. Runs well, but the workouts are pretty obvious and you can't exclude exercises that don't work for you. Everything is basically the same ~30 moves in different combinations. The devs have tripled the advertising recently and started making the close button tiny or ineffective. Some of the ads are also very mysogynistic from an American perspective.",3
2915,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"There is no doubt that app is best for workout at home and definitely going to help in reducing weight. However I found one issue in this App, sometimes during the exercises it makes phone overheat.",3
2916,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"So I really like the app, but with the newest update, the voice countdown and trainer voice are not working. That is a huge issue as the final 3 second countdown is necessary to get in position for timed workouts. Hope this gets fixed soon. Besides that it is a great app.",3
2917,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Extremely good app. Perfect workout plans.the only little flaw is that it doesn't have a time limit. Suppose When i do the 'chest workout ' it makes me do warm up and then it says do 6 push ups ,that's the problem. You should add a time limit for 'number of reps' Related exercise like ,after 1 min. It should say 'you should have done at least 4 pushups by this time' if it happens it would become the perfect app. Plz add this feature leap fitness group. Thanks. It has good Workout plans",3
2918,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"This company puts out great apps, I love the workouts but.... The notifications have become a major nuisance. Ive turned them off in the apps settings but I'm still getting up to 6 a day. (bug?) Their other apps dont do this.",3
2919,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"The app comes with great workouts and workout diaries. But the biggest flaw is that it doesn't save your progress to your account. Unlike other leap fitness group apps in which your progress is saved and you can easily change devices, my progress in this app was erased when I changed devices",3
2920,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Has to be fake reviews for this app. It's not a great app. It's ok. Horrible cheap computer audio. Full body workouts are upper body only. Can't much on the settings of the pre determined workouts so if it's too easy or too hard there isn't much you can do.,3
2921,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Not a bad workout but I have to do three of them just to get my heart rate up enough. The workout setup definitely needs fixing. I selected full body and my workout was over 30 pushups only. The ads are annoying but I don't feel they're as intrusive as other apps.,3
2922,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Pros 1. Great for quick guided home workout. 2. Voice coach is an excellent addition Cons 1. Animation graphics do make it look a bit cheap 2. Would be great to have option of entering time estimates for reps to allow for a more seamless workout with minimal screen interaction,3
2923,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I'm sure this is a good app in general, but it doesn't give you the back focus if you choose female, and their levels are overly optimistic. Their ""beginner"" level is ""can do 3-5 pushups"", but I can't even do 1 pushup. It would be great to see this updated to be a little more universal.",3
2924,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,No option to rate individual exercises to have them reworked. Either the whole workout gets easier or you need to keep skipping the ones that aren't possible. App also keeps telling me to try with weights... Which goes against the whole point.,3
2925,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Not a bad app. Has a good selection of excerises but i feel it need to incorporate different ways to up the difficulty like how to incorporate resistance bands. Also BMI can be deceiving. Probably should include tape measurements to calculate body fat percentage. Overall not a bad app just need to do a few extra reps to up the intensity.,3
2926,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,A lot of ads. Some more annoying to close than others. Video links out of date on some of the exercises. Like the pre made challenge with different workouts so you're not doing the same thing day in day out.,3
2927,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Update made this app boring .Before the update I loved this app . It would help you train daily and have a huge gallery of workouts so I would never be bored . After the update the ""whole body workout challenge"" feels wrong and if you want to make it harder it just adds a set , which I find boring . I wish I could go back to the previous version so I could give this 5 stars",3
2928,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"It's a pretty good app, quite a few of the exercises are absolutely ridiculous though. Air humps, for example üòÇüòÇ I often find myself skipping a lot of certain ones because they literally don't do -anything- for you.",3
2929,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,I am doing the 30 day challenge but there are no leg exercises included. I have to do the begineers in Leg practice individually. You guys should divide the workout in different categories and give one each day and most of the exercises are set twice one after another. I have to put ut correct sequence myself. Please fix these bugs.,3
2930,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Overall, pretty good at its job, but as someone who really needs notifications to get myself to work out, is not very useful. I should have two reminders for the weekend and weekdays, but neither ever show.",3
2931,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"ok, could use improvements. BMI calculation is off height and weight only (that's not how it works). No ability to substitute a single exercise. The challenges go from ok to ridiculously intense in far too short of a time (day 10 is 104 pushups with 30 second break between sets). Surmising the workouts: Arms; do push ups. Chest; do push ups. Back; do push ups. Abs; do crunches and push ups.",3
2932,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Nice exercises, some of them are pointless but most are worth doing. Great variety and some sort of personal workout plan works well. But the stretches they implement in the workout sessions are not all inclusive and do not target every muscle group used in that specific exercise. If you don't know what you're doing you might be put off by the lactic acid build-up that is supposed to handled by the stretches. Would recommend but do your own research and stretches afterwards to avoid discomfort",3

Option to sync with fitbit device...",3
2934,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"This is not the way to train. There are no shortcuts to getting in shape, but this app makes you feel that way. I give 3 stars because the actual exercises could work, but not the way they are programmed. If you want to get in shape, go to ATHLEAN-X on youtube and stop wasting your time. (I am in no way affiliated with ATHLEAN-X, I just want you to not go to V-Shred)",3
2935,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"It's good, and I just completed the 7x4 Full Body challenge. However, I wish there could be more progressively difficult excercises to do past 4 weeks, but it sadly ends once the 4 weeks are up for the Full Body Challenge. Honestly, the Full Body Challenge needs to be longer.",3
2936,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,The reason I read it at 3 was because it doesn't take into consideration if someone is has health issues or is handicapped. It tried getting me to start doing jumping jacks and different things like that and I couldn't do them because I can't stand on my feet that long and I definitely can't jump.,3
2937,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Might as well rename this to ""the pushup app"" Started with the daily workout routine where you workout everyday for a month and it's frustrating when some of the workouts are too easy so I tell it to make the workouts more challenging and then when they are at the perfect level, they hit you with a workout where it's ALL pushups. All 16 workouts are pushups or variations of the pushup and I can barely do 10 and they make me start with 12, so the rest is impossible. Then I tell it to be easier",3
2938,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,This was my favorite work app. since the update the lower body training plan only show one exercise. disappointing. This has been resolved. But you need to review day 11 for lower body. It goes from x10 to x8 to x10 again with 2 lefts and no right. Very confusing,3
2939,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Good exercises for your health but not really for strength imo. Some exercises are put in the wrong category of body parts (Ex: exercises for the buttocks are put in the leg work category), some other exercises don't fit their level (Ex: Some beginner exercises are not for beginners, it will just make you extra exhausted) and some others need more info in order to be made properly.",3
2940,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,The all round work out part of the app seems to concentrate on just push ups and sit up type exercises. After 2 weeks of doing basically the same thing it is very boring. The trainers need to get an imagination as there are many other things that could be done to mix up the exercises to get the same result. While I am not a trainer I have been going to gyms and have had one on one training for many years so do know what I am talking about.,3
2941,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Developers ignore all feedback. This app is really useful for getting in shape without any equipment or having to go anywhere near a gym. However, there's always room for improvement, & I see lots of very good suggestions for tweaks in review feedback, which the developers simply ignore with a generic reply 'give us 5 stars to incentivize us' . It's clear they're not interested. Ironically, I'd probably give a 5* review if the developers showed a willingness to take suggestions on board...",3
2942,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"The app itself is great but the workouts are barely customizable, and there's no way to do a ""full body"" workout. They have a challenge which is called full body but it actually is inconsistent and doesn't cover every muscle group.",3
2943,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"#GOODSIDES - i love it, it helped me lose 1 kg in 1 month #BADSIDES - however i hate the ""side bridges left and right exercises"" , it's against the natural pose of human and also no real video about it. - the discover more section is counted by time, so hard to do just in time, i highly recommend it should be like the normal, the time makes me impossible to work out * Thanks for reading this !",3
2944,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"The app is good but there should be a perfect category for the real slow beginners (like me). This app started off with almost a average excersiser which didn't work for me. rest of the thing let it be the app interface, alarms are good.",3
2945,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Used to be really good, but the subscription locked content kinda ruin it for me. I prefer to pay once to get the exercise set I want/need (pay x amount of money to access intermediate wider muscle for example). I hope the devs will consider this",3
2946,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"This is not a review! Are there any serious athletes who have adequately used this app and can let me know if this app really helps? My exercise regime is intermediate to advanced. I just want to streamline my workouts and that's why want to try this app. Let's see how this goes. I will give it a shot, if it doesn't help me I'll uninstall this right away.",3
2947,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,The app is helpful and simple to use but it would really be nice if there where custom workouts u where able to setup because I don't like skipping a part of a workout but I'd like to do bits from a few different workouts in 1 set and this would also make the reports more accurate if something like this is implemented I'd be more then happy to reassess this review good job so far guys,3
2948,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Pretty good app for people who are getting into working out. I downloaded it for conditioning (I am a rock climber) and found the workouts to be a little bit short and kinda repetitive.,3
2949,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,There is an annoying problem. The app keeps syncing weight to google fit. The number is manually entered days ago! Please allows user to choose whether we want to sync weight data with/from/to google fit.,3
2950,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I like this app. It helps a lot in my daily execises. Although it has a big technical problem. When I open the (full body challenge), the app stops working and I restart my phone many times to be able using the app properly",3
2951,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,ATTN Small Living Spacer. DO NOT USE if you have small space. Some exercises require large area to do it.,3
2952,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I like the app, don't mind ads as much even though they are pretty intrusive. however, how do I transfer progress when switching phones?!?! The app has backup disabled and there seems to be no in-app backup. Please, let me know.",3
2953,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Great app but with the new bug fixes On july 1st it makes downloading workouts impossible. once i see the ad i skip it and then wont load so then I go again but the video is a still frame and cant watch the ad so until i get a video i'am stuck in a loop.,3
2954,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I've just started using it but it's very easy to follow along with. Although some of the exercises don't have a very detailed description of how to do them safely, if you exit the app to learn how to do them then it doesn't keep your place in your workout.",3
2955,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,I do enjoy this app it's nice how it guides you through but I wish you could edit the workouts so you could add or delete certain exercises and be able to adjust the number of reps per exercise. It can't be that hard to implement that and it would make it a 5 star app for me if they did.,3
2956,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Issue with synchronization with Google fit app. Only one exercise module gets syncd. Rest don't show in fit app if done one after another. Kindly fix it. Rest all is awesome but the sync feature is very essential for me.,3
2957,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"It's an okay course, and it definitely has everything needed to know how to do the exercises, but as for the 7x4 challenge, it seems to assume that I'm a fatass desk jockey, and that this is my only workout of the day. I run heavy equipment all day, and just want to bulk up a little. There's a survey at the end that asks how you feel from easy to exhausted, and I think there should be one of those at the beginning so that I can control how heavy of a workout I want. PS: will give 5 when changed.",3
2958,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Great App for mussle building but don't listen to how many calories it tells you have burned (even if you put in age/hight the app doesn't follow BMS) and it doesn't give much clarity on when to work out and how much in the range of a week and finally dont listen to its Healthy-Unhealhyy weight range meter its mildly Inaccurate it telling you a 14 yr old who only ways 130 and is 6ft is not in a healthy weight range.,3
2959,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Great app. But I've facing some bugs. After watching an ad I can't skip the ad or exit from it. The ad just freezes and I need to restart the app to continue.,3
2960,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"My arms are completely gone not even halfway through push-up heavy days of the 7x4, despite begginer setting. Shame (both ways I admit) because it was hard but doable until day 7, now it feels like neither. Otherwise good app, no annoying bugs.",3
2961,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"This app is great,I love it,it helped me be stronger,However it doesn't have all the important features,There should be in the description of all the workouts the body parts that is affected by this workout,There also should be a feature that lets you choose which body part you want to effect.",3
2962,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I like the app yet i want to say that if someone wants to do a split training , developers must provide proper combination of exercises ,take for instance if i do pushups today on my chest day then doing pushups next day for arms could be an injury causing idea as my muscles haven't repaired yet properly. So the app developers need to work on that. However i liked the way they initiate each workout with warm-up and stretching at the end very well encoded between the workouts.",3
2963,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,The app is good If you don't go to fitness. The workouts on legs are good. On chest are just different kinds of push-ups. On abs are very easy. And what I hate the most is that there aren't any Biceps workouts. Still it's just better to go to a fitness centre.,3
2964,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Excellent app with good detailed explanation. Important: Critical information like ""Exhale when you go down, inhale when you go up"" should be given during the rest time. Currently the virtual instructor calls out such information when half of the reps are already gone. Imporvement: Animation explaining the inhale and exhale instructions will be a good addition to the app",3
2965,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Didn't understand how to use this app. On the main page there is a choice of leg workout, arm workout, chest workout and so on. There are more variations of these if you click ""Discover"". However I didn't find any program involving full body or several muscle groups. I don't want to do 20 minutes of push ups only, I want some push ups, some squats, some other muscles and vary exercises throughout the week.",3
2966,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"The full body program seems to be more just an upper body and core program, and I'm not really a fan of doing days that are nothing but pushups. Just kind of demoralizing, and I end up wanting to give up on that instead of realizing halfway through that I can't even get halfway through what's supposed to be the easy workout. It just feels bad.",3
2967,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Great for working out however the bmi settings are based solely on weight and height and this is definitely wrong. Im 180 at 5.8 however I am definitely not 27% fat im closer to 18-20% it does not take into account that some people got onto this app with a heavier muscle density then others as they have already been working out. It also does not take into account the three body types which would have a pretty decent influence on your bmi score. Use other equipment to track your bmi.,3
2968,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"The weight tracker is nice but I have gripes It's built off the assumption that you can spot-reduce fat (which is not true). Prioritizes abs and forgets hamstrings. It works out whole muscle groups at a time, which will eventually lead to unbalanced muscle groups. Do the fullbody challenge, then the beginner exercises below it, and then look for more thorough and balanced workouts on YouTube",3
2969,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,It's ok. Layout is unorganized and hard to find stuff. Be nice to save favorite ones and make custom workouts. Or just have a fave list so you can find one you want easier.,3
2970,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Very nice app good training exercises although I think they should make it in such a way that if you try to increase or decrease the difficulty of your exercises without an internet connection it should be saved until when you have an internet connection and then perform the task,3
2971,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I paid to remove ads, but now it will not allow me to access some workouts unless I pay for the premium service. I would pay a one time fee for premium but not a recurring fee.",3
2972,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,It's a good Excercie app.I am using this App before one week of lockdown till now. but now there should be a option where we can add our desire excercie. for example in abs beginner there are some excercie that I want to add in intermediate abs excercie. I hope this kind of option will be available in future updates,3
2973,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Nice features, ruined by countless ads. You can remove the ads by paying a monthly fee, but the price is too steep. It costs the same per month as Apple fit, while providing nothing of subscription value.",3
2974,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"This app has been great but it's really hard to keep up with the push ups expected of me with how overweight I am, I wish I could set it to do a few push ups everyday for practice instead of having a full pushup day twice a week! It's very demotivating",3
2975,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Some of the numbers seem a bit off for the beginner level workouts. Abs beginner left me very sore for a good few days. App functions perfectly fine.,3
2976,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Good app for workout but the arms exercises are just a waste of time and its useless. Rhomboid pulls, arms raises, laying sideways doesn't do a thing ither than that, the app works fine. Oh 1 more thing, I'm doing the 1 month challenge but most of the exercises are push ups, im tired just doing push ups. Please update a better exercise routine.",3
2977,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Not worth the full subscription. There aren't that many exersizes and I've had it for 4 months and have never seen a new workout or anything change. I chose this app because it's rated the highest , I'm just not sure how anyone who paid the overpriced subscription would be happy with this",3
2978,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Since very long, I reported following 2 issues, but disappointment that still they are not fixed. After a workout completes, it shows ads instead of finishing bell. It syncs only last workout of the day with Google Fit. I had done 3 workouts, only last was synced to Google Fit.",3
2979,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I was hoping this would be like 6 Pack And in 30 days, basically 4/7 workouts of all types available. They're made by the same developer so I subscribed immediately. I've cancelled that, there are only two 4/7 workouts and the rest are limited to doing the same over and over, no progress. I want shoulders and back 4/7 most, with three 4/7s like Six Pack. For what it is I'd pay a small one time fee but it would have to be AT LEAST three different levels of 30 days each for everything for more.",3
2980,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,However the app is a great help for those who can't go to gym for work out.. But there are issues 1). If I completed a work out in 20 minutes it shows 9-10 minutes 2). After a time it stopped syncing with Google fit 3).full body must be added in weekly work out plan but it's missing 4).it must have been having step counter.,3
2981,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Program is stuck in an ad and won't go to workouts. It won't show me the ad. It's just a gray screen with a buffering circle and a ""play"" symbol that isn't able to be pressed. 2 stars added for quick response.",3
2982,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,I will give you more stars after you have given dark mode in the app. Thanks,3
2983,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,This seems okayish. Although I selected my plan was too hard for me after the first time use. The revised plan went from cardio to strength but it had wayy more workout? How does that even work? I had to stick with my current plan. Maybe y'all need to tell the developers to fix AI.,3
2984,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,App is nice and i don't want to complaint about ads cause'it's free. The only thing that disappoints is the 'Full Body Workout' mode. FBW shows no workout of legs in initial weeks and if you state FULL BODY then LEGS ARE IMPORTANT. Include leg workouts in FBW it will be much better.,3
2985,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Such a fantastic app for workout but I appreciate if they have some workouts for Bulking and a feature to make own workout plan.,3
2986,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"This app basically had stretching exercises, nothing more than that. You can't fulfill your desired fitness goals from this. I am totally amazed how it became editor's choice. Lmao",3
2987,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,It's a nice app but I'll appreciate if calisthenics training without equipment was also available,3
2988,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,I think it is good for home workout but if it can share the food that we can eat after workout then it'll be more better No doubt this is a good app for workout whose are begginer like me But for advanced people who workout daily then it will be a normal app for them because they already know that how to strech their and etc. They know more than this i think this is better but many more reasons are their that's why i can rate it only 3 out of 5 If it can improve itself thant it will be a proud,3
2989,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Started off really well, had a good variety of workouts other than the ones offered on the main screen, but to try the other workouts you have to pay now which wasn't an option before.",3
2990,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I'd like to be able to make custom workouts. And also, it would be cool if I could blacklist some exercices because I just can't do them physically and I'd like to have other options that work better for me.",3
2991,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I am writing to request that you create two videos, one for men and one for women, that address the issues I am facing. I would prefer that the videos be created with a human trainer, as I find animated videos to be difficult to understand. Please address my issue. Thanks for your efforts.",3
2992,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,It is a good app overall but what stops this from benig a 10 is the inability to edit the workouts its possible in the ios version but you cant edit reps or the time on android which is insane to me.,3
2993,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,This app is good for body exercise but it contains lots of ads,3
2994,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,The exercises are very inconsistent in difficulty making it bad for beginners who want to start building muscle also the app only gives the illusion that your feedback to specific exercises does something,3
2995,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Too many ads,3
2996,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Would be nice to be able to remove manually certain exercises in the workout program because there are some i just can't seem to do well, and something that bugs me off a lot is the vocal text that is confusing when talking about the next exercise (bunches ""take a rest"" and ""next exercise"", so the timing gets confusing for me)",3
2997,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,It's really for home home workouts,3
2998,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,It a nice app and it's user friendly.,3
2999,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I used this app in 2019 and really enjoyed it. I didn't make it very far into the whole body workout, but it really mixed up the workouts nicely. I decided to start using it again, a few weeks ago. But, the whole body workout has ONLY been giving me upper body workouts. I have yet to encounter a lower body day, and I'm 2 weeks into it. I'd give it 5 stars if it worked the way it did when I used it in 2019.",3
3000,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,how do you put the next exercise,3

3004,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"It was great although it's my first time but have really felt the impact , am really grateful for the app",3
3005,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Helpful,3
3006,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,The aap is more than good but that they consume more time and the result is less than good like ka average üòï result but you have a dumbbell so the good app for you ( I will complete the 28 days challenge then the I will give you feedback ),3
3007,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Useless. It can only help beginners I use the app for 2 months no results,3
3008,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Nice,3
3009,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Good app and would be 5 stars if it weren't for the incredibly annoying issue of not being able to watch an ad to temporarily unlock a routine. I paid for the ""no ads"" but now I can't access the more specific routines without subscribing which I'm not going to do because this feels intentional or is an oversight. Fix this and 5 stars. (I've emailed about this and received no response.)",3
3010,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,It really worked for me,3
3011,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Very good plan,3

I have literally never been able to do pushups but it keeps asking me to do pushups and has even increased it to 6. Please give me the option to get rid of pushups, wall pushups and incline are fine or even knee ones but I cannot do regular ones.

3057,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I like the app overall, but there are a couple of things that I don't like about it. The first is the number of calories burned per workout. It's entirely unrealistic. I trust my smart watch more than I do the app, especially when it says I burned over 90 calories just doing body weight exercises. My watch said 32 calories were burned. The burning of over 90 calories in only a few minutes requires a much, much higher heart rate. My next complaint, too many ads. Way too many.",3

3197,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I've been using this app for over a year and while the app generally is decent for workouts it does suffer some clear drawbacks. 1. There are advanced excersize that you have to keep skipping (e.g. V-UP). 2. It's 1 muscle group per session and never varies even slightly (do 100 pushups). 3. It shows your progress in fictional ""excersize weeks"", making you feel like you're getting nowhere. 4. It tries to give advise mid excersize that often cant be heard or is pointless ""try to breath naturally"".",3

3199,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Good working aap ü•∞,3
3200,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"The workouts are generally good and require little to no equipment. I only wish it offered a finer-grained way to tailor the workouts to my abilities (beyond just rating how hard an entire workout was). For example, in the beginner ab workout, I've always felt that the leg raises are 100x harder than all the other exercises combined. The app tells me how to make some exercises easier--just not the one that is actually too hard for me.",4
3201,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Perfect except for one thing. Been using this app for a few months and the results have been amazing! Went from 137 lbs to about 150. Started nice and slow, because I could only do 2 push-ups at a time. Now I'm muuuch stronger and plan to keep going! The only thing I don't like is how the lower body 7x4 challenge doesn't have all the features of the total body 7x4 challenge. The total body has an option to adjust the workout both before you start and after you finish. No such thing for lower.",4
3202,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Wish there was a way to bookmark or favorite certain workouts and routines so you can organize them instead of constantly having to go to the discover page and scrolling to find it every single time. And maybe a way to save stretches/warm-ups separately from your workout so it doesn't track it as part of your weekly workout. Otherwise it's good if you already know what you're doing and what you're looking for. Super basic,4
3203,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"The great: excercises, illustrations, built-in-timer, voice prompts, tracking your history: all top-notch. The awful: currently on day 4 of a 7x4 ""full body"" challenge. Day 1 consisted of 2 sets of 4 varieties of push-ups, day 2 was a good variety of core, day 3 was shoulders and back... so far ok. Day 4 is back to push-ups. So far the only thing I've seen remotely approaching a leg exercise was mountain climbers. The full-body challenge coach definitely needs some work.",4
3204,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I really enjoy this app, it has a nice amount of different workouts and stretches. I also like that it's simple yet effective in its use and not complicated to follow since it gives descriptions or videos on how to do certain things. I do wish they had more categories though, most of it is based on muscle gain or weight loss, but it'd be nice if they added workout and stretching categories for mood boosting/ease anxiety and for those with mobility issues or elderly.",4
3205,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Exactly what I was searching for! The workout experience for a newbie is so easy to get into. After a quick questionnaire, you're given a recommended routine that will work a different area of your desire each day and will even gather your feedback to tailor the difficulty to suit you so you are actually getting results, but not overextending. However, I do wish there was a ""favorites"" or even ""playlist"" option so that I don't have to search for my stretches before doing the full workout!!",4
3206,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"This app has good workouts, and a good system to teach you workouts that you may not have done. There is an ad at the beginning and end of most workouts, but these ads are usually skipable after 5 seconds. There are small pop up ads during some exercises, but they are so small you probably won't notice them. My only complaint is that the buttons are very small and can make this app annoying to use if your hands are shaking. All things considered, pretty good body weight workout app.",4
3207,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"A good app. Needs a good tutorial for all features like click on this icon to find info on how to do this exercise and what muscles you're focusing on. I enjoyed the exercises, but the routines are not for the stage of fitness I'm in currently. Needs to be simpler routines for me. Like baby beginner option or something like that. It was just too many in one go. I'll probably return to this app once I get into shape a little more.",4
3208,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Great in home workout! I have gotten a few new phones since using this though, and my progress doesn't come with me. For instance, I did the 30 day challenge a while back, but when I get a new phone the last parts of that circuit are locked unless I do it all again. That's my only knock. Been using this for a long time and really happy with the compressed, useful workouts.",4
3209,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"These apps are excellent. One major flaw. When you pause the app during the middle of a workout, it continues to count the time during the pause as calorie workout time. I pauseed because I have to go to the store in the middle of my routine. When I was done it had a lot of me over a thousand calories of exercise. If using a exercise towards counting a calories, this is not accurate. I did send an email to the developers but have not heard back. Don't count paused time towards burning calories.",4
3210,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Great for workout ideas. Fundamentals are the best. I also like that the users can arrange the exercises to suit their needs and adjust the rest time between sets. The exercises I prefer not to do I simply modify it or replace it. I can tolerate the ads but the one thing I would like to see gone is the trophy and confetti at the end of a workout (they bring no satisfaction). Thanks.,4
3211,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Great at home workouts with many stretching exercises. Also has a challenge routine that gradually increases the workout time/intensity. However, once you complete a month, you are left with the same workout as the last day. You should not rely on the calorie counter because it counts minutes required to complete the exercise (irrespective of the ec exercise I suspect) and if for example, you leave the app open and are interrupted, it can show even say 900 Kcal of energy burned üòÜ.",4
3212,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"After trying a lot of other apps, this one just works. It's simple and effective. I use it to get my regular workout in, which augments my sessions with a trainer. The only thing I would add is to have a way to disable some exercises. For example I have a bad knee and jumping jacks are no good. Wish they had an alternative for just the few potentially damaging exercises.",4
3213,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"What's up with all these 5 star 1 word reviews? I don't quite believe them. This app is okay, better than NTC since Nike ruined it. The ads aren't too disruptive, and it has a good simple format, with an overview of the workout, a preview of the next move, and one tap to skip to the next. Good thing you can also skip the excessive recovery period between every exercise. You also need to come into this app with a good knowledge of technique. The little animations don't help much.",4
3214,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"It's nice for getting a routine going and it's easy to use. Some workouts are a bit too easy while others will take you a bit longer, but the reason I'm only giving it 4 stars is that it really over-estimates your calorie burn. For example I did the advanced leg workout that took 30 minutes, and it said i burned 491 calories. I don't think that's accurate at all. Other than that the app is great.",4
3215,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Great work out app, reason I gave it 4 stars was because it's a little clunky to navigate to downloaded workouts and to filter between free workouts and the ones that are part of the premium membership. If they could add a tab on the left hand side that displays all downloaded/free workout available for free users that would make it more user friendly. Else besides that it's a great workout app and I would definitely suggest paying to get rid of the ads.",4
3216,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Almost everything about the app is perfect, save for one thing: the app only has the option to skip an exercise entirely, rather than to substitute a similar exercise in the event a certain one cannot be performed for some reason. An easy example of this would be with incline/decline exercises for those who do not have an appropriately sized surface to lean on with enough space around to work out in.",4
3217,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I like it so far, but some of the beginner routines aren't super beginner friendly. Specifically a lot of the upper body workouts include sets of full push ups, but I can barely do one push up per workout starting. The rest of the exercises are pretty closely tuned though, so the options to make the whole workout easier aren't helpful. For the moment I'm just doing the push up sets and taking it at my pace. Probably going to have to repeat week one a couple times to get to the starting line.",4
3218,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I have a few complaints about this app, pretty much all of which are centered on the seven by four program. The seven by four program is a program where you work out 7 days a week for 4 weeks. The problems regarding this apps version of the plan is that it does not incorporate legs at all, is far too difficult for certain muscle groups as opposed to others, and as you working certain groups to failure every 3 days. Nowhere near balanced in any way shape or form.",4
3219,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I'm on day 18 and it just gets stupid from here out of the 28 day challenge üôÉ new exercises that you are not prepared for and one you should've been working on alot earlier in the process. Day 19 it calls for 76 push-ups in different forms but its getting stupid ü§™. Definitely seen results and love video explanations could use more detail in body posture and alternatives would be nice, side bridges hurt my knees. Great app for free. Also more time between switching stretches. Thank you",4
3220,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Good app for body weight exercises with minimal equipment usage. Since equipment is used occasionally, I would have liked to see pull-ups incorporated in some of the routines. If you have a pull-up bar, you can easily figure out where to sub some of the back exercises. The feedback mechanism allows the program to adjust to be more or less challenging for your next iteration. The rest periods challenge your endurance but can be extended if needed.",4
3221,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Good app overall. I feel like the arm workouts are senseless and dont do much as would a 10lb dumbell or bag. Also, the stat tracking is wonky. I would personally like to know how many times I worked out a week, not how many exercises I did. Its also odd that the stats never reset. Its showing me how many exercised and calories I've burned since I started the app months ago. The app would function better if the stats reset every week.",4
3222,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Goal was to be in better shape post quarantine. Diet and this app have helped me lose 40lbs. I have loved the app. Without subscription the app still offers a lot of programs and exercises I never done even while in military lol managing the difficultie of routine, it's been fantastic to use through quarantine .*Devs if it's possible to reverse that reset PLEASE LET ME KNOW! I went to reset a challenge workout and it reset all of my progress data",4
3223,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Well designed app, but I wish there was a way to increase the difficulty of the ""Advanced"" workout aside from adjusting your rest periods. I want to do tough workouts, which is what you'd expect from the highest level, but instead I'm getting served mildly strenuous exercises with no way to get anything harder besides doing the 7x4 challenge, which doesn't fit the routine I wanna follow.",4
3224,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Excellent app with a clean interface. The option to access each instance of a workout by watching an ad is great. There seems to be a small technical glitch where it doesn't always sync workouts to Google fit, especially if you have gone through multiple workouts in a sequence.",4
3225,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"A tad different from the iOS app but still the same home workout app I love. But coming from an iPhone, I feel it's missing the sophisticated UI and some features. I'm on the premium trial on Android but I was using the premium app on iOS, am I missing something? I want the same sophisticated design and useful features as those on the iPhone version. Thanks!",4
3226,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Ok. Third review: the expanded content and annual membership is something that is worth the investment. I would like to see another ""challenge workout"" that spans a few weeks or so, but I do enjoy the variety that they have. Previous review(s) from 2019 and shortly after released.... was 5 star, had a great concept, free version is still 5 star thiigh it can get repetitive after a while. 9.99 a month? No thank you, theres plenry of small gyms that offer almost the same price for a membership.",4
3227,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"This is great app that helps keep a person accountable and able to track daily workouts. Really the only thing I would say this app is missing is the ability to substitute alternative workouts. For example, due to a personal injury I am unable to do push-ups without pain so i wish there was an option to choose to perform an alternative workout that targets the same muscle group instead of skipping the workout.",4
3228,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,As long as you put in the work and keep working out consistently you will see good improvements and it is pretty straight forward and easy to use as well. Unlike some other apps with ads every 5 seconds this shows ads only before and after workouts that you can skip very quickly. I find this app a fun and healthy way to keep me in shape.,4
3229,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"It ia the forst day I use the app and I'm already asked to rate it... This might change... It is ok, after 2 years of doing nothing and considering I was never a sporty type, the app's excercises were too hard, I couldn't finish the 4th excercise of the 1st day and skipped the rest, could not even lift myself from the ground, then at the end I wad asked if it was too hard, still, gives you warm up and cooldown and adapts the excercises to your capabilities after the first try, so far so good",4
3230,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Everything about this app is great *except* the reminders. This isn't the only workout app I use, and the reminder messages say: ""You're body needs energy! It's been X days since you've worked out!"" It's actually pretty embarrassing when that pops up, especially when my other trackers record my other exercise. (1) If this could sync with something like FitBit that would be cool (2) If the message could be: ""You haven't logged a workout with this app in X days"" it'd be less embarrassing.",4
3231,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"It's actually pretty cool. Some of the exercises it asks you to do is weird but you can just skip it if you can't do it. You should attempt them though, slowly, if you do the beginner workouts they wont time you, they'll time your stretches so you know proportionally what to do but the actual thing you can attempt them slow and once you're done sit up push the button and keep going.",4
3232,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Seems pretty nice, ads are non-intrusive and workouts are nice. This app has gotten me back into exercise, which is really important at my age. There is a problem with the BMI calculator, however. I checked my BMI in the app and it said I was almost underweight. However, using a .gov website I saw I was in the 38th percentile for my age and height, which was in the middle. But other than this, works pretty well.",4
3233,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"If I find a certain workout difficult and want to make specifically that workout easier, it's not possible. My whole plan is made easier instead. For example, if I request for an easier workout for ""abs"". It will update the whole plan to be easier including the ""biceps"" (which I don't want)",4
3234,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Works really well.. but sometimes you don't have more than 15-20 minutes to work out in the morning, and then it really doesn't help to gave 33 exercises. Please create the option for having shorter workout (but then more intensive perhaps)",4
3235,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"A very nice and well thought out App. The exercises are laid out nice a simple to follow direction. Even has accompanied video clips to show you how the exercises are done and for thinking about the lazy guys who want to get healthy I Thank You Plenty, V",4
3236,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"So far I lovw the app, however I have two complaints: The calories burned per workout are unrealistic, my smart watch calculates way less calories. Then I'd be great if we as user could enter whay devices we have at home so that the app can take these tools into account while proposing workouts.",4
3237,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Love it! Cardio mixed with calistenics. But i'd prefer if there was an option to customize the plan. For example, i wanted a little easier work-out because i am only starting, but i'd like the option to customize how much of the work out is cut. It would be nice to customize the plan by myself to an extent But overall great, DEFINETLY recommend to anyone who is even thinking about starting working out",4
3238,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"My Gateway into fitness. Keep to the plan (needs adjustment at the start) and keep it up, you will see geniune results. My issue: once the 30 day plan is concluded, I haven't found a method that lets me make a new one. The 30 day plan is a great motivator that gameifies your workouts (to a point), while also steadily escalating the difficulty. So not getting a second, harder, run hurts a lot.",4
3239,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,It would be the best app for exercise if it didn't have to many ads. I don't like how u have to watch ads to do harder workouts.but I like the app...just hope that they put less ads.,4
3240,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"There should be an option to change what muscle group you want to focus on i.e full body, chest, arms, abs, legs. Instead I have to delete the app and change it. Otherwise, it's a vey good app",4
3241,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"This is a good workout app, especially when you don't have equipment or they're bad or can't go to the gym, ""Home Workout"" app serves right as if you're with your coach during a training session.",4
3242,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,This app is great.... but I would suggest you to customize the app more friendly by including the option to weight gain....or an instructing facility who would guide you what exercise you would do for specific purpose for week person....I hope you will fulfill the requirement,4
3243,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I've noticed some slight changes on my body after using this app for 2 weeks. My chest is starting to shape up while my abs are becoming more visible, maybe that's because I have a tight schedule. I do recommend this app for sure.",4
3244,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,overall i liked this app i could really feel the workout in the places i wanted to but the fact that you have to watch adds to do other workouts really ruins the workout sometimes but i still like the app and im definetily still keeping it,4
3245,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"5 days in, solid app. Easy adjustments to work out level on the fly. Voice prompts are a plus. Left the fifth star off due to full page sneak adds.",4
3246,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,It's a great app and inexpensive for a subscription. My only suggestion is that as a beginner you have to figure out what's best. There needs to be more guidance.,4
3247,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,I like this app been using this for about 6 months and have lost about 10kg coupled with a diet but some stuff need improvement harder Vs tougher challenge - no guidance on the difference. Option to use dumbbells seems random Marking an excercise as too hard or don't know how do too seems to nothing. End of week difficulty increases disproportionately. E.g large jump in the number of exercises. Does not promote rest days,4
3248,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Absolutely amazing and the design is good.I like the feature where you are able to backup your progress so you don't worry about you starting over.,4
3249,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I have been using the app for about 6 months now. The abs workouts are good. The upper body workout could use some variety. There are too many pushups in one workout, which is hard on the shoulders. Overall, the app is very useful.",4
3250,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"One of the best apps out there..Would be great if they give options to replace a few exercises especially in case of basic and intermediate levels..other than that no complains.For new comers,You will feel stronger if you complete 28 day basic challenge..keep up the good work.üëç",4
3251,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"The best part is that, it gives you a complete workout plan with ads and an option to go premium adless .. at least you get a genuine workout plan based on your metrics... Most of the apps give plan only after you pay... And not to mention workout plans here are very practical and give the desired results. Thanks!",4
3252,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Some exercises are quite difficult. like unbalanced. Sometimes I wonder how people can do it and can people really do it?. For example side bridges and side planks. I hope the exercise is changed to a more balanced one.,4
3253,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"The exercises are great all though I do think they should have a option for home workout with for example dumbells butsides that It's a great app and I do recommend the ad free experience (not the subscription but the ad free experience, costed me 3 euro) so my rating: 8/10",4
3254,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"2 things: -The notifications are never sent at the right time, they are always randomly delayed by anywhere between 3-60 minutes -It needs more equipment workouts. I don't want to use a separate app just with dumbells for a workout, it makes no sense",4
3255,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Overall good app with lots of different exercises.Can do any type of exercise and the exercises are adjusted due to your weight and height and age.Great app,4
3256,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Please, add extra option to repeat the voice announcement of amount of activity. Generally, it is announce at the beginning. I forgot, is it was 18 or 16 times? It would be better if it will announce also mid of activity.",4
3257,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Some abdominal exercises are impossible for a beginner to do. I bet that I can‚Äôt make them - they still appear. I feel like I haven‚Äôt completed the program.,4
3258,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,It's a good app I just hope there was a feature where u can select 0 pushups as a starting point otherwise I find this very helpful,4
3259,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"So far,I'm loving the app.It's helping me where I need it to and with a bit more exploring and getting used to,I know it can go from 4 stars to 5.",4
3260,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"This App is really helpful. For like a few weeks I downloaded it, I can see a whole lot improvement in my body build up.",4
3261,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"It's a trustful app , it can make you grow your muscles but not like gym muscles as we don't have gym equipments in home . Though it is very helpful ‚ò∫Ô∏è.",4
3262,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"It's good but there's one problem and that is no leg workout on full body workout.al I'm saying is put leg workout on full body workout.Thank you, keep up the good work üëèüí™",4
3263,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Great job at explaining and showing how to do the exercises without wasting time, UI is easy to navigate and simple the color palette needs to be lightened up, exercises are challenging enough to cause your muscles to grow without being impossible which is enjoyable,",4
3264,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"In my opinion, there should be a 30-day mode for each body area which takes into account the level of difficulty. Overall, it is a nice app for people who don't have exercise equipment or dumbbells and can only train with their own body weight.",4
3265,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Is a brilliant app to keeppeople motivated to train daily with several different routines and exercises. üí™ Sadly though, it appears they took off the ability to customise and create your own routine. Which means it no longer caters to more experienced people who need to create a specific routine to mert their needs. üòë",4
3266,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,I just like everything in this app from the exercises to the schedule arrangement it's really great.,4
3267,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,It honestly looks like a scam but it's not they ask you for routine and what you want to work on I just finish abs work out and I feel a lot better know.,4
3268,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Very helpful app, no need to pay to gym to get a silm and health body, you can achieve it by using this app from your comfort home.",4
3269,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,This app has everything perfect including the things that it's meant for the AI is very smart and the workouts are quite helpful I would give this a 5 star but it has to many ads.,4
3270,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"the only reason why I didn't give it 5 star because the workout sessions are too hard, even if you choose the simplest one it makes you to do 20 push ups in total! which is obviously not easy for beginners.",4
3271,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I love how this app works, I don't have any workout equipment, and I don't have a gym pass, so this app helps a lot! I do wish that there were so.e more free workout picks.",4
3272,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Very nice app with lots of different exercises. The only thing that disappointed me was that there no proper way to continue the 30-day plan after you've finished it. Shall I test it? Adjust the difficulty to harder and do it all over? But then all the workouts have already been marked as complete... That post first month part is quite confusing.,4
3273,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Amazing application! I intend to buy a premium plan in the near future. It's a bit expensive.,4
3274,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"This app improved over the time, but it's still missing a feature. Which is ""take this day rest"" or ""take a day off"" if you consider adding this option the app will feel more complete imo.",4
3275,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,It's really a good app having all the exercises and well planning. It should automatically go to next excercise when the countdown finishes or the push ups completed instead of waiting for user to press done button. It can be achieved using 4 seconds count down for one push up or similar to that. Also adding background music will be a great.,4
3276,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"It's a pretty good app if you want to get in decent shape with easy, to harder routines made daily, or just work out the part of the body you want. It'd like to see the ability to make custom routines, with number of reps defined by the user. Also, get a Google account sync function to save all the data whenever you change phone or whatever reason you have to uninstall this and come later. ALSO! If you have done your exercises already before the ""reminder"" alarm you've set, notify you, don't show it!  Thanks for this app, and I hope you keep implementing things",4
3277,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"The overall plan and exercises are really good. Some suggestions: Instead of just saying ""4 push-ups"" after the rest period, the app could directly begin the timer and pace the 4 push-ups and end the exercise by itself to go the next one rather than waiting for the user to press ""done"" to enable going to the next one. Also, Background music could be added.",4
3278,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Very very useful and good app for home workouts. I really liked the guidance and timing done in it. The only drawback i found is if a user accidentally create a duplicate workout, there is no option available to del the same from history. The 2nd thing is in settings-workout settings there is an option called restart progress, it's of no use. It's not at all working, we will get notified that progress has been restarted but it doesn't so. So this and particular deletion is needed.",4
3279,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Great app. Very easy to use which really helps me to exercise and if your short of time there are quick workouts. Of course like all exercise you need to keep at it, but it's had been a week and already I have noticed an improvement, both physically and mentally. The only reason I have given it 4 stars is because it would be useful if it had a warm up and down section with stretches (or for them to Incorporated into the exercise routines if you wanted) that would make the app perfect.",4
3280,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I simply love the app. I use it daily. What made me take a star away from them is the very recent update. The video option the app has, is amazing. However, earlier it showed how trainers do the exercises and where their arms and legs went, and also the stances which are humanly possible; but now they've even made the videos animations. It is weird because you do have an animation button, put them there. Videos should be videos. Please resume to the old thing, it would be much appreciated.",4
3281,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"It's an amazing app, but I have to knock off a star, the app asks what your fitness level is before you begin, and how many push ups you can manage. I entered 30. The first days workout wanted nearly 90, that's far too many for someone to push themselves through, use the app as a guide, but if you start losing form during an exercise, stop and move on to the next. There's also no reminder for rest days, the daily notifications are great for encouragement; but they should include days for rest",4
3282,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"This is a great app that I highly recommend. At the start of yet another lockdown I decided I wanted to stay fit at home and so I tried this app. I did the 7x4 full body challenge and I love how the workouts there target all major muscle groups, how they get increasingly harder over time, and the ""personal coach"" feature which adjusts them according to your feedback. The results were indeed impressive. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I'm disappointed in the app now that the challenge is over. Working out every single day is not something I can keep up with indefinitely, so coming out of the 7x4 challenge I wanted to start a new routine where I work out 4 days of the week and I wanted it to be a more or less seamless transition from the last workout in the challenge. However, there are no other full body plans available and all the advanced plans have considerably fewer and easier workouts than the ones I had been doing towards the end of the challenge. They also can't be adjusted by your feedback. I subscribed to the premium plan thinking it would unlock a ""personal coach"" feature such as the one available in the challenge, but all it does is get rid of ads, which I'm okay with as they're not annoying (another plus point for the app). If they ever add a permanent full body plan that continuously adapts to your feedback and preferences, basically like the 7x4 challenge but without the commitment of doing it every single day and without a set end date, I will update my rating to 5 stars. I would even be willing to pay a premium subscription for this feature.",4
3283,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Good app but puzzling that it doesn't organise a sequence of different types of exercises. I started with the first one, a series of jumping jacks (I think they're called). Below that first exercise were more variants of the same exercise, jumping jacks. There was no prompt to move on to a different type of exercise. I'd still be doing jumping jacks if I hadn't exited the app! So, a good programme, but the way it works, unless I'm missing something, makes me feel I can't keep up from the start. Eventually I just stopped the programme. Compare that with the other app I use, which downloads a mix of yoga exercises which I know will take about 25 minutes to get though.",4
3284,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Overall a great app, really helping me keep in shape while sports are out, though I reckon the difficulty is too low in the advanced workouts, I recomend making them a bit more challenging or adding a higher level. I also think it would be good to add an option to create your own workouts, to choose the exersises you want in your plan and the amount.",4
3285,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I loved my first guided ab workout. But I can see these workouts becoming unbearable at higher levels, especially for older people, and especially due to individual body differences and limitations. For example, my legs are heavy so I barely made it through my second set of leg raises, but I can do the plank for 2+ minutes. So, a welcome feature would be to tweak the reps and rest periods for each exercise up to a certain point.",4
3286,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Just finished my 28 days challenge and I really enjoyed using this app, my only problem is that I can't seem to be able to switch from beginner to intermediate level... If I'm the person not seeing the right place to click, please let me know but if there's no option to switch, I'd suggest fixing that. Overall it's a great app that deserves an A+ grade üëçüèæüëçüèæüëçüèæ",4
3287,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Been using it for two years now and it's still my go to for workouts. It has an impressive collection that will quench whatever workout thirst you have. The only thing I think can be added to make it better is a dark mode. There's so much white that can be replaced, and dark mode will look even better with the already exisilting blue colour scheme.",4
3288,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Ok for beginners. The workout schedules are easy enough to follow, and they have little cartoon animation for every exercise. However, even the most advanced routines are way too low intensity for anyone who has some experience with bodyweight training. And the only way they make it harder is to add more reps, which gets pretty boring and ineffective at some point.",4
3289,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,The app is good and all but mine went mute on its own but was fixed in about 48hrs after I've reported the issue. So it's just great!!!,4
3290,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Great app, i have been using it for a couple of weeks and got noticably stronger. However I think a feature which would make it even better would be the ability to create your own schedule with the excersizes available in the app. So you could just toss together a programme and select how many pushups or whatever you want to do. Or you could create a goal for X amnount of pushups and it would build up to that instead",4
3291,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,I really love this app as it has so many exercises for free or those that can be accessed by watching an ad. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because of the function to make the workouts easier. I would love it if there were the option to change just one type of workout for an easier or harder one and keep the rest the same instead of switching up the whole routine.,4
3292,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Everything is great, thr interface is easy to use, I love the exercises, I just wish instead of fully reworking your schedule of exercises that I could remove one or two whichever I want and replace it with an exercise that's more fit for me, but if i say that the exercises I did were hard then it asks if I want to change them, I don't wanna fully change them, i just want to remove one or two out of the whole list. I hope there will be a feature like that in the future",4
3293,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"All is fine. The only problem so far is sync to Google fit: it looks like app sends data only for the last workout of the day, not all of them and not the summary data. And there is no way to correct the workout log in case you tried the complex and foud out it is not suitable for you at the moment, you will end up with <1 min. trainings in the log, better to be able to delete such a records directly in the app. Well done, thank you!",4
3294,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"However I genuinely appreciate your apps. They are perfectly fine example of a fitness training workout plans. Not just this every single app you've made but there is an problem in the screenshot you've uploaded in this app description the photo is ""before and after"" one. Any guy would guess that it is photoshopped very badly. Your app is too good. You don't have to post such pictures.",4
3295,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,It's a good work out app. But the full body plan doesn't include leg. I'll like you to include it in the next update.,4
3296,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Love the app, it's been so good to get a routine and go in from scratch, it's rewarding and I've seen real progress One problem, the differences between the workouts are too much! Easy chest is a little too easy, and chest intermediate is very very hard! I now through extra reps in and some of the intermediate exercises in, but they're not counted and reshuffling the difficulty would make this 5 stars",4
3297,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"This is one of the most comprehensive and good to go workout I can recommend to a body who what's to go for fitness and healthy life style when your Monday and Thursday fasting is included, I hope the developer will continue to develop it positively.",4
3298,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,It's good I think because who can't afford to go gym üèãüö¥üí™ so recommend you to try this app it's really help full to you,4
3299,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Great app for home-exercising! It's got just enough exercises on the free subscription to maintain my body between gym-days. The timer-system is good, and the instructions for each exercise. I like that you have the 'done'-button after certain reps, I can take my time to perfect technique instead of having to be ""fast"" with each rep. You can customise and keep track of your workouts easily, and the different levels of exercise (easy, moderate, hard) is great for progress and short-term goals!",4
3300,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,The workouts here are really incredible and suites the section you wanna train it's really incredible. But I'm giving 4 stars due to the ads but I'm good as long as they don't interrupt my training session,4
3301,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,I gave 4 stares because of the terms this app uses to describe how large you are in which may be offensive.,4

3310,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Best app for workout at home,4
3311,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"The workouts are generally good and require little to no equipment. I only wish it offered a finer-grained way to tailor the workouts to my abilities (beyond just rating how hard an entire workout was). For example, in the beginner ab workout, I've always felt that the leg raises are 100x harder than all the other exercises combined. The app tells me how to make some exercises easier--just not the one that is actually too hard for me.",4

3388,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Very good,4
3389,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Nice,4
3390,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,It makes me feel really good and also good because it's good for people who don't know how to get strong,4
3391,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"There should be an option to change what muscle group you want to focus on i.e full body, chest, arms, abs, legs. Instead I have to delete the app and change it. Otherwise, it's a vey good app",4
3392,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Works really well.. but sometimes you don't have more than 15-20 minutes to work out in the morning, and then it really doesn't help to gave 33 exercises. Please create the option for having shorter workout (but then more intensive perhaps)",4

3399,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Nice experience, you feel your body burning",4
3400,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"It's free, it's great, it actually works, it has animations to teach you how to do it and gives you tips you let you know how you would know if you are doing it wrong. Did I say it's free! It has a few ads that aren't intrusive. I wish it had a nutrition guide, too, since nutrition goes together with exercise. I am using it, and I m happy. This is beginner friendly 100%",5
3401,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"This app is amazing. I'm 13 turning 14 towards the end of this year. Free and great. One thing I would add is being able to make the workouts a little longer. (Im a new user, on the one after beginner. Forgot name üòÖ) Another thing I would add is being able to select your age. Not saying that there hard. Just that I feel like it would be able to choose harder workouts ( And the other way around.) Also at the beginning when it asks how much pushups you can do, there should be an option to do more",5
3402,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"After using this app for a year now, I have to say it breaks down workouts in the best way. It makes it convenient to do a workout anywhere, especially when traveling. I use a lot different workouts to keep it challenging and there are plenty of options here. I also appreciate how customizable it is to your needs as you become more fit.",5
3403,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I haven't tried an app like this onez but I really do like it. Just the right exercise lengths, good information, I like that it includes stretches, the daily routine is varied which avoids boredom and allows your muscles time to recover. I like that you can raise up or down the challenge. I do wish there was a tutorial mode however. To give you more detailed instructions during the routine. A few exercises are not intuitive and it's hard to remember when to breathe and which muscle to flex.",5
3404,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I have been using this app for over 3 years and I am so grateful for it!! It has EVERYTHING . From stretches to workouts at every level...and if you do everything right you WILL see results .. other than some adds its perfect .. it's gotten me the strongest I've been . Amd completely balanced . Since it has separate work outs for different muscles . Consistency should be put in from your end. And if you want more you can add weights in, just wish there was more back work outs!!",5
3405,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"After following the programs for a year, I've seen more than noticeable results. I love how they change the difficulty depending on how you think it felt like. If you're trying to have a simple program to follow for free, then this is it. (Only thing that could be annoying are the ads, but even then they don't push at your face and are really subtle with it.)",5
3406,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I love the fact that their main exercises are free and you can purchase extra premium exercises if you want to. All the other apps I've tried you have to pay for a subscription, but for those of us who are looking for a free or cheaper option, this app is awesome and the free exercises are great! They're hard, but you can make them easier or harder, depending on what level you are in your fitness regimen. This is a great fitness app & I NEVER give 5 stars, but I'm giving this app 5 stars!",5
3407,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Update: it has been 6 months since I started using the app and it has continued to be great. The minor visual update is great too. Thank you! Great so far! This app is ad supported when free or you can pay to remove the ads and use it with some other benefits. I will likely pay for it as some point as I greatly appreciate the options and implementation. The ads aren't too obtrusive and the content great. Will likely stick with this app for a long time if first impressions are to be trusted.,5
3408,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I've been using this and other Leap fitness apps. I enjoy the premium feature, being rid of the ads is great and so is the price. Not bad, watching videos, trying to keep up with the instructor to exercise is not the most productive of activities... I find myself starting over regularly. I find there are some flaws to the app, but if you're trying to be honest especially technologically, it shouldn't be an issue.",5
3409,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Real good, no equipment required. There is a pay wall but it doesn't block the basics and you get good functionality without paying. There are many diagrams and written instructions so you have to physically not have eyes to not know what you're doing. My only grievance is that the arm workout is more stretching but hey, what else can you do without equipment. If you make the stretching active stretching it still works. Google what that means if you don't understand.",5
3410,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"This review is for the older app version. (2019-2021). I emphasize this because when I tried downloading the new version on my new 2023 phone I realized they had ""updated"" the app with subscriptions and other online typ functions which actually don't work for me. I live in the countryside and have bad reception. I just need a staight foward and structured routine to keep track of my schedule and progress. The old app provides that reliably because it works offline and without interruptions.",5
3411,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"This app is great. It really helped me get into the groove of muscle training. There are a few downsides, but none of them are major. Sometimes the exercises can be a bit difficult to properly perform, even with the app's instructions. Also, I'm not entirely sure which exercise sets I should pick for certain purposes. After doing the upper body challenge, I'm not entirely sure where to go next. But I seem to be figuring it out as I go, so it probbaly won't be much of an inconvenience in the end.",5
3412,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I'm really enjoying this app. It's easy to use, and I've seen some great progress with it. Edit: I've dropped over 30+ lbs since March 2023. I'm changing from 4 Stars to 5. The issue I had with the reset isn't really anything to complain about. I've noticed a good psychology to it that has helped me to see how far I've come. When I reset, yes it's far too easy, but thinking back to the beginning, I struggled with the easiest routines. I've thoroughly enjoyed the app and will continue to use it.",5
3413,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I like this app a lot. The only time I ever see an ad, is after the entire workout is over. That's it. No ads when moving anywhere, and no ads when opening the app either. I also don't have to sign in to anything either when I do decide to work out, which I also like a lot (don't use Ganbaru because of the sign-in stuff). To me, this app is just no-nonsense, straightforward exercise, which I think is what I need. It's free too, which I am grateful for considering the quality of the app. 21/10",5
3414,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"It's straight forward makes just the right workout great for muscle building and no ads untill the end of the workout and only takes 10 to 30 minutes for the workout. There is no glitches that I know of either with makes this perfect especially for someone using an android, (where there are constant glitches). I hope this inspire you",5
3415,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I bought their one year subscription back in July and it was a wonderful experience as it truly helped me lose weight and develop a consistent workout routine. However in the beginning of September I was downgraded back to the basic version and after multiple contacts to their customer service, I've yet to receive a respond. I've decided to give up on this app and cut my losses as it truly feels like a rip off but I'm still appreciative of the 30 pounds I lost because of it. üí™üèæ",5
3416,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"So far after 5 days I'm feeling great! I'm doing the 4x7 full body challenge, and while it started off very easy it is customizable. After my workout I'm asked to rate it on a scale of difficulty and if I'd like it to be easier or harder next time. There are some ads, but they do not appear during your workout, and for what you're getting they are basically non existent. So far 10/10 I would definitely recommend! Also, one of the advertisements has lead me to one of my other new favorite apps!",5
3417,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"A very nice workout experience. Unlike many other workout apps, this one didn't interrupt my session with ads. The voice helped with my form and made the challenge real. Any tips for people who want to try the workouts this app has to offer: dedication, discipline, and determination. If I had known that this app had existed three months ago, I may very well be at my prime.",5
3418,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Straight forward, good beginner exercises with stretching. One ad at the end of a whole routine. NON-INTUSIVE. I can't stress this enough. The ads are so acceptable. I HATE ads, can't stand them. I've barely noticed these. I've done the 4 beginner routines for a week now and hove no complaints. It offers reminders if you're into that sort of thing and the calendar and workout history are perfect for a beginner looking to build consistency.",5
3419,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,The app is great. The 28 day challenge transformed my body ! The variety of exercise keep things interesting. If I didn't understand an exercise there are written instructions and video links for each so they can be properly executed. Everything can be adjusted for an easier or more challenging work out. The history log keeps me motivated and allows me to hold myself accountable. Minimal add placement and never in the middle of a work out.,5
3420,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"This is a really slick app and has effectively gotten me back into home workouts. I feel motivated to keep doing it. The scaling is also really slick if thing are too hard or too easy. I haven't looked yet but it would be nice if they had a space to add home workout equipment like dumbbells, bands, etc to add to the workout options. The ads a bit invasive wish I could just pay to remove the ads.",5
3421,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"App crashes after each workout. It does not remain open to put in our weight or how we feel. Please fix. Edit: I've never really used it before as much as I currently am due to quarantine. After a recent update, the app runs better. In the rare incident that the app does crashes now, just reload with airplane mode. This app has helped me increase my stamina and strength remarkably better than I anticipated. Shout out to the team that Incorporates the features. After every workout: Hulk smash!!",5
3422,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Great at home work out app! Been using it for a few years now and I have no complaints. I canceled all gym/workout fees and use this app in addition to an elliptical machine or outside running when weather allows. Has reminder settings, custom work out regimes, easy/intermediate/hard levels, among many other features. I use the commercial version and it only plays one commercial at the end of each work out session, not a huge deal. I love it and will continue to use it!",5
3423,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Ads can be somewhat ill timed. When you select a workout an ad will, at times, pop up before bringing up your selection. I have ADHD so getting motivation is difficult to manage. So when I have it and I need to jump right in, the extra wait from an unexpected ad can kill my momentum. Otherwise, the app is great. Workouts are great. Easy to navigate.",5
3424,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I'm just starting with the app but so far everything is working correctly, easy to use and understand. I am taking the little extra time first to review the exercises, watch the video and listen to their information,and am comfortable going into each exercise. I haven't seen it yet, but as a mental note on my first day, I skipped the last 2 exercises but will go back throughout the day to hit them. It's synced easily with Google ,o hopefully,there is a way to record in 1 place or the other.",5
3425,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Finally, an app that isn't just some overhyped insubstantial marketing BS, and actually has a practical and useful impact on a person's tangible life! Now that I am in my 40s, it is important to take ease of injury and adjustable performance into account. This app transforms what are usually boring home calisthenic workouts into engaging, compact, practical, efficient, guided, and encouraging body weight routines. It incorporates stretching, something which I have always overlooked, but which makes a huge difference in how I feel upon completing the workout. it tracks every possible piece of data you could need tracked, though it does not obligate you to use that part of it. This is as simple and straightforward as It gets. Turn it on. Do what it says. Improve your health and the overall quality of your life.",5
3426,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Simply excellent. Great exercise level for a beginner like me, visual and audio instructions, a rest timer with a simple option to add more time if needed, doesn't overload you, and offers the option to set up reminders to keep you on track without being obnoxious or i trusive. The ads on the free version are tasteful, and aimed at self improvement, at least for me, and are bringing up options I like, but would not have considered. 2 days in, I feel pleasantly sore, but not crippled, just enough",5
3427,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"The best bodyweight app hands down. I've searched for a no equipment workout app and this one has everything I'm looking for. There are only a few adds one before and one after the workout or to earn extra. The free version, without the extras, is great as is. The coach has an robot voice but it became a running joke for me and dosen't bother me too much. Her reminders are actually helpful.",5
3428,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"OK, so I think this app was made just for me! I just finished my very first ab workout. It was a wonderful guided experience (if you choose to keep the audio on). I appreciated the breaks in between each exercise, which made me feel like I was accomplishing my task with ease. Also, there are commercials or adds but THEY DO NOT INTERFERE WITH YOUR WORKOUT and they are VERY SHORT. I feel very confident that if I stick with the offerings of this app I will have results that I can be proud of.",5
3429,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I really like this app because the controls are really easy to use and the simplicity is really comforting. they have a range of workouts depending on difficulty and time too which is nice if I'm busy or can't handle a lot or if I want to do a lot. there aren't many ads either except for when you finish a workout or if you're trying to do a premium workout in which case you just have to watch a 30 second ad if you don't want to buy premium. overall, it's a really good app.",5
3430,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Just completed the full body 28 days challenge. I can feel the results but not see it very well. But this app has made exercising so easy, even through days where you want to quit, it just gives you something to do, plain and simple. Pushups have gotten easier but they're still hard. One thing though, can we get an upper body section too? Instead of trying full body everytime, I would like to do upper body and lower body on alternating days, so my legs get some more love too. Stay motivated!",5
3431,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Great app for working out without all the gym equipment. There are three levels to choose from in the different areas of the body that you want to work on. There is also an option to work on the whole body. After each exercise the app will ask you to rate the exercise plan too easy, a little easy, a little hard, too hard or just right and then it will adjust your next exercise session accordingly.",5
3432,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Effective, simple workouts. I wanted to see if there was some sort of program that would be effective. Lo and behold, I found this one. It offers targeted workouts as well as full body. Along with that, there are different levels you can select- beginner, intermediate, and expert. The workouts can be tailored a bit further even beyond that within the options. It also offers daily/motivational reminders, throughout the day. These can be turned off. Can sync w\ Google fit.",5
3433,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I absolutely love this app! Not only is it free to use, but it offers me a diverse array of options to help me get in shape. They also have a huge amount of different workouts. This app also does advertisements right! So many apps nowadays flood your experience with ads. This app regulates the number of advertisements you see making the experience faster, easier, and more helpful.",5
3434,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"great for beginners who are mildly athletic but no real muscle or build. the app coaches you through the exercises and points out common mistakes in form as youre doing the exercise, super helpful. it can set reminders which ive used to get motivated and keep myself on track. not a fan of the ads after each workout but definitely a small price for what you get. some of the exercises are very difficult if you arent used to them. i was not a fan of leg raises at first. lol",5
3435,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Perfect. Very useful and easy to use. Everything is ok, but if there is auto counting for workout steps in each round it was better. Same as Dumbble workout app that count each move. So we don't need come back to phone after each round and hit ""Done"" button or etc then go to next eorkout! The best way is that one option that allow user to turn on or off auto counting workout moves. Thanks Dev team",5
3436,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,I really like the app. It has been an excellent tool for training at home. One small thing I would like is if there was a week challenge that did a total full body split. The current one is all upper body and so I have to alternate between it and the lower body challenge to get a full body weekly challenge. A second small thing thats missing is the ability to change reps on the workout. Sometimes can do more or cant do the full and itd be handy to record that so that can better see progress.,5
3437,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I don't go to gyms as a rule, so this app is right up my ally. After completing week one, not consecutive either, I feel more strength and energy than I had before. I also have a bad back and neck and after a couple days of consecutive work outs I feel the pain diminishes to a completely manageable level, being almost nothing as opposed to what I'm used to. I would definitely recommend this app.",5
3438,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I appreciate that this program ensures I hit all the muscle groups. I also like learning new exercises - there are nice written instructions and video demonstrations. I usually reach a failure point in each exercise session - which makes me really feel like I'm pushing myself. Overall, very satisfied. I feel better, and I look better.",5
3439,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"It really doesn't get more simple than this. Turn on the app, find what you want to target and get after it. This app does have some yoga but does wonders when thrown into a cycle of yoga and cardio. I've never had an app take feedback and adjust the routine so seamlessly. (the app itself asks and adjusts accordingly. Would highly recommend to anyone that may be hesitant to go to a gym, or is struggling to find a rhythm.",5
3440,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Incredible app! I am shredded because of it. Two suggestions though: 1. Allow a custom workout maker where you can choose and arrange different exercises. 2. Please make a separate chest app or put all the different apps together(abs arms, etc.). I just want some variation in the exercises for the muscle groups that don't have their own app.",5
3441,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Have used this app for years to maintain a basic fitness level. Contains a variety of bodyweight moves to target different areas like abs, arms, and legs. Also has a range of pre-workout stretching and HIIT exercises as well. Definitely recommend for building basic fitness or at home workout. There is a progression for Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. Definitely follow that suggestion! Only wish is that they would add more unique exercises or incorporate different movements into routines.",5
3442,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,This app has excellent uses for a person that is either just starting out with their fitness goals or for ones that are trying to build themselves back up. It can be hard for a person to start over again after a long lull and it can be very discouraging. The 7x4 beginner's program is a great option that gives you a decent yet quick workout that you can accomplish without breaking your heart lol. Definitely worth the download.,5
3443,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Outstanding app. Some ads, but just before and after the workout. Very well organized, explained and effective workouts, without equipment! I am seriously considering interrupting my gym subscription. The app proposes full-body challenges, as well as programs devoted to abs, or arms, or backs + shoulders, or chest, or legs. Each of these programs is very well designed, and the full-body ones even vary from day to day. (It would be great if those for specific body parts did too.) 5++ stars.",5
3444,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Even though this is my first workout app I've ever used, I still find it to be the best one out there. It's easy to select exercise, your workouts are logged automatically, and there's a large variety to choose from. It got me back into a structured workout routine, and in just two sessions of a chest workout, I'm already noticing a huge difference. The ads are also not annoying, very surprising for a free app. Highly recommend to anyone and everyone, already told my friends about it. 10/10 üëç",5
3445,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I recently started using this workout app and I am blown away by its amazing features! The app is very user-friendly and easy to navigate. The interface is visually appealing and motivating, making me excited to start my workouts. One of the best things about this app is the variety of workouts that it offers. Plus, the workouts are customizable based on my fitness level and goals, so I can always find a workout that challenges me and helps me progress towards my goals.",5
3446,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Tried doing the upper body and lower body routine 28 day challenge, and it was a great experience. The first 3 days all of my body was sore (haven't worked out in months). It targets certain parts of your body every day and gets more intense as days pass. Even has descriptions, gifs, and video examples in case there's confusion. I learned alot of different stretches and workouts to add to my own custom routine. And this was only 1 part of the app. Also the ads are so unintrusive!",5
3447,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Starting rehab after losing a leg and multiple abdominal surgeries to fix injuries received in combat. This app gives me extra motivation to keep pushing through the pain. It also keeps me accountable by tracking my progress. It's not the be all, end all for fitness, but it's keeping me active and interested... something that is incredibly hard for me at this moment. I'm sure I'll get better again as I shake off the rust, but till then? This does the trick.",5
3448,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"So far I love it. I have full on excercised in almost 10 years. Ive been post military screw that noise for almost a decade. Im getting older and ready to get into shape. This app is fantastic for getting back into it. Rest when it says, picture guides for the workouts, skip omit of its too much. Only has ads at the beginning and end of the work out. Once the beginner work outs get easy, i think i might purchase the premium plan. 8 to 15 mins a day and so well organized. Cant beat it.",5
3449,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I find it extremely user friendly and fast. I've had many apps that allow selections and progressive use but this app has ran the smoothest of them. I'm not sure how the algorithm decides your routine but my first use was only a bitdifficult and i think that may have been due to outside (from the app) influence. It is my first day using this and i hope to re-evaluate when i've become more fit and have had a better grasp of the app itself. As of now though, very good in my opinion.",5
3450,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I was skeptical of this home workout app, given that it doesn't have you use any machinery, and I am just skeptical of home workouts anyways. But boy was I wrong, they have voice guides, pictures, etc to help you through the workout. They customize a workout for you based on your body type, weight, goals, etc. I am definitely a fan of this app. The app is easy to use and has a nice rest feature.",5
3451,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I feel like the robotic voice is disappointed in my effort so it's really motivating to push harder. Reminds me of my dad with the lack of enthusiasm in my activities. Very well done. But seriously, it does a good job speaking the commands so you don't have to get up after every action and can lay there in your own self pity a little longer. Very nice feature.",5
3452,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Nice app it won't disappoint you if you're trying to change yourself into becoming a muscle machine lol I recommend it for anyone who's trying to change their lives around for the better it's easy to use easy to work with and easy to finish off the day with. You just need dedication to make yourself improve for you and the app will do the rest for you try it out!,5
3453,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I really love this app the workouts are simplified and are customized to your fitness level. I hate feeling exhausted after a workout. The workouts in this app are not too strenuous and are just perfect. Also dislike doing the same workouts over and over again. The workouts in the app varies each day and makes it more fun and not feel routine. Absolutely love the app, the developers did a excellent job on this. Props to the development team. üòé üòÅ üôÉ",5
3454,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,It's a good workout app I liked the daily workout though some moves like the pike push ups were kinda strange but I have tried all three of the programs ( Beginners. Intermediate. And advanced. ) all were good. And I would say compared to others this workout is really good no matter what program you are doing and they are quite quick and can easily be simplified with the video option if you dont know how to do it,5
3455,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"The best workout app I've ever used. Gives really good no equipment workouts for whichever part of your body you want to focus on. Ads play after each workout, but putting your phone on airplane mode solves that problem. The workouts themselves are very good, they come in 3 levels, beginner, intermediate, and advanced. All of them are scaled very well to their respective levels of intensity. Overall this is definitely a 5 star app!",5
3456,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I've only been using the app for about a week, but I already love it. it's really comprehensive. It covers every area really well and makes me feel like I'm actually getting progress on my workouts. It keeps track of everything for you. you just have to put in the details. I really like the varying levels of difficulty and that you choose what you work on. there's even an alarm. my only issue can't be helped. The BMI index can't tell fat from muscle. No app can do that, so it generalizes.",5
3457,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Great to stay on track while at home. I'm doing a few of the different challenges on their apps all at once to stay active while on shelter in place. Good reminders and each one is just around 10-15min (full body, lower body and then planks/splits on other apps from the same creators). There are lots of ads, but I think it is worth it for all the content.",5
3458,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Showed me a bunch of excersises I never realized I needed before, which is good because I feel my overall strength and tone is improving. I'm doing 30 day challenge, 7 days in, no leg exercises yet? I didn't explore the app enough to know if this a specific muscle group, so far it's been upper body and abs. Still like it though because they explain quick and simple, while your doing it, what to look out for. Also, if the animated diagram isn't enough, there is a short video for detail.",5
3459,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I hate working out for i never know what to do i also dislike working out infront of other people. This app is perfect. Adjustable workouts, can be done anywhere, and with the options of difficulties it allows me to, when im ready, to take it up several botches in increase or decrease my workout. Best part is it takes 5-20min per workout. I have recommended this to several friends already.",5
3460,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I have been using this app for 2 months now. I chose this app because I wanted a free app and did not mind advertising, I wanted it to be simple and no frills, and I wanted it to work with minimal buy-in. This app met all those expectations. There are ads, but they never last more than 30 seconds between workouts. The workouts are very well balanced and target precisely what they claim to balance and the animations and voices do not engage in anything more than what I think is necessary for a virtual exercise coach (offering alternatives to difficult exercises or ideas for making easier exercises more intense). I used Full Body Challenge, Lower Body Challenge, and Beginner HIIT Belly Fat which takes between 40 and 50 minutes and I am more than satisfied.",5
3461,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I am using this for half of the year, and really improved my body. But at current version I cant make training harder, it just not allow me to do it at some level, could you remove this limitation please? I mean, I already easy do 20 push-ups after last 4 week challenge, why I should restart it with 12. It would be just easier to keep track with app, not count in mind how much I should do. button to make it harder just disabled. Also it would be great to adjust if training harder or longer",5
3462,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Just started using the app. What I like about this app is that the plans can be made harder or more relaxed depending on individual ability. This flexibility is useful to people like me who is returning to a workout plan after a loooong break or even first time triers, to not give up right after the first few attempts. I will keep using it and report back after a month.",5
3463,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I don't think this can get any better! there are not ads during my workout. there are a perfect amount of stretching/working out. and even when your done there is a 5 percent chance an ad pops up! Even if so, it will only be two secs Really good app, recommend if you want to improve and get healthier!",5
3464,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"So far, the app has been very useful. I just have one suggestion for the next update. Please include the option of manually logging exercises in the app, apart from the fixed workout plans. For instance, if I do a set of squats or push-ups additionally, I want to be able to log it in the app separately. It would also be great if there was a weekly or monthly statistic showing the proportion of muscles targetted or the calories burnt. These would be very useful features to have.",5
3465,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"the exercise was a little complicated since I am a beginner but I could feel it working, and it is cooperative, even for a automated system, letting you take breaks, add time to them and pause options. I highly recommend it.",5
3466,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"The home workout app provides a convenient fitness solution. With a user friendly interface and diverse exercise routines, it caters to various fitness levels. Engaging workouts, progress tracking, and customizable plans make it a valuable tool for achieving fitness goals at home. An effective blend of simplicity and functionality.",5
3467,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Great app for people who want to work out at home with no weights and it free it's amazing and exactly what I was looking for! Please keep it free and up to date the ads are annoying but if it keeps it free I'm fine with that.,5
3468,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I am under 21 and for those who are above 21, I can confidently say that this app will not work for you. Despite seeing the negative and positive reviews of this app, I consistently used this app for 30 days and I was able to show visible results. I won't say that I got a well defined sharp jawline but it tended towards a sharp jawline(not so defined yet not so bad too). I would recommend this app for those who can consistently perform this exercises and also chew gum thrice days and also >21",5
3469,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Great interface, the bifurcation for respective departments of body to work on is fabulous. Also, the inclusion of exercise guidelines with the YT addressal is phenomenal. Great going, Developers and The Fitness Team!",5
3470,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Really impressive: You can find exercises for all your muscles for free. An you can unlock the premium work-outs watching a 30-second ad but more than all was really astonished with the efficienty of exercises.,5
3471,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,easy to understand and use and very systematic as well as experience based app I ever used. but I do love if it have automatic method to skip to the next level (from exercise to rest).,5
3472,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I'm 2 weeks in doing the full body work-out. I found it difficult for a while, but I found you can adjust the exercises in the settings to make it easier. I'm really enjoying the work-outs and I can feel and see the difference in my body. I combine the exercises with a daily walk. I've had to adjust my diet as I got very hungry after the work-out.",5
3473,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"The exercises are perfect for each and every person using. Not that it is bad but I suggest that the exercises made should be based on the user's BMI edited result so it can also be fit for both men , women and children. although, the exercises are good and not over vigorous for users. I think there should also be a warning to people who are not workout freeks and don't cope well with vigorous exercise to not download this app or make suitable training for them. Thank you",5
3474,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I completely underestimated the effectiveness of the arms exercises but it turned out to be a proper workout... looking forward to my progress after the first month so I can really judge accurately if it works for me or not. So far, it's good though.",5
3475,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Good app. However, voice instructions are a bit chopped. It would be nice to have the possibility to workout with locked screen and control the app with earphones or something.",5
3476,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,It has been a great experience using this app for free. The best part of it is the question at the end of each work out to know if it was too hard or easy or just OK for you and then they adjust up or down based on your complaint or feedback. I love it!,5
3477,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,The workouts are tailored according to your physique and there are options to make the plan harder or easier as per your feedback. It is a good app which will definitely help you in your journey to get fit.,5
3478,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,This is an amazing app I've been using it for about a year or two and have almost built my full body its total free which is the best part is that it's free this app works for anybody that's a hard Gainer needs to build muscle or stays in shape or needs to lose some weight shout out to the people that made this and they're amazing,5
3479,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Great app best part is that is free and if you find a workout hard it will make an easier plan for you. Based on your end goal there are workout plans. Thanks to the team. You are making impact.,5
3480,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,The app works so good. On my first day of working out it was hard. But you are able to change the hardness lower. Overall I think it is a good app to use when you workout.,5
3481,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Never been one for going to the gym, and I found travel time and lack of knowledge made it even harder to be motivated to workout. Just a week using this and I'm more motivated to workout than I've ever been. Clear instructions coupled with an estimated time for the set, make doing the exercises easy and finding the time a snap. Helps that you don't need any equipment either!",5
3482,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"When I used the app for the first time, I found the setup and how we must do the workouts very simple and detailed. The workouts were great, the app keeps track of your progress everyday, It even keeps track if your getting healthy, unhealthy, or underweight. I 100% recommend using this app if you want to self improve your Mind and body. Excellent App üëåüåüüíØ.",5
3483,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Been using it for a week now, and it is a great app with a really good UI and the notifications is a great feature, especially with you being able to set the time of the reminder. I like how it has verbal commands whilst doing the exercises, which help so you don't have to look at your phone every 30 seconds, overall great app, although I have seen people saying that when you reach the end of your workout plan, it does get annoying to use, I havent seen this yet though",5
3484,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Pretty easy to use,contains adds but don't pop up inbetween only at the end or starting, effective exercises and great results. Thank you team for your wonderful service. Note- adds are getting a bit problamatic",5
3485,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Though there are adverts, I understand it's to keep the app going for all of us. Suitable for all stages of folks who are looking to step up from their current physique. Features includes animated trainers on the how to execute the reps, timers and counters so you can focus on mimicking the trainer video only. Most of all, save $$ on gym classes and trainers!!",5
3486,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Pretty great. Four days ago I couldn't do a single pushup and now I can do almost 10 before feeling weak. This app actually helped me stick to exercising daily which is hard for me. It offers help for weight loss and building muscle by having you do Yoga and basic exercises, like jumping Jacks. Overall I feel greatful I downloaded this in the first place.",5
3487,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"The fact that it gives an option to do additional exercises if you watch an ad, I'm so happy. I thought it'd just be a paywall but you put an ad option too. Heck, I'd watch 5 ads just to support you. Happy holidays, team!",5
3488,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I can't believe this app is FREE! IT WORKS SMOOTHLY (unlike the paid BetterMe app that hangs everytime). It also allows me to really customize the difficulty level, before AND after each workout, to make the next workup easier or harder. That feature is REALLY great as it simulates have a coach providing real-time feedback. And for me to use three REALLY, means this app is REALLY (fourth) awesome. Improvement: if the app can tell me the duration of my routine, that will REALLY be the bomb. Tq!!",5
3489,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Great App for working out at home. Best results from using it is achieved through consistency. I have been using it since the start of the pandemic in 2020 and receiving good benefits. I have not yet out grown the App so if I need better results, the App has higher levels and allows for more exercising in a given session. Overall, I am happy with it. Thank you to the team that created it.",5
3490,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I definetly find it very useful and user-friendly also beginner freindly. Also the exercises recommended here includes few of the yogasan's as well which literally frees the body and refresh itself for whole day. Seriously I couldn't be more thankful. Few ads definetly pop up after you finish exercises and once you start the app but that's fine by me because they are providing the service for free. But I humbly request don't increase the number of ads, beginning and end is fine. ""JUST RIGHT"".",5
3491,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Great app. I got a 6 pack after doing 19 of its advanced lessons, and the workouts were good. You can make them harder if you want or easier if you need them to be. üëåüèº",5
3492,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"Nothing comes easy, more so when it comes to weight loss and fitness but this App makes your journey more enjoyable. It tailors fitness exercises based on your needs needs and progress. Even though it's not always easy to consistently use the App everyday because life does happen, you get reminders for your daily workout and you can always continue where you left off on your fitness plan should you miss a day. I use this App in combination with road running; i have increased energy!",5
3493,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,I've been using this app for 3 months and I love the new UI but I wish there was a way to boost the voice of the coach because I can't hear it while listening to music but it's an overall great app and I definitely recommend it. I doesn't record the full time that my workout takes. It's usually lesser than half of the time actually it takes like for a workout that took me 28 minutes it shows that it took 11 minutes and 4 seconds. Also the voulme problem is so annoying.,5
3494,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Super application! It certainly helps me getting fitter. I started to use it in the middle of September when I was able to do only 1 pushup. 1 and a half months later I am doing 10 thanks for their 7x4 Full Body Challenge program. Currently I am using their 7x4 Lower Body Challenge. It would be great to see more of these challenges as they are really motivating. But they have a great variety of trainings to select from so I am really happy with this app!,5
3495,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,Great app for doing a home workout. Especially how you can change settings and make it easieror more dofficult depending on your needs. I recommend it to everyone.,5
3496,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,I'm getting into a good daily workout and this app helps so much. Takes the thinking out of the workout and it's so helpful when the workouts are based on using your own body weight.,5
3497,homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment,"I'm not understanding. There's millions of grown men who don't won't to work out. Yet I'm on only 15, and I'm way bulked than an average 20 yr old. This app helped me a lot. I saw progress within 1 week. I HIGHLY recommend getting this app. Definitely a 5‚≠ê",5

They are quick to give you a 15 dollar penalty for not being able to process the card though.

If you don't receive this link in a timely manner, we recommend creating a new mobile app account and that should do the trick.""  Really?

3824,com.planetfitness,"More like 2 1/2 stars. The app is ok, but for me mainly using it for tracking my workout, I'm not 100% sure how to log in what I want. It doesn't give instruction on anything. In the Workout Type section, I think it would be better to have the list of equipment in the Workout Type section instead of just random sports listed and for each equipment used, just put in whatever is applicable: distance, time spent, reps, or weight. At the end, just give the amount of calories used automatically.",2
3825,com.planetfitness,"This would be a decent app, but just from trying it out a little bit, there's a major problem that I can see if you want to use the free workouts and activity tracker. There is no way to preview the workouts. If you use, for example, a YouTube workout video instead, you can click ahead to any point in the video and get a glimpse of everything the workout involves. With the Planet Fitness workouts, if you click on any workout to open it up, it will automatically start you on the workout. No skipping ahead to see what it has (although on the side it has a view that shows you what the next couple of exercises are, but you cannot preview the whole thing). The app assumes you are doing the workout while it's playing, so whenever you exit the workout, it adds it to your activity tracker, and I can find no way to delete that automatically-added workout from your activity tracker. So if you're trying to track your workouts and calories, looking at any workout videos will mess that all up. They don't seem to understand some people may want to see what a workout video contains before they choose a workout to do. They need to add an option to preview and skip through the workout like a regular video, and it should definitely ask after going through a workout if you want to add it to your activity tracker, not just add it automatically with no way to remove it. On another topic, I think it's wrong for Planet Fitness to require you to have the app. I always had a key tag that I used to check in with at the gym, but when mine broke and can't go on my keychain anymore, I was told they aren't doing key tags anymore because of the pandemic, and you can only check in with the app. That doesn't make sense. A key tag doesn't hurt anyone because, just like the app, the member just holds it up to be scanned to check in. The member does not hand the key tag to the employee to check them in. It's also really annoying when companies assume you want to take up space on your phone with their damn app. There are way too many apps out there for us as people to be able to add apps to our phone for everything; therefore, apps should be optional, not a requirement in order to use a service. It also seems a bit discriminatory because not everyone who belongs to a $10-a-month gym is going to even own a smartphone or own one that has enough space to keep adding apps. I thought I would check out the workouts to see if I might actually get some use out of the app since I was forced to get it, but nope, it's totally illogical how it works for reasons I stated earlier. Does not inspire me to use it.",2

It might have great tutorials and other things but I'm not interested in those at the state in my journey.

3862,com.planetfitness,At least you can now input calories manually but the app is still garbage. Example. You can only input speed in .5 mph increments but the machines work in .1 mph increments. And since you can't manually enter distance it's wrong because the speed can't be set correctly. The developers have clearly never worked out in their lives.,2
3863,com.planetfitness,I like that I can pull up my barcode for checking in and that I can schedule workout classes. I don't like that it doesn't link the classes to my activity monitor. It doesn't even have the exercises we do available to manually enter. The Life Fitness equipment have barcodes but the app is separate from Planet Fitness so that doesn't link to my activity monitor either. Some of the types if equipment are available to manually enter but not all of them. This app needs work. Going back to Fitbit.,2
3864,com.planetfitness,The App already sucks and I just downloaded it. I don't have a previous account with planet fitness so I clicked the option to create account. I enter my information the correct email and a brand new password. I press create and get an error message. A non specific error message with no other option then to press okay. Somebody I'd appreciate if you reach out and aid me in this issue or I'll just sign up for a different gym.,2
3865,com.planetfitness,"This app is only good for tracking workouts for the cardio machines(and I'm not even sure it has all of them). It would be nice if I could keep a workout journal of the weight machines, or have the ability to scan the QR codes on the machines. I don't need to track 'skiing - downhill' on a Planet Fitness app unless they put a ski hill in one lmao. So basically I have to use another tracking app and this is annoying, but I can scan my card and get PT points so it's got that going for it I guess",2

Like filing a report about this error. I cant do anything on the app.,2
3867,com.planetfitness,Slow and kind of useless. The crowd meter is dumb bc it doesn't really give you an idea of how busy it is. No percentage or number of members that are there. It also just feels like there's too much going on for what I want in the app; which is just touch less check in and crowd meter. It took about 50 tries to even get my membership connected because it kept giving me an error.,2
3868,com.planetfitness,I paid my bill on the website and then the app charged me a second time. Was told it would take up to 8 weeks to get a refund. Unacceptable. It didn't take 8 weeks to receive my payment. Should not take 8 weeks to reverse the charge. Also can't sign into the website on a computer with my password though I've reset my password.

4000,com.planetfitness,"The app seems pretty straightforward and has a lot of good content on it. I don't particularly use any of it but I looked at it and it seems okay. My main gripe is that you're basically forced to have the app to check in. It has a crowd meter that supposedly tells you how busy your selected gym is but it seems pretty inaccurate to me. I just left the gym and it was packed and the ""crowd meter"" said it was only 3/10 where I would assume it was more around 6/10 at least.",3

One notch in the meter could mean a half filled parking lot to a full parking lot. 3 notches out of 10 and the entire parking lot is full, and the gym itself appears to be (roughly) 85-90% capacity.

Lastly, enable users to design a workout routine in the app. I think your app team could easily do all these in a month. Thanks",3

4455,com.planetfitness,So I'm impressed with the new version of the Planet Fitness app I have had some trouble booking classes so I had to take one star off it just for that problem. If I can make a feature suggestion though I think it would be cool if this would sync with Google fit and keep track of my calories. I think this apps definitely worth having.,4
4456,com.planetfitness,Please add features! Something like a my favorites section where you can save a lineup of PF workouts. There's so much good content but no way to bookmark it! Also can there be noise added to the timers on the workouts?? It's not very functional to workout and look at the screen for the 30 sec count downs. Thank you,4
4457,com.planetfitness,I like the app but the new upgrades I don't like. Its hard to schedule session with club for training. The session tab used to be on main page. Now you have to go in and find it and its not easy to find. The updates just happened this past week. Help!!!,4
4458,com.planetfitness,crowd meter is not accurate. maybe have people check out too?,4
4459,com.planetfitness,"The app is easy and simple to use, I like how it works. The only thing I wish was different is being able to see what trainer you will be getting ahead of scheduling a class.

Apart from that I think the app is good.",4
4460,com.planetfitness,"I like the app, but there's always room for improvement. May I suggest you add a special announcements page that can generate notifications to mobile devices. It would be useful to notify users of unexpected closures, specials, new workouts etc.",4

I could be because since I switched gyms the online system at the gym desk shows my membership number has expired. This is to spite seeing a new contract upload on my personal dashboard AND continued billing from Planet Fitness. Would love not to leave negative feedback, but it's my only choice as there is no feedback location on their regular web site or a number to call",4
4462,com.planetfitness,"I think it is a good app. Useful in keeping track of exercise, but would like it better if it included more types of exercise, like housework to be measured by ""light to moderate to heavy"" instead of mile measurement only. So far, I like it! easy to use.",4
4463,com.planetfitness,"I like the app so far, but it's not as user friendly as you'd think - example (at least on my android) I'd think the tracker would be closer to the top for one click instead of having to scroll down a bit to find it... or, as with my man, having to click on top right button when entering the gym to get to the scan with his huge fingers was not as easy for him as it is for me... I'd also like to see more activities added to the outside of gym options - I'm spoiled perhaps, but I'd think Planet Fitness would have the same or similar list to others that have things listed we do at home that should/could be counted for activity if it increases your heart rate and burns calories by doing so! Might not seem like much, but household chores can get a sweat going for sure! Yard work, even more so! Sure, it might be too far down in the weeds, but I do a LOT of work around the house other than in the gym that maybe could link to my samsung watch for my pedometer, etc. Timing my walk on the treadmill is easy but it doesn't really capture how much walking I do daily vs my pedometer - and I'd like to keep track of all this in one place such as my PF app instead of 2 or 3 devices - I just end up putting it all in a spreadsheet to get a clear picture, which is time consuming and redundant of course! Lastly, I haven't used any of the real time videos for workouts at home, and may update my review after I have done so. It's too bad I can't access them from a desktop too as an added bonus instead of just on a device... when I'm at work, I don't have that option and would to use part of my lunch hour in my office viewing something I can do when I'm here but don't have my phone or other streaming device other than desktop...",4

4486,com.planetfitness,Works fine. I agree the crowd estimates aren't perfect since it relies on history rather than the people actually checked in. Bug: I have to close out of the app after I check in before it lets me add a workout. May be the phone switching from cell connection at the door to wifi inside the gym?

4582,com.planetfitness,Ok site,4
4583,com.planetfitness,Needs yoga classsed,4
4584,com.planetfitness,"I like the app, but there's always room for improvement. May I suggest you add a special announcements page that can generate notifications to mobile devices. It would be useful to notify users of unexpected closures, specials, new workouts etc.",4
4585,com.planetfitness,"On Android 14, crowd meter is off by hours. Not accurate anymore",4
4586,com.planetfitness,good so far,4
4587,com.planetfitness,"The app is good but is seems a little unfinished, unpolished, and empty.",4
4588,com.planetfitness,I give four stars due to the app I can't rate yet on the gym or to atmosphere yet because I start today. The app just a moment of not working well. The gym itself is very clean at least the one on Georgetown It's huge for me haven't been in a gym for a long time I do everything at home I prefer Just cuz it's convenience but working more and more kind of had to now rely on the gym and the use of it to get ready and then go to work right after. We will see how it will go first day starts today.,4
4589,com.planetfitness,Works well enough but a little slown to open for check in. Biggest issue is with the crowd meter. It's deceiving and inaccurate. I think they do it on purpose.,4
4590,com.planetfitness,The app works pretty great although is does work pretty slow and takes forever to load,4
4591,com.planetfitness,"OVERALL, NOT A BAD APP. I really like the check in barcode, attendance, and the available promos. But, if I may give a suggestion, the workout videos are nice, but is there a way we can get a workout routine in some type of PDF form, something that gives people who have no idea what they are doing, kind of a sense on what they should be working on a day to day basis. Would love to see a full ""set"" list for upper body, lower body, and cardio workout plan.",4
4592,com.planetfitness,"O...kaaaaay,I'm RITENOW JUST TRYIN 2 USE it to find location NEAREST ME...IN TEXAS. AND I Gotta go t hru all this Xtra BEEEE ESSSS, HAHA, to do that. Wudda been faster to enter Pf in googl searchbar.",4
4593,com.planetfitness,"I don't use it much except to scan in. Not sure how often the number counter for people at the gym is refreshing, sometimes it doesn't seem accurate. Sometimes it's slow to load. I wish they could post updates about my location, like when the showers were being rebuilt, it was a surprise to me as I was away on vacation. - that more than the people counter would be a real improvement to me.",4

4596,com.planetfitness,It was good,4
4597,com.planetfitness,Great,4
4598,com.planetfitness,Good place to go i like the unlimited tanning with the black card wish they had a trainer,4
4599,com.planetfitness,Check in feature has stopped working. Originally had the option to have a team member input a club code but that didn't work and the next day that option disappeared entirely.,4
4600,com.planetfitness,"After the revamp and working out some of the bugs, the app has a lot of cool functions that run smoothly. I use the workout and exercise functions, and they leads me through different types of exercises. I was not a user of the old version, and don't use the app to track my exercise. However, for guiding my workouts and signing me up for classes, it works great. Also, customer service was helpful when I initially downloaded the app and it kept crashing. It was fixed.",5
4601,com.planetfitness,"My local club is wonderful. This recent update of the Android version of the app is horrible. It won't allow me past the ""Verifying Membership"" message... Spinning endlessly... I had been able to check in with my phone and check crowds. Come on, PF. Fix this, please. UPDATE - The app was updated, and my previous problems were eliminated. I've changed my rating, and I certainly appreciate the developer's responsiveness.",5
4602,com.planetfitness,"I've used the app for over a year in Florida, and recently relocated to Washington State, and my app was no longer working. I uninstalled and re-installed a few times, restarted my phone, and everything. nothing worked. Error said my email was already in use. but my password was incorrect. I read the reviews here and saw others have had the same issue, so I wanted to share--i emailed the developers about my issue, and they were able to reset my password here and everything works again!",5
4603,com.planetfitness,Previous member that just rejoined. This app has completely changed my experience. Being able to see how busy the gym is as well as not having to have that annoying Keychain card with me all the time is amazing. There are several other features in the app I haven't used yet. But you really don't need anything else to have a better experience than PF members had years ago.,5
4604,com.planetfitness,"Everything I can hope for from PF App is available. Asking for anything more would be expecting too much considering the value that PF offers. If there were an option to pay an additional fee for apparatus connectivity and automated workout tracking, etc...I would strongly consider paying for it. Overall, I'm extremely happy with the whole PF experience.",5
4605,com.planetfitness,Very user friendly but sometimes it's a gamble on weather the picture will 'snap a workout' and upload the excersise. When it fails to upload they give you a few options to correct like blurry picture or glare but it's a general statement. It would help me if I got the picture back with the specific reason it was rejected. This way I can learn from MY mistake and improve the odds of my next workout being uploaded. This is a great app with many features I havnt even tapped into yet.,5
4606,com.planetfitness,"I love my gym, and the simplicity of the app and its many beneficial applications. And, the Planet Fitness staff are always professional, knowledgeable, friendly, and very customer service oriented. During this Covid 19 pandemic, I do not worry about participating at the gym because the staff, and patrons are very conscious about a clean and safe environment. The app also provides for home workouts streamed to your device.",5
4607,com.planetfitness,"I love using this Planet Fitness app, it also help explain their workout machines if you are unsure how to use them properly. Overall it makes the planet fitness workout experience great tracking you check-ins and also makes it super easy to add guest for black card users and members. It also has perks which I don't use but non the less they are there. Not really sure what improvements it needs as it serves me for my purposes very well. I'm sure if you have a great suggestion they'll take it.",5
4608,com.planetfitness,Haven't I had a single issue with the app whatsoever since I've installed it so it works well. I like that I can keep track of activities and time and calories burned while there and be able to reference it later if I want to see any progress I've made. Takes a little bit to get used to how it flows but once you figure that out very simple to use the app and features on i t,5
4609,com.planetfitness,"The app more than serves its purpose however I like to check the PF gyms in the area to find the lowest attendence. Using the app to do so requires clicking on each club to get the info and this get monotonous. A home screen widget would be better that showed the gyms I add in, the attendence meter for each off to the right and a check in button. A smart phone screen coukd display many gyms at once.",5
4610,com.planetfitness,"I love it! Use it all the time now for the crowd meter. I also CAST the workouts from the app to do at home. I've also double checked how to use various machines by using the code on the machine, then watching the instructions. When I first started with PF 2 years ago, I used it to learn the different ways to use the 30 minute workout room. It helped me go from simple steps to more complicated moves.",5
4611,com.planetfitness,I just recently joined. the app is pretty simple to figure out. I like that it displays the crowd meter. clean facility and really nice people work at the front desk. the one girl Shawna helped me set up my app because Im not good with techy stuff at all but I'm learning!!,5
4612,com.planetfitness,it's a lot faster to get in the gym than just waiting for like 20 minutes to get all the things ready to go workout it's just a lot easier and very helpful for new people to workout except you can't workout until you're 14 that doesn't make sense but it's whatever pretty cool app great people,5
4613,com.planetfitness,The app is easy to navigate and has plenty of workouts for your needs. The crowd meter is probably the best part about the app. It helps to get an idea of how crowded it is. I myself prefer fewer people! *laughs*,5
4614,com.planetfitness,"I love exercising along with the videos. It's like my own private class. The instructors are excellent, encouraging, and always show options for each exercise to accommodate varying fitness levels.",5
4615,com.planetfitness,"App works just fine. crowd meter is an essential feature. idk abt all the perks offered and have not redeemed any, but mostly, the app works like it's supposed to for me and makes check in easy.",5
4616,com.planetfitness,The app is nice to see the crowd meter. I just really don't like waiting on machines and free weights. I wished PF had a larger free weight area and less of the elliptical & bikes that I rarely see anyone on these machines.I highly recommend using the app.,5
4617,com.planetfitness,"Honestly, I only use this app just so I have a quick way to check in at my gym. I use my fitness watch to track my workouts, but this app is also capable of doing the same if you don't have one of those. The app hasn't given me any trouble so far and doesn't crash my phone like some other faulty apps do. So far so good, no complaints üëç",5
4618,com.planetfitness,"I love that I can check in using the app and get to my work out faster. I also am a beginner, I use the workouts in the app and they help me work out like a total pro! Easy to use and very helpful.",5

4620,com.planetfitness,"I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE my Planet Fitness in Marinette, WI.!!! I usually go with my daughter (almost every day) we start off with warm upps then head over to the treadmills for 20 mins.-1 hour, then we pamper ourselves with the tanning session and end our visit with the hydro beds! I either go after work or on my days off it depends. I've never had a bad experience and everyone there is so friendly and never judges. It always makes me feel better and completes my day :)",5
4621,com.planetfitness,I really like the crowd meter so it gives you an idea whether there's a lot of people there and I like the exercises in the app and the workouts to do on the app with the black card. Nobody judges there and so love that too.,5

4623,com.planetfitness,The app is fine. All PFs need more than one machine of a type. One assisted chin up is a burn. Almost can never use it. Either someone standing there on their phone or every time you check. Someone is using it. Get more than one machine of each type.,5
4624,com.planetfitness,It truly is judgment free! I go there 2-3 times a week and don't even use any of the equipment! I'm only there to use the massage beds/chairs and tan. The staff is polite and kind and anticipate my needs! My husband and I have been members for a few months and today we signed up our two older kids!

4800,women.workout.female.fitness,"It's just ads on tops of more ads. I can't even open the app or touch a single thing without having to watch several full length ads and be pressured into buying premium. Added to that, it straight up won't let me even access content at all (or continuing one I've already started) without paying for it. I get the need for ads to stay free, but this is way too much. Uninstalled.",1
4801,women.workout.female.fitness,"Don't bother downloading this. I did and I paid to get the ad free version. Half of the workout challenges won't let you do them or continue your progress without upgrading to premium. It is hard enough to find motivation and time to work out, that dirty cashgrab tactic just ruins the experience and steals all motivation. Honestly I wish I could get my money back thats how angry I am. Edit. Thanks for the canned useless response Developer. The whole bit about upgrade to premium was helpful.",1
4802,women.workout.female.fitness,"Extremely disappointed! I really like the Arm Workout app by the same company, and when my coach suggested I try HIIT I tried this app first. This app assumes you know exactly what you're doing and you know the exercises. No 'ramp up' in difficulty for beginners, just thrown straight in and try to keep up. No options for ""apartment friendly"" workouts (I'm on the second floor, I DON'T want to stomp my neighbors awake).",1
4803,women.workout.female.fitness,I'm not asking to transfer subscriptions. I'm saying the accounts are not the same and I have the same log in info. I can't see any workouts that were done. I already paid for a premium on my new device. And was charged on my old device. How can I get a refund for the apple phone I no longer use. Is this the only way communication happens? I have the premium but don't have access to meals. And I'm not understanding how my progress isn't showing on my new device.,1
4804,women.workout.female.fitness,"I'm not sure what's happened, but suddenly I'm not able to access any of the workouts without paying. I've been using this app for years with success.",1
4805,women.workout.female.fitness,This app deceives and the bad part is you have to load the exercises you want to do ...... And the ads are too long....... This exercise didn't get me to my achieved goal and even decreased me from where I was to something lower do not recommend this app to anyone ........It needs a better update....,1
4806,women.workout.female.fitness,Right after doing 3 to 4 days of workout it suddenly says to go premium. If we need to have premium for this course then should have told at the start. Now that I'm half way through you people suddenly change the setting . This is really a bad system,1
4807,women.workout.female.fitness,"It's not free! They don't tell u that part until u finish taking bout 50 questions! An then they ask me again, so u spend a lot of time an effort answering Q's, ALL for nothing Waste my damn time that was a big disappointment because some people really need help and don't have money to pay for it like myself thank you very much but no thank you I no pay! It's not evn guaranteed!! Screw Liers!",1
4808,women.workout.female.fitness,Only for once it was free to watch and the next day it ask for subscription üòµ,1
4809,women.workout.female.fitness,I'm unhappy with this application because after one day of workout it's forcing me to buy the plan without ads otherwise is not gonna let me to do the exercise...,1
4810,women.workout.female.fitness,"This app was good at first but for certain workouts it expects you to watch ads witch i didn't mind at first but eventually when i tried to do the workouts with the ads, when i clicked on the ad button it kept taking me back to the homepage and I had to click the ad button several times before it would work and it just got frustrating and annoying. It might just be a mull function on my side but if it's not I'm just warning you",1
4811,women.workout.female.fitness,"I have used the app for a month and subscribed to it. Once I uninstalled it, I still got charged in my bank account for the the monthly subscription fee. There is no clear and easy way to unsubscribe. I have contacted the creator's via email without any response. Very disappointed.",1
4812,women.workout.female.fitness,"Installed this hoping that the 'for women' part of it had to do with the different muscle structures, and it misses entire groups of muscles, and feels very sexist. I can work out my thighs and booty, but not my calves which i need for my job. Downloaded the men's version and theres the calf workout. Im sure these are fine apps, but ill be avoiding the entire lot of them in favor of apps that focus on muscle groups rather than excluding workouts for women.",1
4813,women.workout.female.fitness,"Not impressed and upset with this app, you are forced to watch a video before you can get on with your workout and the video that you are forced to watch takes ages to finally load and play by the time it's done loading you're over the mood of wanting to workout I am not happy and I am deleting this app I need an app that will allow me to workout in peace I do not mind adverts on an app but if it takes forever to load thats where it becomes a problem.",1
4814,women.workout.female.fitness,I've been using this app for more than 2 weeks and made it a routine to do it in the morning and suddey today the app itself isnt opening bcz of the ad which is loading from the beginning. I waited for about 10 mins and its still loading! As im very packed in the morning with a schedule this has really wasted alot of my time!!,1
4815,women.workout.female.fitness,I still see the ads and the option to make purchase and remove ads even after purchasing the subscription. This is so frustrating!!! Have always loved this app for how it really helped me with a consistent schedule and transforming my fitness,1
4816,women.workout.female.fitness,Was enjoying the app. This week they put in some techno pop in the background. It restarts many times during your workout and is super annoying. As far as I can tell there is no option to disable it.,1
4817,women.workout.female.fitness,"**update** 1 star, you can review your workout, add weight to an exercise, increase reps overall not a good app. It records workouts ok. The short video and quick explanation make sure you do the move correctly. The downside, you can't add in weight or resistant used, no spot to add notes. If when doing the exercise you push yourself their is no way to notate the additional rep in for that set. Limited number of exercise for body parts. This needs some updates to make 5 stars.",1
4818,women.workout.female.fitness,"This app keeps showing popup push ads when not in use and when I fully close it. Their ads would show up while I'm using other apps, texting, GPS or when I just turn on my phone. There's no feature to turn it off.",1
4819,women.workout.female.fitness,"horrible, beyond horrible. I downloaded the app and wasnt even using it but suddenly I was getting texts and I was being charged!! what the hell!! despicable and I wiuldnt recommend to anyone at all!! just search exercise ideas on pinterest (there are plenty) and use you phone timer instead. Simple and doesnt freaking charge you money!!!",1
4820,women.workout.female.fitness,"Hai, i've purchased to remove the ads coz its so annoying. It was successfully deducted to my account but the app doest implement it. There are still ads popping everywhere. Hope ye could help me with this. Might change my rating once its resolved. Thanks.",1
4821,women.workout.female.fitness,I'm disappointed because this App says free options but when we want to try its irritating because we cannot openthe app asking money for remove the ads. After pressing so many times no options still cannot do the workouts,1
4822,women.workout.female.fitness,"I enjoyed this app for a few days, however, it is NOT worth the massive amounts of push ads it forces on your screen. I can't even begin to tell how many times I was interrupted typing emails/texts/just simply scrolling by a pop up ad.",1
4823,women.workout.female.fitness,"I would rates as 5 star because I like this App and I don't mind about Ads, but please could you move Ads for few second later after exercise is finished? Ads don't let the program to finish the word ""Congra...."". This is annoying. I will change my rates after you will change it.",1
4824,women.workout.female.fitness,"I used this a few weeks back before Christmas paid the price not to get ads, then stopped using it but still had it installed, gone back to using it and now the ads are back, and I see no extra plans or anything. Kinda annoyed in all honesty",1
4825,women.workout.female.fitness,"helped me in getting toned stomach in a month ( along with proper diet, no junk) amazing app, gives reminders for exercising, can track weight loss, just needs new workouts to be added! ***** edited: still no new workouts added its been 3 months the app lacks workouts for many things, new exercises could be added to already existing workouts.. it hasnt updated even once. *****",1
4826,women.workout.female.fitness,"You can't even run the app without clicking an add. I understand that free version will have less capabilities but at least I'm expecting to be able to run it. But no, all I get is an add screen.",1
4827,women.workout.female.fitness,It would be good if I could do ANYTHING for more than 15 secs without an ad popping up. Even when the app is closed ads are still popping up on my phone. Unacceptable. Please fix.,1
4828,women.workout.female.fitness,"Was great at first but now to do the exercises I have to watch an ad, which normally I am ok with, but the ads will never load up and then get sent back to where I started. I am 3 days into my routine and can't even finish. Uninstalled and got a new workout app.",1
4829,women.workout.female.fitness,"Used this app the first time and thought ""great"" The very next day I tried to use it again but couldn't get into the workouts unless I upgraded to premium. Only advertised as having ""in-app purchases"" not that you have to upgrade before you can use it again. Uninstalled",1
4830,women.workout.female.fitness,"It was working just fine but while I was doing the full body workout, it suddenly stopped and went back to the homepage repeatedly. i uninstalled and reinstalled it but the problem persists.",1
4831,women.workout.female.fitness,I have not tried this as yet because the ad ran over an hour and l could not get rid of it. I understand the need for ads but that's ridiculous. I am now out of time to exercise. If I have the same problem tomorrow l will uninstall.,1
4832,women.workout.female.fitness,"Apparently women dont have shoulders, backs, or chests (body parts not listed and no exercises available). This app has the quality of content you'd expect from a Cosmopolitan article. Please don't take it seriously and expect results.",1
4833,women.workout.female.fitness,Could you please fix the calories burnt count. It is highly inaccurate and gives false hope to us when we are actually trying to progress. The excersises are fairly easy to do and to follow. I only have an issue with the calories burnt measure,1
4834,women.workout.female.fitness,"The app is misleading, it says it's free, but it won't allow you after first day and compell you to go premium üëé Replying to developer: it would be nice if you calrify these separately to help users identify those free contents within the app, before users unknowingly proceed to accept those premium contents. Thanks üëç",1
4835,women.workout.female.fitness,"This app is a good one, I'm enjoying every bit of it just that the developers need to work on the excessive ads that keeps popping on and on. Aside that it has got what I am looking for.",1
4836,women.workout.female.fitness,Downloaded to try. Need to subscribe to do so. No thanks. What makes you think most of us can afford it. It took me to the Internet for details amd email. So no app was used. Went on the 4-5* reviews to download a good app. Clearly something went wrong. Not happy with it,1
4837,women.workout.female.fitness,This app is the worst I downloaded it for my sister and it didn't ask for her fitness leave(how many pushups you can do) like the other app for guys and didn't even had a post workout difficulty level adjustment (was it easy or hard) so she was only suggested the most difficult exercises that no beginner can do,1
4838,women.workout.female.fitness,3rd request for info or don't you care? Why can't you add exercises? Body part exercises state there are a number of workouts but it only repeats 1 combination. Why? What's the point of no variation in exercises? Can you be bothered answering this time?,1
4839,women.workout.female.fitness,App has great exercises but pathetic management. The ads timer gets struck everytime. Watched ad 8 times still couldn't download the required set of exercise. Extremely disappointed.,1
4840,women.workout.female.fitness,I like this app. But the calories burned for each routine were horribly inaccurate. Like 3x as much as you would actually burn. Very disappointed when I realised truly how off it was,1
4841,women.workout.female.fitness,It was cool but a little annoying with constant reminders while I'm in class at school. And too many ads and overall skipping and a black screen,1
4842,women.workout.female.fitness,"Confusing, the sound pops up even if it's disabled, I cannot make my own workout routine or select exercises I cannot do (I'm injured and cannot move certain muscles). And I hate that slim happy woman on the opening splash page.",1
4843,women.workout.female.fitness,"By using this app guidelines for workout my lower back is facing extreme pain right now, as the work outs gave excess pressure on the lower spine. I'll recommend to workout with proper guidance and not to use app guidance.",1
4844,women.workout.female.fitness,"Disapointed, because the app was Iisted under ""free"" exersize apps, and even several reviews stated it was free to use, but after all the set up questions, the app immediately made purchase conditional for use. It was only free to answer a bunch of questions and get dooped!",1
4845,women.workout.female.fitness,It only gives you 1 day of challenges then you have to buy premium. Such a disappointment.,1
4846,women.workout.female.fitness,"Did not even have this app for a day and I was getting ads when I answered a phone call. I don't mind in app ads, but when I'm getting them outside the app it's a no go for me. It's really disappointed because I was really looking forward to this app.",1
4847,women.workout.female.fitness,"The calorie-count is extremely inaccurate, please fix it!! Otherwise I like the exercises and would give you a 5 star if it got fixed.",1
4848,women.workout.female.fitness,"App doesn't open. it looks like it's going to open and then closes after a few seconds. I can't even see the main screen, it closes before Please fix that :(",1
4849,women.workout.female.fitness,"I gave one star simply to write a review, otherwise I would've given none. This app does not work do not waste your time. I used it almost full term and have seen no results. I then started working out with Mandy Ingber and have been doing so for the past 4 days and already seen results",1
4850,women.workout.female.fitness,"Absolutely worthless app. Been working out on intermediate level for 3 months. Cut carbs and calories, complete change in diet. Still weigh 196 lbs 3 months later. Get a real workout app that will give you exercises that repeat reps to get a real workout with results.",1
4851,women.workout.female.fitness,"Exercises are the same as those on other, less confusing apps. Plus, if you live in an apartment building this app is definitely not for you. Some exercises involve jumping and skipping which you can't do, unless you want to upset your neighbors üôÑ",1
4852,women.workout.female.fitness,"Your exercices "" leg raise and flutter ckicks"" are wrong . My vertebrae were damaged after do they. My doctor said: for bigginers you should put your elbow on the ground and stand your upper body up . I was in a lot of pain because of this mistake of yours and I couldn't walk for a long time. üòìüò≠üò¢",1
4853,women.workout.female.fitness,After loving it now its annoying. Uninstalled ..its annoying to have to watch an ad before the workout and half the time the ad freezes start video all over..forget it,1
4854,women.workout.female.fitness,It's good app for home workout. I have been doing this for 28 days. No change in my body is seen and also I have changed my diet completely. Really not satisfiedüòî,1
4855,women.workout.female.fitness,Can't get into the app. It opens to an ad with no way to close it. Every single time. And I've tried everything to close it and it won't. So I can't use the app because of the ad glitch.,1
4856,women.workout.female.fitness,"I can't rate this because afer installing it couldn't start up on my phone, the one star rating its just for posting, i have uninstalled and installed again but still didn't work on my phone. And am asking is it for all android phone type?",1
4857,women.workout.female.fitness,This application is just showing which exercise to do along with the timmer but it is not guiding at all how to do it and it's steps. You need to fix it in order to make this application worthy.,1
4858,women.workout.female.fitness,would be an amazing app if you could actually edit the plan. everytime i would scroll it would freak out. everytime id replace a workout theyd add it again.,1
4859,women.workout.female.fitness,Workouts are fine but it's messed up that it requires you to calculate your BMI and shows it to you at the end of every workout even tho we know that's an outdated and problematic measurement that doesn't correlate to health at all.,1
4860,women.workout.female.fitness,"I can't really rate this app since I haven't had the chance to use it yet. I set up my daily reminder, but the app has yet to remind me of any workouts.",1
4861,women.workout.female.fitness,I could only do day one of a 4 week challenge before being asked to pay for premium. No option to watch a advert to do day 2. Very disappointed as I really enjoyed day 2,1
4862,women.workout.female.fitness,When the app updated the now want you to pay monthly to try other workouts! I mean it's just an app so uninstalled it after I couldn't do any other workout.,1
4863,women.workout.female.fitness,Default TTS is Chinese and the app crashes when Device TTS Setting is tried to be changed. Uninstalling. Thanks.,1
4864,women.workout.female.fitness,worst app they taught exercise for those who are already doing not for beginners just 15 mins of exercise game me 4 days of leg pain they are not teaching warm ups or nothing they should have improved by giving diet chart proper starting. they ve given just some excercise not good very bad sorry for bad review should improve,1
4865,women.workout.female.fitness,"This is for all my Christians out there: don't get this app! It promotes yoga in such a subtle way and I didn't even realize it, the ads are about plastic surgeons. I know some Christians think that yoga's okay, but the goal of it is to empty your mind and this leaves room for the devil and the poses are of different Hindu gods. Some people put Christian in front of yoga to make it better, but adding Christian to anything immoral doesn't make it better.",1
4866,women.workout.female.fitness,"Will not let me into a routine, the app keeps closing. When I try to watch a video it closes as well. Very sad!!! :(",1
4867,women.workout.female.fitness,Seriously i have been working out from a one nd half month . I did the intermediate exercises still it's no use...i see that my body hasn't even reduced an inch! Terrible!,1
4868,women.workout.female.fitness,Didn't pay for the premium but tried some of the things that they have for free without any of the results but they do have a disclaimer letting you know that most results do not pertain to every client.,1
4869,women.workout.female.fitness,"First question is a fail. Right out of the gate it's asking me to pick my ""trouble zone"". I don't have one, I just want to be stronger. Don't need to encourage ppl to hate their bodies at the very moment they're taking initiative to improve their health. üëéüëéüëé",1
4870,women.workout.female.fitness,Open any workout to unlock any exercise you have to watch video nd once you unlock it then all exercise will again lock nd if you want to see exercise again then you have to unlock it by watching video again... There's no health tips also.....,1
4871,women.workout.female.fitness,Don't waste your time on these workouts they are not hard the advanced are not advanced I recommend going on YouTube and find some real workouts but if you need to lose weight then you should get it in but if you already work out and are fit then don't waste your time,1
4872,women.workout.female.fitness,I like the app but my friend has the exact same app version as me and they have the recipe section while I do not. I'll give 5 star when I have recipes. Thanks,1
4873,women.workout.female.fitness,"Hi some of parts in routine that are about face fitness couldn't open them and just tells for unlock it watch video but no video doesn't come after that I click on that,please help",1
4874,women.workout.female.fitness,"So, i can never workout if i don't have internet access? The app kept asking me to watch ads for every single workout eventhough i don't have internet.",1

4883,women.workout.female.fitness,I do NOT like it. it does not help you it's hard and the update SUCKSSS. plz don't download it it will only hurt you. it does help you lose belly fat but breaks you back and time. always rember time is a gift don't wast it.I HATE IT,1
4884,women.workout.female.fitness,Its good but i complete the whole month workouts but it shows day 28 on full body workout . I cannot understand what it is.... Plzzzzzzzz solve my problem i am missing my workouts plzzzz,1
4885,women.workout.female.fitness,"Why are they asking for premium instead of showing ads and doing exercise, pls remove this premium I'm not able to workout.",1
4886,women.workout.female.fitness,So many ads,1
4887,women.workout.female.fitness,"I was interested, completely put off by the adds during set up",1
4888,women.workout.female.fitness,In my honest opinion wasn't the right app for me when I was doing the workouts for me it said I was on a diet and everything but instead of loosing weight I gained weight and not in muscle just in body fat,1
4889,women.workout.female.fitness,Lot of Ads. Ads to unlock exercises. Hassle.,1
4890,women.workout.female.fitness,I've been trying to cancel my subscription for weeks now and no luck. I'll have contest my card payments,1
4891,women.workout.female.fitness,This app is asome It help me to stay fit and healthy,1
4892,women.workout.female.fitness,This has to be one of the worst apps I have ever downloaded Requires data to load exercises and still has a lot of bugs,1

4923,women.workout.female.fitness,I'm not asking to transfer subscriptions. I'm saying the accounts are not the same and I have the same log in info. I can't see any workouts that were done. I already paid for a premium on my new device. And was charged on my old device. How can I get a refund for the apple phone I no longer use. Is this the only way communication happens? I have the premium but don't have access to meals. And I'm not understanding how my progress isn't showing on my new device.,1

4930,women.workout.female.fitness,"It's just ads on tops of more ads. I can't even open the app or touch a single thing without having to watch several full length ads and be pressured into buying premium. Added to that, it straight up won't let me even access content at all (or continuing one I've already started) without paying for it. I get the need for ads to stay free, but this is way too much. Uninstalled.",1
4931,women.workout.female.fitness,This app deceives and the bad part is you have to load the exercises you want to do ...... And the ads are too long.......

4947,women.workout.female.fitness,Right after doing 3 to 4 days of workout it suddenly says to go premium. If we need to have premium for this course then should have told at the start. Now that I'm half way through you people suddenly change the setting . This is really a bad system,1

4955,women.workout.female.fitness,"Extremely disappointed! I really like the Arm Workout app by the same company, and when my coach suggested I try HIIT I tried this app first. This app assumes you know exactly what you're doing and you know the exercises. No 'ramp up' in difficulty for beginners, just thrown straight in and try to keep up. No options for ""apartment friendly"" workouts (I'm on the second floor, I DON'T want to stomp my neighbors awake).",1
4956,women.workout.female.fitness,"Used this app the first time and thought ""great"" The very next day I tried to use it again but couldn't get into the workouts unless I upgraded to premium.

4967,women.workout.female.fitness,"Disapointed, because the app was Iisted under ""free"" exersize apps, and even several reviews stated it was free to use, but after all the set up questions, the app immediately made purchase conditional for use. It was only free to answer a bunch of questions and get dooped!",1
4968,women.workout.female.fitness,Very good üòå,1
4969,women.workout.female.fitness,I could only do day one of a 4 week challenge before being asked to pay for premium. No option to watch a advert to do day 2. Very disappointed as I really enjoyed day 2,1
4970,women.workout.female.fitness,"I have used the app for a month and subscribed to it. Once I uninstalled it, I still got charged in my bank account for the the monthly subscription fee.

4990,women.workout.female.fitness,When the app updated the now want you to pay monthly to try other workouts! I mean it's just an app so uninstalled it after I couldn't do any other workout.,1
4991,women.workout.female.fitness,This app not riships video,1
4992,women.workout.female.fitness,"This app is a good one, I'm enjoying every bit of it just that the developers need to work on the excessive ads that keeps popping on and on. Aside that it has got what I am looking for.",1
4993,women.workout.female.fitness,Good üëç if you keep at it!,1
4994,women.workout.female.fitness,This is really amazing app for all those women. Who have not time to take care.,1

4998,women.workout.female.fitness,You have to pay to do it it's so dumb,1
4999,women.workout.female.fitness,did not work and i been doing the work out for 1 to 2 years,1
5000,women.workout.female.fitness,"Won't let you continue certain workouts unless you ""go premium"" and pay... because being forced to watch an entire commercial wasn't paying enough. So... I uninstalled and downloaded a different app - so far so good. Update/Response: Thank you for your response. I completely understand the need to advertise to keep the app free. I will watch the advertisements. My issue with the app is the forced ""go premium"" for certain workouts. Thanks for listening.",2
5001,women.workout.female.fitness,"This is not an app, it's a basic quiz followed by an extremely long video selling an exercise program. It sounds like you have great knowledge and a great story, but I had to walk away to deal with my dog over 20 mins in, and when I came back, the video had stopped and I had to start the quiz over, which I did, thinking maybe I'd get to the app finally, but no, it just brought me back to the begining of the video. I would have paid for add free, maybe even the program, but I feel mislead.",2
5002,women.workout.female.fitness,"Used to love this app. Now there's an ad everytime I open it and it's annoying. This morning it showed a video game with a dead elephant. I'm vegan. I had to wait 5 seconds before skipping. I'm looking for a new app. Edit: I get advertising, but it never used to have an ad while opening the app. That's just too much. And there are constant ads running in the background.",2
5003,women.workout.female.fitness,It is a good workout but the exercises is extremely hard and not for beginners. The amount of time they kept for exercises is horrible,2
5004,women.workout.female.fitness,"This app was my go-to workout application. But I don't know why, but the update is that in the end of the exercise, it does not let me give feedback on how hard/easy the exercise was, in order to modify the exercises for the next workout session.",2
5005,women.workout.female.fitness,"The app is pretty good. I love how balanced every workout routine is in terms of ease and flexibility. The only thing I would request the developer to do is correct the amount of calories shown at the end of every workout. From what I have noticed, the calories are shown on the basis of time spent rather than the no. of reps of each exercise which is really misleading. I'm giving two stars only because of this issue. Please correct it asap.",2
5006,women.workout.female.fitness,You need to watch ads as from day 2 to be able to workout and some workout exxercises need you to go PREMIUM. But the exercises are easy to do,2
5007,women.workout.female.fitness,"I really love this developers other 30 Day apps, especially cos I can listen to my podcast app while doing the workouts. But this one forces me to listen to it's own soundtrack, and if there is a feature to disable this it's impossible to find (tried changing the sound settings but nothing worked..)",2
5008,women.workout.female.fitness,"Overall it's good and was satisfied with the workout plans but for the past 1 month I'm unable to open the exercises that need to be unlocked. Tried many times on several days but still unable to unlock the exercises. It keep showing ""Unable to unlock, try again later"". I have emailed you almost a week ago but still no reply till now.",2
5009,women.workout.female.fitness,It seems too easy and I don't even consider myself to be in the advance stage of being fit. I found myself doing extra exercises after the challenges were over. I also agree with the other person's comment about it being annoying and confusing to have the extra 3 seconds after 30 - there's more than plenty of time to get ready for the next exercise in that time. Or at least remove the countdown to the 30 seconds. The variety of the exercises is good though.,2
5010,women.workout.female.fitness,The workouts are well done and a good way to get into the habit or exercising. I can only give a 2 star rating because the calories are way off. Fix this and y they can get a 3-3.5. DON'T BELIEVE THE CALORIE BURNT NUMBERS. The are 4x greater than what you actually burn. Checked it against my fitbit. It would be greatbif tge updated these.,2
5011,women.workout.female.fitness,"Does send data to Google Fit, but doesn't get weight from Google Fit. I would like to sync my weight across the different apps I use via Google fit, but this app keeps messing with my data. I would also like to be able to set that it can only receive my weight from Google Fit but not send it, as I don't want to set my weight every time I work out. But it would already be an improvement if the app started getting the weight from Google Fit.",2
5012,women.workout.female.fitness,"I have this on my phone for mobility, but wanted in on my tablet as well so its easier to see and hear at home. But since it doesnt sync up i struggle to figure when i did what exercise without having both in front of me and checking back and forth.",2
5013,women.workout.female.fitness,"Unstructured and too short time per exercise. You need to switch from a standing position to a ground position and back again. In too little time. The user can change that order, but I want a ready workout from the shelf. The time per exercise is quite short also. I cannot recommend this app.",2
5014,women.workout.female.fitness,"I just started being encouraged about my ability to do this and get into the habit of working out. Going further requires me to pay. Yet the app won't take my payment, claiming that it can't and that maybe Google Play is out of date. Everything I have is up to date and I still can't pay to remove adds or go premium.",2
5015,women.workout.female.fitness,"Its got good workout but calorie count is soooo wrong. Originally rated 1 star but i have noticed muscle strength so up to 2 stars. Will give more if the calorie count is accurate, Telling people they have burnt 200+ calories in a 8 min low impact workout. It takes a good 45 minute workout at high intensity to burn around 400 cals. Leading people to possibly eat more as they think they have burnt more. Misleading information for novice users.",2
5016,women.workout.female.fitness,"Liking the app and the exercises, but one essential problem is that if I shortly leave the app to change music or something else, I loose the program and have to start over. Extremely annoying.",2
5017,women.workout.female.fitness,"I like the exercises, but it's not user friendly and I'm struggling to access meal ideas that the advertising shows for this app. Very limited compared to the exercises they show as well.",2
5018,women.workout.female.fitness,Actually good really bored of this app. Downloaded it as a beginner and found trying to find exercises for beginners really hard to find. I lacked motivation after changing some of the exercises in the fitness routines. Not for me.....the search continues,2
5019,women.workout.female.fitness,"Very disappointed it only counts half of the time I actually work out. My sister & I both download this app, me on android her on Apple; hers doesn't do this. I emailed for assistance, it's been 2 weeks without a reply so I'm leaving my rating. With Samsung you can watch ads to unlock extra workouts but Apple does not give you that option you have to purchase it, so then we're sharing my phone. Neither of us are really feeling any burn where we should with these exercises. Overall unsatisfied.",2
5020,women.workout.female.fitness,"i was looking for an app to inspire me with different exercise combinations. Nice range of exercises but i disliked the focus on measuring tapes and unattainable muscle photos. Doing ""abs beginner"" doesn't mean having a flat stomach with no definition nor does doing ""abs advanced"" mean you'll have the kind of 6 pack you can only get through good lighting, exceptional genes and dehydrating yourself. I work out because I love my body and I'm not looking to start exercising to punish myself",2
5021,women.workout.female.fitness,"Very happy to have found this App. It's been 4 days and I just love it. It's very motivating and never gets boring because there are so many different workouts and most of them are free HOWEVER Every single image of a woman in this app is of a WHITE WOMAN. Every, single image, not one Asian woman, not one South Asian woman and definitely no images of Black women. I sent an email advising of my concerns and the response I got was that they would seriously consider it. No changes made yet...",2
5022,women.workout.female.fitness,It's a very good app but I can't process with day 2...I'm still stuck at dae one,2
5023,women.workout.female.fitness,"I found 3 issues with the app. Stretches, engagment, and content. Stretches- there arent enough to help with all the tendons engaged. Engagment- there is an inbalance of which muscles are being used in which routinues. Content- if this app is meant for beginners, then there isnt enough instruction on how to do each exercise, leaving no results or the idividual using muscles they shouldnt. Combine that with not enough stretching or over using certain areas and you get pain and poor satisfation",2
5024,women.workout.female.fitness,"While the workouts and programs are great, the adds are so annoying. I hate having to watch an add just to do the next workout. I'm also not paying $5 just to remove adds.",2
5025,women.workout.female.fitness,"I dont like that it assumes youre on this to loose weight. The weight graph on the progress tracker screen leaves room below current weight, waiting for you to loose weight. Im in the healthy bmi, im a good weigh, im on here to gain muscle. If i was to get as low as is on the screen id be underweight. To anyone who suffers from any mental illness towards their weight this could quite easily imply to them that they need to reach the weight at the bottom. Could change so weight is in the middle",2
5026,women.workout.female.fitness,"I was very disappointed by how focused on weight loss and beauty this app is. It presumes you are trying to lose weight and asks about current and goal weight. Even if you skip this step it doesn't remove the weight loss goal. Not all women spend their time obsessing about their weight and wrinkles. It's 2023! If it's a weight loss and beauty app, call it a weight loss and beauty app. If it's for women add features that help you aligning your work outs with you hormonal rhythm or something.",2
5027,women.workout.female.fitness,"The amount of calories burnt is unrealistically high. The exercises are good, but you just can't use this app properly if you are counting calories and trying to loose weight.",2
5028,women.workout.female.fitness,"Never buy this app, nothing helps. I used 16 days arm toned and zero result üò°,every day the same exercise and so many advertisment around 2 minutes long, only advertisements,I am happy that I havent paid,now I have found normal app where challenge with different exercise for 3 month.",2
5029,women.workout.female.fitness,Although I appreciate that the app offers focus points that women may want to tone. It does not really offer a vqrietybof work out for full body toning or even weight loss.,2
5030,women.workout.female.fitness,Good app with lots of variety even for the free version. Downside is the ads.,2
5031,women.workout.female.fitness,"Nope. If I wanted to pay for fitness I'd go to a gym, get my money worth. The point of doing this via and app is so i don't have to pay...I didn't see anything that said I'd have to pay, until after I had put in all my information. Guess I'll just stick to YouTube videos, which are free. Thanks for nothing.",2
5032,women.workout.female.fitness,"NOT FOR BEGINNERS. After just two of their beginner exercises, I can hardly breathe or stop coughing. The rests need to be longer and it needs to start out slower!",2
5033,women.workout.female.fitness,I love ‚ù§Ô∏è workouts on here and challenges on here. But for the beast lifting challenge why do we do.have to.pay the rest of it. That is totally unfair.üò† before it was when got to watch add now you have to continue the challenge I not impressed üòë. I hope you fix so.where we don't have to pay üòûüëé,2
5034,women.workout.female.fitness,It can help in day ONE but in day 2 you need to pay! Inappropriate! Why? Because you already building up your exercise and now it's ruined because you can't continue the plan! How not helpful is this app!,2
5035,women.workout.female.fitness,"Has good workouts, however when I watch an ad it doesnt unlock the workout. You have many complaints about this issue and really need to fix it.",2
5036,women.workout.female.fitness,"It was working just fine until it randomly started crashing. Now every time I try to open the app, the screen goes blank and I'm sent back to my phone's homepage.",2
5037,women.workout.female.fitness,There's something sketchy about this app. They calculated my BMI to be far higher than it is. Even changing the weight doesn't change the BMI number. That ain't right.,2
5038,women.workout.female.fitness,"it is very good app benificial to people doing exercises at home. execept its crashing and I did day 3 of week 2 n now it shows 82.1 minutes, 210 exercise and 1943 cal burned. while I did 20 exercises today. I don't know what to expect.",2
5039,women.workout.female.fitness,It's a good app but right now I cant walk I've ripped the muscle in my upper thigh and hurts so badly and I did the beginners thigh training one there not enough stretching afterwards to help you with the muscles . PLEASE I WARN YOU BE CAREFUL DONT OVER DO IT PLACES YOURSELF. But by military ways this is how you build it you ripped it to peace and built it back up threw extream training,2
5040,women.workout.female.fitness,It's an alright app but the calories burnt shown are excessive and deceptive and certainly false. I would suggest making that segment realistic.,2
5041,women.workout.female.fitness,"Screen shots and in the app are different. Misleading, but overall its a good app work workout routine. No diet plan",2
5042,women.workout.female.fitness,"is the calories counter accurate? because i don't feel it is. i have to jump rope about 25min to burn 250 calories, but according to app i lost 243 calories in just 20min by doing some stretch , squats, side hops.",2
5043,women.workout.female.fitness,Face workout seems so random and repetitive. I wish there was more content for a full face workout.,2
5044,women.workout.female.fitness,I'm my height is 5 foot three inches but for some reason these app thinks it's not a real height üôÑ there people that short and lot other ADULTS even shorter üò°don't expect me to give you a 5 stars unless you fix your these.

5045,women.workout.female.fitness,Since today morning there is one clovia ad that keeps playing. Even when the close button is enabled it doesn't work.,2
5046,women.workout.female.fitness,"very basic. this app has limited free options. there are many better, free workout comprehensive apps.",2
5047,women.workout.female.fitness,I really like the app but they charged two payments in the first month. I'm waiting for a response from them. I'll put 5 stars if they refund me.,2

5049,women.workout.female.fitness,Not good. It doesn't recognize physical conditions like post surgery workout...low impact workout etc. You don't have an option to enter the same.,2
5050,women.workout.female.fitness,I like the workouts but there are ads from the app popping up on everything I go on when I am off the app so that's very irritating.,2

5198,women.workout.female.fitness,I don't like this when you in a room before bed trying to do this doesn't help,2
5199,women.workout.female.fitness,nice,2
5200,women.workout.female.fitness,It is definitely one of the better fitness apps out there. You can customize the workout by substituting the exercises which is great if you have a bad back or knee. But I wish they allow me to add/subtract the number of exercises in the routine. I only give 3 stars because the ads shown are terrible. I understand ads are a necessary payment for the free service they provide. But they are horribly ostentious and sometimes even revolting. I wish they are more discerning and I know they can be.,3
5201,women.workout.female.fitness,"My only gripe with this app is that it doesn't seem beginner / unathletic person friendly. From what I can see, there is only 1 full-body workout plan and it ramps up in difficulty pretty fast with some exercises, like burpees & inchworms on day 3. I skip those almost completely because of my lack of ability. I wish that there were beginner, intermediate, and expert plans like some of their other apps, such as the yoga one.",3
5202,women.workout.female.fitness,"I don't like that you're required to watch a 30 second add before each workout, along with short add scattered around. They aren't terribly evasive but it does get annoying. Also it isn't always clear what the animation is doing and the descriptions aren't great if you aren't familiar with the exercise. Otherwise it's simple and has a good amount of choices so you can find a workout with out being overwhelmed. It's a good app for beginner but not if you're looking for something more advanced.",3
5203,women.workout.female.fitness,"Nice App, too many ads unfortunately, there's not too much of a switch option incase you're bored of the same repetitive exercises. It's a little on the fast side but thats just to demonstrate how to do said exercises. I've tried it for the past week and I'll be back to do another review/edit after a month. Stay Golden, Be Proud you started!",3
5204,women.workout.female.fitness,"I like the app but it always glitches half way through my routine an has no way to skip through the excise's to get back to where you left off. doesn't keep your program setting past a month if you don't keep up with it. doesn't have a way to keep multiple excise pages so you can change out instead of changes to the 1 page. this app could be so much more helpful if they could make it custamizable for each person to make for them selves, or add to it so it can have more. over all it helps.",3
5205,women.workout.female.fitness,"It's an okay app. I wish that when choosing a goal that the app would allow the person to choose 2 things instead of just 1. Only being able to choose 1 of the three options could mean that a person's workout isn't well rounded as it could be. I wanted to be able to choose both weight loss & muscle gain, but the app is designed so that only 1 of the 3 options can be chosen.",3
5206,women.workout.female.fitness,"I like the workouts, tips and pointers, as well as the available videos for extra guidance. However, I wish I didn't have to take the breaks in between, it creates a lot of extra stops to reach for my phone. I'd much rather just go from one excercise to another, and I can choose to take a minute to catch my breath if I want to.",3
5207,women.workout.female.fitness,It's alright. It does help me work out and lose weight but my only issue is that you have to watch ads before you work out. What type of work out app does that???,3
5208,women.workout.female.fitness,"I like this app as it helps me to actually do something at home doesn't require much space. I struggle with motivation, so starting with some 10-15 minute workouts helps with that. However, I selected all body areas to work on and seem to get all of them on there except ""arms beginner/advanced"". Arms intermediate is there with the others. There's also no obvious way to change what you're working on and no way to edit your profile. I'd like to see weight in stone on here too. Ads are annoying.",3
5209,women.workout.female.fitness,"Started using the app yesterday and I like it so far!! The adds aren't really a problem for me. Want the 3 seconds count before each exercise to be removed though(or a button where you can turn off it), it's kind of annoying, and please adjust the calorie count to be more accurate. I don't think that human can burn 200 calories in just 10 minutes by all honesty XD(plus it's in beginner mode)",3
5210,women.workout.female.fitness,"I love this app, but only gave it 3 stars because something seems to be wrong with it. Since the last update , when it's installed my phone keeps randomly restarting. I uninstalled all apps and re-added them one by one, the problem starts with this app. The mens version doesn't have this issue so I'm using it. It's a great app as well but doesn't offer cardio or stretching like the female version does.",3
5211,women.workout.female.fitness,"Loving the app. It is great for beginners. The 28 day challenge is perfect to encourage me to keep at it. And the ability to tweak the workouts, fabulous. But...I would love a diary option. A place to make comments about my daily progress or to record fitness I do outside the app (like walking and jogging) hey you give us pre and post workouts why not a means to record the actual walk/run??",3
5212,women.workout.female.fitness,Not bad. The workouts are easy to follow and easily extended if you want longer as well change of order. The calorie counter is completely wrong though. I used my own scales which measures calories burned and it was only a quarter of the number stated in the app-very misleading! So just divide the calories into 4 to get a true count. There are annoying 10 sec min advert videos that play at the start and end of each workout which is starting to get really annoying so am looking at other apps.,3
5213,women.workout.female.fitness,"It's good, just started it on June 17th. I'm only giving it 3 stars because the layout is a little complicated. It isn't how it looks on the advertisement. It doesnt have the diet plan or the chest workout and only has intermediate and not beginner or advanced for arm workouts. Please make it look like how It does on the advertisement. It also has adverts as soon as you finish a workout which is a little annoying. The workouts are good though. Update this and I will give 5 stars.",3
5214,women.workout.female.fitness,"The app is very useful and helpful to help you reach your fitness goal although I'd like for there to be an optional count or seconds feature that you can choose whenever you would like to use it in the full body section and also in the abs, arms, butt & thigh beginner, intermediate and advance section section, cos sometimes I don't always feel like counting, I'd prefer the app to be the coach all through, so I'd like for you to consider this as the next update please, thank you!",3
5215,women.workout.female.fitness,"It is amazing. I have never felt better. I have been looking for an amazing workout app and this is it! The only way that I think that you could improve it is make a setting where you can create your own workouts. Other than that, I feel fit and healthy. Edit- I had a break as i had to answer an email and it took around an hour. When i came back and finished it, it said that I had done around 2000 more burned calories. Please fix it.",3
5216,women.workout.female.fitness,It's really pretty good app...very helpful for fitness...I really like it...,3
5217,women.workout.female.fitness,"Good app, good workouts, but the lack of option to pay off the ads (like in other apps from this developer, Stretcing Exercises and Home Workout) is really annoying. The apps seem to share the same base code, so implementing this feature should be easy, yet it's suspiciously missing (and I've searched!). What is it? Deliberate marketing strategy against allowing women to make purchases in the app or something? -2 just for this, because I really want to get some attention and then an explanation.",3
5218,women.workout.female.fitness,"The app is very good and helpful But it has too much ads and some yogas and excersice won't open,it keeps showing that they are premium and then i have to use data to download some before they could work . So please helppppp. I promise to change back to 5 starsssssss üò©üò©",3
5219,women.workout.female.fitness,"Really great workouts and progression, only issue is there aren't any detailed notes on proper form so for some reason I kept hurting my lower back A LOT and couldn't figure out which particular exercise caused it. Unfortunately, having my back painfully freeze 3 times in so many months makes me averse to using the app. If you want to Google proper form for each exercise, it's a great app",3
5220,women.workout.female.fitness,Exercises are quick and effective for weight loss and that's what I like the most about this app. But since the app is specifically designed for women so it should include exercises to relieve menstrual cramps but I couldn't find a single exercise for the same. A new update should be brought that includes exercise routine for menstrual pain relief.,3
5221,women.workout.female.fitness,"I have been using this app for the last 4 months now and during these months I switched phones twice. Every time I switch phone I have to start all over again even though I was in the last 3 days of my challenge, it doesn't allow me to continue. There is nowhere I can sign in to continue with the challenge after switching phone. I wish there is an option for that.",3
5222,women.workout.female.fitness,"I can't believe this. I tried to unlock my 21st day of one of my workouts and the ad didn't work, it redirected me to the main menu every. Single. Time. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling and my whole progress is LOST, even with my Google account synced. I was completely fine before this. A whole disaster.",3
5223,women.workout.female.fitness,"I personally love the excercise modules this app provides. Been using this for everyday workouts- absolutely lovely! The issue I have with it though, is the calorie count- I'm certain it isn't possible to burn over 400 calories in a low-medium impact 15-20 minute routine, for example. The only thing I'd love for the developers to fix is this. We would not want to mislead people into thinking they're in a calorie deficit when they really aren't, right? Please fix. :)",3
5224,women.workout.female.fitness,"Limited, full of stereotypes about women. I downloaded this app because I liked the stretching all from the same company. But in this app it's so focused on stereotypes about women wanting to look thon and attractive, rather than experoence health benefits, that was very off putting for me. I am.nlt able to make custom routines like I can with the stretching app. I want everyday health and fitness, short term butt workouts. They should.make a more gender neutral app with customizable goals.",3
5225,women.workout.female.fitness,I loved it but the only thing which disturbs alot is to watching videos before to unlock exercises...i appreciate if the app goes totally free because it'll have chance to provide a great help concerning each and every person who's using this app!! I'm kindly requesting to also maintain some folder of dietary plans to eat what and not to üíúüíú,3
5226,women.workout.female.fitness,"Overall it is a good option for Home-based workout. I've been following it from past 4 months and the change in my body is noticeable. However I've seen some glitch in this app. It is miss calculating my workout duration for a whole week. For example in a week if I've worked out for 3 hours, it is showing as more than 4 hours. Don't know whether it is a glitch or anything, but thought to share here.",3
5227,women.workout.female.fitness,"I like the app as ot encourages easy work outs you can just do from home, great way to get in shape without spending the money. Yes the ads are annoying but after all the app is free! What brothers me more, especially as I use this app alongside my diet and calorie tracker, is that I do not think the burnt calorie amounts are correct. I'm not sure how a 6 minute stretching exercise before bed can burn 150 calories. Would love for someone to alert me how this is calculated",3
5228,women.workout.female.fitness,"This app has very few workouts... The ones they have are not very well organized. Some of the easy work outs are actually very hard and technical and intermediate to hard sometimes much less complicated. It's not a free app, so honestly it should offer more options of work outs. The voice prompts are decent",3
5229,women.workout.female.fitness,"Nice app, tried for first time today. Only feedback I have is to allow the app to accept voice signals to move to next workout, instead of the tick button in the middle of the screen. This is because while working out it is difficult to get up and click the tick button. So, if the voice signal is accepted then one is not bothered of clicking the tick, can just call out, DONE/ NEXT. :)",3
5230,women.workout.female.fitness,"Only had it for a day but so far I like the workouts. The ads are very annoying though. I get that its a free app so there will be ads, but you should introduce an ad-feee version people can pay for. Having an ad pop up in the middle of a workout really throws me off.",3
5231,women.workout.female.fitness,"All the work out are very good. I try to unlock the 28 days workout. After 14 days, the work out cannot open because the ad has issue. I try to uninstall and all my result is lost. I try the new work out and the same issue is happened. I send the feedback but I didn't receive any reply.",3
5232,women.workout.female.fitness,This app is good. Not great though... It only has a couple of workouts and thats it. There are other apps out there that are very cheap and they costimise workout plans and meal plans for you. This app just gives you a few workouts that you could make yourself with out taking up space on you phone.,3
5233,women.workout.female.fitness,I really like the layout of this app but I wish more options were offered in making my own workout plan or at least to allow me to add customized exercise. I wanted to save the youtube routines I have been following onto this app but in vain as very limited exercise options were given.,3
5234,women.workout.female.fitness,Its a bit irrigating because I do other exercises such as dance and run. The notifications are not motivating they kind of make you feel self conscious... maybe change that. Other than that the routines are great.,3
5235,women.workout.female.fitness,"So far in having this app for the past few weeks, I've enjoyed the variety of workouts and stretches it has to offer. One thing I find difficult is the time durations the workouts say before doing them. As a generally busy person, I have a hard time with this because I never know if I have enough time to do the workouts since the time duration it says on it is definitely inaccurate by at least 10 minutes. Is there a solution to maybe have the character do the workout along side you maybe?",3
5236,women.workout.female.fitness,"Good exercises and descriptions, but limited options, advanced sessions are just more reps and maybe one or 2 different exercises, gets repetitive after about 6 days. Also would be nice to have option that guidance graphic be changeable to POC or different body type depending on user preference.",3
5237,women.workout.female.fitness,The routines in this app feel like decent workouts and I can feel more/ different muscles being worked. The only reason I gave 3 stars instead of 5 is because I feel like the calories burned seem way too high for the amount of time. I've been doing boxing for months (one of the highest calorie burning exercises) and only burn about 400 calories in 45 min going all out. This app says I'm burning that in 20 minutes and I barely break a sweat. I just doubt the accuracy of the calorie estimate.,3
5238,women.workout.female.fitness,"It started out as a very good app; there are different exercises for each day until the first challenge is over. It doesn't give different exercises anymore and I'm forced to repeate the ones I've done before. I would have rated it a 5, but then it's no longer useful to me as it no longer challenges me.",3
5239,women.workout.female.fitness,"It's a really good app, but I wish it would connect with my fitbit. It's cool that it connects to google fit, I would also like to connect via fitbit. That would make things a little easier for fitbit users who don't use google fit. Overall, I really do like the app though.",3
5240,women.workout.female.fitness,"It was ok, kind of like every other exercising app. But you could do morning and night routines and it would categorize the workouts. The only reason I don't like this app is because it keep showing an ad that you can't get out of and it won't let you exit.",3
5241,women.workout.female.fitness,"It keeps changing my weight for no reason, at random. Plus, all the workouts contain similar exercises so there is a ton of repeating when you do more than one workout a day. Several times it just locked up after the workout & forgot that I did it. I'm hoping it will all be fixed soon.",3
5242,women.workout.female.fitness,"It might be a great app, but the excessive amount of ads have completely destroyed the time I used it. It is really not great that you can't do certain exercise routines unless you have watched a minute-long loud and uninteresting ad.",3
5243,women.workout.female.fitness,"It's a pretty good app. It's annoying that I have to watch ads for the same exercises that I do EVERY DAY. Sometimes I wish they had options for longer workouts. I downloaded this app to have strong muscles. I have neck and back pain, and they only give me a few routines for those. There needs to be a variety. I also find apps like this to be a tad bit sexist and fatphobic. I'm tired of the same exercises for the areas that I need. Why is there not a search feature?",3
5244,women.workout.female.fitness,Had to keep stopping to move the programme on. Needs an auto function so you can just go through everything without having to go back to your phone all the time. Also her voice is not motivational. But the exercises are good.,3
5245,women.workout.female.fitness,"Still early, is a good app but it only has cardio tyoe workouts and no body weight strength exercise regimes. The reminder i set only worked twice md hasn't reminded me aince even though it is still set to do so. It would be perfect if these two things were there and worked. üôÇ",3
5246,women.workout.female.fitness,Nice app but the only thing i do not understand is the calorie count after each workout...it seems completely wrong!! Also I would want to suggest something. I came here because it is a women fitness app so I was basically expecting it to have some consideration for our menstruation period for like some workout plans that are for everyday for 28 days but there maybe some women who are not able workout during their periods. So if there can be some solution for this and I hope you guys see this.,3
5247,women.workout.female.fitness,I love this app. Been using it off and on for a couple of years. Certain workouts still tend to make my muscles sore lol. The only thing I have a problem with is I got a new phone and lost all my data because there is no way to log into your old account. Ican't track my weight loss or all the workouts I have done. Can this please be fixed for the future.,3
5248,women.workout.female.fitness,"After every update this app gets worse, it doesnt correctly record the amount of calories that are burnt off after each session. The total amount of calories burnt off at the end of a week keeps decreasing when you reopen the app and check the calender. When you send an email to ask why these glitches are happening you get no response üò°. I love this app bcause its easy n workouts r fun but now its too frustrating. It shuldnt b difficult 2 make an app tht records calories accurately.",3
5249,women.workout.female.fitness,Pretty nice for a free app. Ads don't annoy as much as I expected. I like the workouts so far. What is appalling is the calorie count! How can you lose 78 calories for an 8-minute lower back stretch?! Come on...,3
5250,women.workout.female.fitness,Switched from the Lose Belly Fat from the same developers to this one. As others mentioned it seems to have an inaccurate calorie count. I also couldn't figure out how to transfer my data from the other app to this one via Google sync (not Google fit).,3
5251,women.workout.female.fitness,"The app is the best,it has music to keep you going but my problem is adverts,now it has stopped it doesn't wanna play. I'm kinda disappointed because I was looking forward to enjoy the benefits of this app. So for that I will only give 3 stars.",3
5252,women.workout.female.fitness,This gives only one month duration exercises which doesn't get intensive as days go by... The intensity of workout is not increasing.. It is same as it is in the beginning.. Anyway I liked it for the way it reminded and encouraged me to work out daily.. :-),3
5253,women.workout.female.fitness,"Great work out options. Does not sync with Google fit however, no matter how many times I try. Additionally, it doesn't offer the diet plans like advertised in photo.",3
5254,women.workout.female.fitness,"I have to rate this app three stars. The thing is, whenever I go into a work out that says "" beginner"" it really isn't beginner!! It is as hard as advanced!!! Some of the exercises are so hard, even though it says beginner friendly!!",3
5255,women.workout.female.fitness,"Definitely good for beginners but I used my fitness watch to track it aswell, and the time and calories never matched up. My watch always said I was at it for more time than the app did and the app says I should've burned like double the calories my watch says. So Definitely use something else to measure your actually activity with it. Update, to respond to the developers response...I think I'll trust my Samsung fit watch still.",3
5256,women.workout.female.fitness,"When im trying this app it only shows half of the routine i should do, for example when im trying full body work out there are 16 workout, but when i click start it only guide me for 5 workout, and some of it in repeat, like fire hydrant move at the beginning and the near the end, but there are no other workout like bird dog, heel touch etc even thought it is in the display (before i click start)",3
5257,women.workout.female.fitness,"Initially, i thought this app was awesome because of the variety of exercises to target different areas. However, after entering week 2 watching vjdeos does not unlock new exercises, so they are forcing you to purchase access I assume. So i uninstalled it and will look for another app.",3
5258,women.workout.female.fitness,"Good app for free, but where is the diet plan as seen in the app advertising photos? It's not in the app! Also can't find quarantine workout as shown in photos. Another note is the calorie count is way off. It says you've burnt much more calories than you really have.",3
5259,women.workout.female.fitness,"This app is pretty good. Earlier I have completed 7x4 full body and now a days I am doing splits. It helped me to lose my weight. Even I have recommended this app to my friends. One thing I want in this app is to add option of personalized training in which we can choose the exercises according to our needs, time availability and interest. Please add this option and no doubt this app would get 5 stars from every user. Thanks a lot.",3
5260,women.workout.female.fitness,"I've really enjoyed using this app for my quick after work sessions. My only problem is that the reminders don't work. They only pop up once you've opened the app, which kind of defeats the purpose. Please fix this asap!",3
5261,women.workout.female.fitness,"I finished 28 days workout but after that there is no means to move forward. I have to restart the progress which means whatever progress i have made till now is lost. Please don't limit the days, make it for 3 months or 6 months.",3
5262,women.workout.female.fitness,"It's a good app, but they should show you how to do the exercises. Also, too much stomping. I wish there were more options for getting the muscular body I want, not the hour glass shape.",3
5263,women.workout.female.fitness,"I am a week in and enjoy this app, but I wish you could customize exercises without overriding their presets. I would also like to see how many times I have completed each of the trainings and routines.",3
5264,women.workout.female.fitness,I don't think the timer is very accurate. I was working out for at least 30 minutes and it said I only did 20. I also wish it had the rep counter like your other app and the ability to see the workouts in advance. otherwise it is a good app it's just not for me,3
5265,women.workout.female.fitness,"I love this app it is helping me to lose some weight little by little but , everytime im clicking on some routines and click unlock and watch ads then after i use that routine and close the app when i re open it its says unlock again and i have to watch ads again.",3
5266,women.workout.female.fitness,It's good but the ads. Fix it please?? Even if I touch watch the ads to get the reward it ain't showing me an add and I can't do the particular workout. Annoying.,3
5267,women.workout.female.fitness,I started this app today. seems as though it's not tracking all the workouts I've done. I did them all and it showed them all until I did the sleepy time app then a few of my workouts disappeared like I didn't do them at all....I really like the workouts but I want to track my progress.,3
5268,women.workout.female.fitness,I really want to love this app. It's great for poeple who either don't have the time or the money to join a gym but still want to get in shape. My problem is the fact that all of my progress was erased when I transferred the app over to a new phone.,3
5269,women.workout.female.fitness,"The workouts are good its just that fact that you constanlty get pictures of petite white women who have 0 body fat and big butts that don't match that's so unrealistic. Also the part which tells you if your over weight or not is wrong. Your ""perfect"" body weight is determined by race, height, genetice, diet, etc. If these specific adjustments are made then maybe this app can get to a 4 or 5 star. My advise to anypone using this app? Only use is as a workout. Ignore everything else!",3
5270,women.workout.female.fitness,"I want to gain weight, and I won't find any section for this that is really disappointing. However, I like the simplified form and arrangements of every step.",3
5271,women.workout.female.fitness,I like the variety in the work outs. I wish you could turn the in app music off and play music from another app.,3
5272,women.workout.female.fitness,"I saw this app on play store and the only reason why I downloaded it was because in the play store,it showed "" chest"" as a target that you can choose to do. After downloaded it, I was very disappointed to find not only that the "" chest"" workout is not there,but the pictures shown in play store were not even the same. On playstore, it showed meal plan, but there was none.Please fix this. I really want to try the chest workout and meal plan. Thx",3
5273,women.workout.female.fitness,The calories that are being burned are not fixed. I am doing some exercises twice or more but the calories that are being burned varies. Now I'm not sure if I do burn 1k cal a day or what but it is still the best app I found for home work out. Thank youuu. More power ‚ù§,3
5274,women.workout.female.fitness,I guess this app would be good for beginners. Even the advanced workouts are nothing. Rest periods between workouts are too long and app over calculates calories burned.,3
5275,women.workout.female.fitness,"Good work outs with different levels.. Voice coach is nice but I really hate that I can't sync it with Samsung Health. If I could sync, it would have 5 stars.",3
5276,women.workout.female.fitness,"Love it, but the month challenge doesn't reset once you finish the first month so your only option is to get redoing day 28 over and over. would be great to have a new full body challenge because now my only option is to do specific body workouts and not a full body",3
5277,women.workout.female.fitness,"it could be...great! I wouldn't know since it wouldn't let me pass without have to set a reminder, and I don't need one. it would be lovely if that was optional!",3
5278,women.workout.female.fitness,Its helpful until you have to watch the ads. I have been stuck on day 2 for over a week now because the ad that should not be in a health and wellness video won't load.,3
5279,women.workout.female.fitness,The voice (instructor) goes through the exercises far too fast and the voice gives no instructions for correct body position or proper breathing. For someone with aspergers syn.it can be a piss off,3
5280,women.workout.female.fitness,"Good app, but I have an issue where some of the workouts have disappeared entirely (in particular, arm beginner and arm advanced) and I can't work out what to do to get them back.",3
5281,women.workout.female.fitness,The app was good at first when i just wanted to get in shape after i finished the app i swiched to toning but after i finished i saw no results. üò•,3
5282,women.workout.female.fitness,It is fine but the courses have not any warm up exercises. And eventually it get start with hard exercises. This may affect and damage our bodies. Pkease add some warm up moves in the beginning of each day course.,3
5283,women.workout.female.fitness,"Missing Features? I do not see a place for my progress and I cannot find the healthy recipes. I wonder if that comes with the paid upgrade. If it does, that was not stated in the advertisement that I saw anywhere. If I'm just overlooking it, it's not easy to find. Thanks!",3
5284,women.workout.female.fitness,"Need more stretching exercise, eye exercise, exercise to fasten running speed. And mostly a feature to decide users to customize and save their workout. Bring new workouts so it doesn't get boring.",3
5285,women.workout.female.fitness,"Its a really nice app with lots of workout options for different things like morning stretches, before and after run stretches i would give it a 5 but its a 3 because u can only do a workout after watching ads which is really annoying",3
5286,women.workout.female.fitness,It's a good app but I am finding it difficult to do some of the exercises because of my neck. The app doesn't allow for tailoring routines so that I can avoid these exercises,3
5287,women.workout.female.fitness,So far it's been a great experience using the app. No push ads for any paid service. I am quite satisfied for now. Just waiting to see if the suggested workouts will finally give some results,3
5288,women.workout.female.fitness,"Good app for routine use. I like it's tool for edit each training and personal profile. But I need seperate programs for shoulder, back and chest and it just has the arm day.",3
5289,women.workout.female.fitness,It would be a great app if one would be able to pay for the specific exercises in premium instead of paying for other exercises that you dont need.,3
5290,women.workout.female.fitness,My app suddenly stopped working whenever I wanted to open one of the workouts. It's really frustrating because I have been religiously following the workouts for some time now. Please help!,3
5291,women.workout.female.fitness,"Would love an option to have friends connected so we can see each other's progress and get notified when someone is working out so it can encourage us to stay motivated. A workout timeline that you can comment on etc would be great, something simple along the lines of a facebook timeline",3
5292,women.workout.female.fitness,It was all great actually it was also fun L L L I'll Aml,3
5293,women.workout.female.fitness,My app always uses data and after day one I always have to watch an add or pay ans my breast lift since day one the only option was to pay so I couldn't continue to use it,3
5294,women.workout.female.fitness,I can't get back to where I was in the workout. I wanted to change the settings on it mid workout and the app just started the workout all over.,3
5295,women.workout.female.fitness,I have given for 4 stars because because it should also have a diet plan because if we eat more so what is the profit of losing and losing the weight if you are eating more and more so how we can lose our weight so please add a diet plan to and the drinking also because in some and some of the AV there is drinking notification also that when we have to drink the water but here there is no drinking notification so please at the drinking notification and this app will be better because of two t,3
5296,women.workout.female.fitness,"I really love this app for long time ago so i buy it to premium before for lifetime, but now it require subscribtion again and no choice for lifetime, hmmm a lil bit sad for that:(",3
5297,women.workout.female.fitness,"It's my go to when I don't feel like lifting weights so for that the 5 stars, minus 1 because if I do the same workout a week apart it's about a 300 calorie difference and no explanation why. So for that minus 1 star. I swear the workout I did just now was way more intense than the last 600 almost 700 cal burned I did last week, and to my surprise it says I only burned roughly 400!!! WHY!!!!???? It really makes me second guess the app. I know it's a rough estimate but c mon!!",3
5298,women.workout.female.fitness,Its a good app for getting yourself up and doing something. My only complaint is that the calorie measurements are highly incorrect. Doing a 12 minute arm workout isn't going to burn 285 calories.,3
5299,women.workout.female.fitness,"I love the app but the calorie calculation is completely off. I did a light workout for 7 minutes (7x4 challenge) but the app showed that I burned 189 calories. I'm 155 cm with weight 48 kg, so that's impossible.",3
5300,women.workout.female.fitness,"It's okay. But after paying for it, it has a small limit of workouts and not a lot of ways to get random workouts to challenge yourself.",3
5301,women.workout.female.fitness,If there were an option to back up data that would be great. I changed phones recently and lost all my progress.,3
5302,women.workout.female.fitness,It is a good app but it i don't think it deserves 4.9 stars. It has very little amount of reps so it doesn't make me tired at all which won't give me the results that i want. I can see why people like but it just wasn't what i thought it was and it disappointed me.,3
5303,women.workout.female.fitness,I downloaded this app because of diet plan too... But am unable to find that... What's wrong ?..In pictures it's showing diet plan too... Am disappointed... Due to this am giving only 3 stars... Maybe m not able to reach in that option... Help me please!!,3
5304,women.workout.female.fitness,The work out times is not correct. 5 minutes work out is really 9 Minutes. Tired to do a 5 minutes workout on my break and it took me 9 minutes. I also tried the 10 Minutes and it goes for 14 minutes.,3
5305,women.workout.female.fitness,the calories burned seem a bit high - I'm not sure I can burn 400 calories from 2 short workouts! Otherwise easy to use app and good work out selection!,3
5306,women.workout.female.fitness,"It is a very good App but the ""Sync to Google Fit"" doesn't work. I sent feedback about this a while ago and it still isn't fixed.",3
5307,women.workout.female.fitness,Did app is a very full app I recommend this app very much but the there is only one thing about this app that I do not really like which is how they say we burned 200 kcal in 10 min doing the full workout I used a fit bit and I did exactly what they said I only lost 52 kcal.,3
5308,women.workout.female.fitness,Its just my 3rd day doing exercise in this.. Exercises are good but it isn't allowing to do some exercises without upgrading into premium which u found irritating..,3
5309,women.workout.female.fitness,"Good exercices, but its really for beginner. Nothing intensif here. I had to switch some exercise like the knee pushups to real pushups. And many more. Please can you put some more advance routines and workout?",3
5310,women.workout.female.fitness,Was enjoying the app. Then I had to change phones and when I installed it again the option to edit which exercises to add to workouts and which to remove was gone. Is this a new feature?,3
5311,women.workout.female.fitness,"A pretty good app, but it would be great to include a motivating music playlist to accompany the workouts and make them more enjoyable",3
5312,women.workout.female.fitness,"I love this app, it's great. But lately i've been having trouble with the voice controls. All i hear is a buzzing noice.",3
5313,women.workout.female.fitness,"The app is good but you'll have to watch ad to open each excercise. It is good that ads are only in starting but otherwise, it is insane to watch one ad for 12min excercise",3
5314,women.workout.female.fitness,the app is wonderful. though an extra feature of creating our own work out from the existing exercises would be amazing.,3
5315,women.workout.female.fitness,It was actually okay but I just don't like the ad that came with the app. So everytime I open my phone an ad will pop out. Kindly fix that please.,3
5316,women.workout.female.fitness,I would give you guys 5 stars had the app not locked me out of everything every time I entered after no use for a whole day. Please fix this problem! Thanks!!,3
5317,women.workout.female.fitness,"I mean, so far so good.. I really like the set up. I like the exercises. I just started so I'll rate more when I see results. Its only been 2 days this far.",3
5318,women.workout.female.fitness,"I'm a little bit concerned in the countdown in transitioning, in between the rest and the routine there is two countdown each in three seconds. Should it be only one?",3
5319,women.workout.female.fitness,"I wish there was an option just for everyday exercise, just staying healthy. For those who are happy with there weight but just want to stay healthy and fit.",3
5320,women.workout.female.fitness,"It was fun for the first week of doing it, and then I got bored. It's very repetitious and this is not an app for people who get bored easily. Plus, I'd like to see arm workouts added. Thanks.",3
5321,women.workout.female.fitness,Working out and all is ok but were is the meal and diat plan you guys show in the ads ? Where it is? I can only see and enjoy working out! No doubt that the work out plan and reminder is brilliant but i was hoping to get a meal plan also,3
5322,women.workout.female.fitness,Its a good application but the drawbacks are it has very difficult excersise... That seem to be humanly impossible and you have to watch a video to unlock the excersise videos,3
5323,women.workout.female.fitness,I am giving 3stars because when I am doing abb beginning exercise i saw that after completing exercise we have to go and touched their then next exercise come if you keep how many crunches are given to do next exercise change automatically I suggest that afterall good please change that one in this app then I give you 5stars,3
5324,women.workout.female.fitness,I don't know about the app but is very useful I used to do the every time they is helping to weight loss and there is so interested to do the exercise in our home,3
5325,women.workout.female.fitness,It's a good app. You can feel the difference in 2 days but too much add. After first time ubhave to watch adds to unlock 2 day or 3 day challenges.,3
5326,women.workout.female.fitness,"would be a 5 star but this new silent 3 second countdown is a pain - why have one aloud, with a whistle blow, only to do it again? thought the app had frozen! please fix so I can update to 5*",3
5327,women.workout.female.fitness,"Hi It use to be a very good app, but after updating there seems to be a bad background noise. Can you please fix it.",3
5328,women.workout.female.fitness,"it is good but in some workouts, you have to watch a video to unlock and it is very confusing in the weight part",3
5329,women.workout.female.fitness,"bad calorie estimates. like, 9 minute thigh workout for 120 lb female is 217 calories? nooooo. aside from this, awesome app with helpful demos and customizable workouts.",3
5330,women.workout.female.fitness,"Great app, but mostly useless on a small screen. It would be an instant hit if it supported Android TV (Nvidia Shield, et. al.)",3
5331,women.workout.female.fitness,It's a very good app and i like that there are exercises to help build all parts or particular parts of the body.,3
5332,women.workout.female.fitness,it was realy good they could use a softer voice if you want to make a rutine you can if you wabt you can stop in the middle for a 30 minuet break if you are tierd or if you dont want to do it if you dont like this app then ok,3
5333,women.workout.female.fitness,Bought this app a while back. Now it just keeps crashing in the middle of a workout. Very disappointed.,3
5334,women.workout.female.fitness,"Hi, it's a great. App But please help me get the tempo an counting in this. As I am not able to track what's the count I'm doing while exercising.please help",3
5335,women.workout.female.fitness,I like it. But it would be better if you had the option to add support for galaxy wear products or at least link workout to samsung health.,3
5336,women.workout.female.fitness,"The app is good and helpful,i am able to see changes but some routines where not opening that i had to open a video, where can i find it??",3
5337,women.workout.female.fitness,"a little misleading, there are no upperbody workouts and no diet tabs. its great overall but is missing some promised features",3
5338,women.workout.female.fitness,I've tried a lot of apps for weight loss & by far this is the best one but as I'm just a beginner l'll cone back after a few months and give u 5 stars;))),3
5339,women.workout.female.fitness,It's a great app but I skip it once or twice and it still counts as i burned those calories...it brings my Hope's up then i realize it's not true...man üòëüò™,3
5340,women.workout.female.fitness,Hii please reply me in return Actually i m 12 years old and i dont want really hard exercise which will effect my hieght and all that so is it okay if i will do these exercises? I want full body exercises And i want to get in shape so i can't find that option to get in shape which is shown in the photo There is only 3 options to get stronger and more 2 i can't remember so pls help me out with this,3
5341,women.workout.female.fitness,It doesn't explain anywhere that it is definitely not for beginners! If you haven't exercised for a few month you will probably not be able to do any of it!,3
5342,women.workout.female.fitness,I like the workouts BUT it overestimates the calories you burn by at least 3 to 4 times more than you are actually burning. This can be extremely problematic for someone trying to loose weight especially for a medical condition. 7M women estimates calories much better.,3
5343,women.workout.female.fitness,"App it self is gr8,I enjoy it but why is there no option to sync with my Samsung health,I will continue using this app but I hope to see a improvement soon",3
5344,women.workout.female.fitness,"I cannot edit the excercise count, time for 28 day workout plan. Once I save the edited plan and press start it goes back to original. Kindly go through the same",3
5345,women.workout.female.fitness,Too many invasive ads ..... otherwise fine,3
5346,women.workout.female.fitness,Nice. I love working out because i want to look nice (im already slim and a little curvy though) and other always tell me I look amazing but i want to feel amazing not just look it! :) perfect to do that.,3
5347,women.workout.female.fitness,having to watch a dumb ass ad every single time I wanna stretch is annoying. y'all know it's annoying so why the hell would y'all do that??? it ABSOLUTELY KILLS the joy of stretching honestly. I'm doneüôÑü§¨,3
5348,women.workout.female.fitness,"Just remove the adds, can't deal with them. I have to watch a video to do the workout. Its not really the idea",3
5349,women.workout.female.fitness,"I'm falling love with this application,üòç but the Ads are really annoying and I'm not interested in buying premium so that's I'm give this application 3 star's üåü",3
5350,women.workout.female.fitness,"Too many exercises, repeat exercises each day. I don't like that I have to customize everyday.",3
5351,women.workout.female.fitness,Beneficial but some workout are same such as there should be different exercises for abs and booty but some remains same and should modify this app and new workouts should be added.,3
5352,women.workout.female.fitness,I think it's a great workout app. I really appreciate it but there should be also some workouts for other body parts.,3
5353,women.workout.female.fitness,"I started this workout, but after 1 day a premium subscription was required to proceed. Very disappointing.",3
5354,women.workout.female.fitness,"I really enjoy using this but too many ads, I would pay for a decent workout app without any advert....",3
5355,women.workout.female.fitness,"Earlier, sets for exercising used to change daily. Now I see same exercises every day be it any challenge. Can you please specify why it has changed?",3
5356,women.workout.female.fitness,"I would give 5 stars but today when I went to a routine it said watch video to unlock, then no video would play so it wouldn't unlock which is really aggravating. Can't I just pay for this app so I don't have to watch a video to unlock something?",3
5357,women.workout.female.fitness,Ad for some exercise but why you not making download system 1 to 100 instead of ad because ads hangs the phone. l love all the things in this but why ad that is the problem and why is not asking for age,3
5358,women.workout.female.fitness,"It is pretty cool but... doesn't have exercise for chest and inner thigs and legs, or for the back, and only one for arms.",3
5359,women.workout.female.fitness,I Like the app but would love to link my fitbit or even link from my phone to comptuter would be great also point would be awesome for lile gift cards to promo health and fitness,3
5360,women.workout.female.fitness,This is helpfull exercise but i have an problem from this that is....while iam doing exercise from two days my backside above knee there is only paining not at any other place only that place both legs are paining is it help full or should i live this exercise...please reply sir or Mam,3
5361,women.workout.female.fitness,The app doesn't count right amount of calories burnt it just thinks if u spend more time u burn more calories. I accidentally left the exercise open and it was showing 3000+calories burnt,3
5362,women.workout.female.fitness,"It does not tell you how to do it and does not execute the specifics you give and has no part for gain weight But, hast sevral exercise , for arm, for stomach, fot buttacks , ... And its good",3
5363,women.workout.female.fitness,I love the application but it makes my phone slow. I have to force stop the application in order to have the prior experience.,3
5364,women.workout.female.fitness,Nice app I am donig it but it is not intersting only same exersizes everyday please do everyday exercise different like rest day and exercise day and in exercise day you have to give few or more exercise. And my weight is not loosing it going upwards only.üôÑüòíüò§üò†üò°,3
5365,women.workout.female.fitness,Good app but only one exersize is free for do,3
5366,women.workout.female.fitness,"Good app,but when I finished the first 4 weeks,had to go back and to start from beginning.why there is no option to continue?",3
5367,women.workout.female.fitness,I love this app as I has a visual as well as audio guidance on how to expercise.,3
5368,women.workout.female.fitness,It would be great if there were exercises that did not require floor work. My knees and hips are swollen and painful. Any suggestions,3
5369,women.workout.female.fitness,i will pay to get rid of afs if that was an option. i hate it so mich that this app and the kill belly fat app had ads and no way to get rid of it.,3
5370,women.workout.female.fitness,It is a wonderful app,3
5371,women.workout.female.fitness,I like this app but everything premium even 7√ó4 challenge. Just first day free then premium and can't open exercises.,3
5372,women.workout.female.fitness,"Umm. It doesn't have face , double chin exercises . It also doesn't have specifically chest exercises for women. Rest is good",3
5373,women.workout.female.fitness,"Its a good workout app, however counts double of actual calories burned which is very misleading.",3
5374,women.workout.female.fitness,It does work but my bowel went into a double I have no clue why...the upper abdominal did the abs..but the lower went opposite. So I stopped,3
5375,women.workout.female.fitness,It's very helpful for beginners... I face hard time to understand it's mechanisms in the *routine* area,3
5376,women.workout.female.fitness,Has great exercises. I'm not a fan of exercise so I wish it had a way to be group inclusive.,3
5377,women.workout.female.fitness,I give it a 3 star because when im in a hurry to go to work and i have to excersice i have to download n watch an ad first and really annoying,3
5378,women.workout.female.fitness,its gud but the exercises which r locked need to be unlocked by watching a video and that video will not load for eternity....but otherwise its gud,3
5379,women.workout.female.fitness,Everything in this app is quite good but muscle gain option is not available. Please try to fix.,3
5380,women.workout.female.fitness,"Had to wait minutes to be able to download a fast workout and watch as it stops halfway, does it have to be a staring contest now?",3
5381,women.workout.female.fitness,I have completed my 30days challenge but now it is showing same exercise daily how to continue this exercise daily with same exercise.,3
5382,women.workout.female.fitness,"I would like more 7x4 challenges to be available in the free version. The men have it in their free version, why don't we?",3
5383,women.workout.female.fitness,Cool app and workouts are good. One round of the workout is not enough.,3
5384,women.workout.female.fitness,"The calender has an extra day written on it for November 2018. Please update, calendar is incorrect.",3
5385,women.workout.female.fitness,"This is a really great app, but it will be better for kids if there was more of a variety of workouts!!",3
5386,women.workout.female.fitness,It helped me ....but currently i have switched to another weight loss app...since i felt this app had a limited exercises ...any way ..it was not that badüëçüèª,3
5387,women.workout.female.fitness,"exercises are quite good, and makes me sweat! but i have a confusion does it help to gain weight? or it is only for the weight loss?",3
5388,women.workout.female.fitness,"This appis very nice but if you can sdd featured likd- Glowing face, Knock knees, Bow- Legs etc.......... But still keep it up LEAP FITNESS GROUP!",3
5389,women.workout.female.fitness,It's a good app but after awhile it's only some random and repetitive moves!not pro!,3
5390,women.workout.female.fitness,please remove the 3 sec wait time after the 30 second rest time. please. otherwise the app is okay. thank you!,3
5391,women.workout.female.fitness,i dont really see my body change at all but i think the exrsize is good for me tho but i need a better app to make me lose wait more soon and this app is not helping me,3
5392,women.workout.female.fitness,"if you work hard then this app can help you, yiu have to br hardworker, but it's a very important app for workout, check this ap out",3
5393,women.workout.female.fitness,I rate 3 stars because your calorie counting is wrong. But your exercises are good.,3
5394,women.workout.female.fitness,"Nice and easy app, but I didn't see any of the Health Tips like it advertised in the store (which is part of the reason why I downloaded this app specifically). Did I miss something?",3
5395,women.workout.female.fitness,still the instructions can be more louder and clear otherwise the best app to reduce weight good graphic explanation,3
5396,women.workout.female.fitness,It is a really nice app to get slim..bt in this app there are very difficult exercises which I can't do...,3
5397,women.workout.female.fitness,This app is very nice like this I have very much but today I start but I find where is my food diet chart but I have not find my food chart chart I want food that chat because I want to follow the food that chat at want to be sleeve any idea how to get the food chart,3
5398,women.workout.female.fitness,I loved the app but the only problem was that the diet plan which is shown in the pictures was not in the appüòî,3

5400,women.workout.female.fitness,Perfect,3

5405,women.workout.female.fitness,It's alright,3
5406,women.workout.female.fitness,It's alright. It does help me work out and lose weight but my only issue is that you have to watch ads before you work out. What type of work out app does that???,3
5407,women.workout.female.fitness,It was all great actually it was also fun L L L I'll Aml,3
5408,women.workout.female.fitness,Nice app,3

5422,women.workout.female.fitness,Does this app have workout for girls with PCOS?,3
5423,women.workout.female.fitness,"It's a good app, but they should show you how to do the exercises. Also, too much stomping. I wish there were more options for getting the muscular body I want, not the hour glass shape.",3
5424,women.workout.female.fitness,It would be a great app if one would be able to pay for the specific exercises in premium instead of paying for other exercises that you dont need.,3

5432,women.workout.female.fitness,Nice app it helps to make body slim,3
5433,women.workout.female.fitness,Not good app and not bad app,3
5434,women.workout.female.fitness,It's a very good app and i like that there are exercises to help build all parts or particular parts of the body.,3

5440,women.workout.female.fitness,"Hi It use to be a very good app, but after updating there seems to be a bad background noise. Can you please fix it.",3
5441,women.workout.female.fitness,I wish they were personalized.,3
5442,women.workout.female.fitness,Some of these I can't do,3
5443,women.workout.female.fitness,Bought this app a while back. Now it just keeps crashing in the middle of a workout. Very disappointed.,3
5444,women.workout.female.fitness,I have problem with ads .. the workout didn't work after ads,3
5445,women.workout.female.fitness,"It's an amazing app, it's working even for beginners also.... üëç",3
5446,women.workout.female.fitness,I am not able to find diet plan in the app,3
5447,women.workout.female.fitness,This is exactly what I have been looking for. It's doable.,3
5448,women.workout.female.fitness,Had to keep stopping to move the programme on. Needs an auto function so you can just go through everything without having to go back to your phone all the time. Also her voice is not motivational. But the exercises are good.,3
5449,women.workout.female.fitness,Very nice,3
5450,women.workout.female.fitness,It's good but the ads. Fix it please?? Even if I touch watch the ads to get the reward it ain't showing me an add and I can't do the particular workout. Annoying.,3
5451,women.workout.female.fitness,Switched from the Lose Belly Fat from the same developers to this one. As others mentioned it seems to have an inaccurate calorie count. I also couldn't figure out how to transfer my data from the other app to this one via Google sync (not Google fit).,3
5452,women.workout.female.fitness,Not a nice app but it ask for premium for 2 day exercise and many adds So very very bad app,3
5453,women.workout.female.fitness,Its just my 3rd day doing exercise in this.. Exercises are good but it isn't allowing to do some exercises without upgrading into premium which u found irritating..,3
5454,women.workout.female.fitness,Awesome,3
5455,women.workout.female.fitness,"This app has very few workouts... The ones they have are not very well organized. Some of the easy work outs are actually very hard and technical and intermediate to hard sometimes much less complicated. It's not a free app, so honestly it should offer more options of work outs. The voice prompts are decent",3
5456,women.workout.female.fitness,Can't wait to try it.,3
5457,women.workout.female.fitness,"The app is the best,it has music to keep you going but my problem is adverts,now it has stopped it doesn't wanna play. I'm kinda disappointed because I was looking forward to enjoy the benefits of this app. So for that I will only give 3 stars.",3
5458,women.workout.female.fitness,"I started this workout, but after 1 day a premium subscription was required to proceed. Very disappointing.",3
5459,women.workout.female.fitness,"Definitely good for beginners but I used my fitness watch to track it aswell, and the time and calories never matched up. My watch always said I was at it for more time than the app did and the app says I should've burned like double the calories my watch says.

5460,women.workout.female.fitness,I love this app i have seen some progress from using this app but i want this app to add a small waist workout,3
5461,women.workout.female.fitness,It's OK,3
5462,women.workout.female.fitness,"My only gripe with this app is that it doesn't seem beginner / unathletic person friendly. From what I can see, there is only 1 full-body workout plan and it ramps up in difficulty pretty fast with some exercises, like burpees & inchworms on day 3. I skip those almost completely because of my lack of ability. I wish that there were beginner, intermediate, and expert plans like some of their other apps, such as the yoga one.",3
5463,women.workout.female.fitness,It's good but i cant find chest realated workout here bring it as soon as possible,3
5464,women.workout.female.fitness,Is this aap is free or not,3
5465,women.workout.female.fitness,Good,3

5475,women.workout.female.fitness,Good,3
5476,women.workout.female.fitness,the reason why i gave it a three star is because the work outs are good but i dont like how the tell you if you're big or if your small and to say big they say obese like really im here to lose weight not have a title,3
5477,women.workout.female.fitness,OK good,3
5478,women.workout.female.fitness,Great app,3
5479,women.workout.female.fitness,"It might be a great app, but the excessive amount of ads have completely destroyed the time I used it. It is really not great that you can't do certain exercise routines unless you have watched a minute-long loud and uninteresting ad.",3
5480,women.workout.female.fitness,Such a wonderful app,3
5481,women.workout.female.fitness,"The app is very useful and helpful to help you reach your fitness goal although I'd like for there to be an optional count or seconds feature that you can choose whenever you would like to use it in the full body section and also in the abs, arms, butt & thigh beginner, intermediate and advance section section, cos sometimes I don't always feel like counting, I'd prefer the app to be the coach all through, so I'd like for you to consider this as the next update please, thank you!",3
5482,women.workout.female.fitness,I just want to gain weight..will it help me,3
5483,women.workout.female.fitness,It doesn't explain anywhere that it is definitely not for beginners! If you haven't exercised for a few month you will probably not be able to do any of it!,3
5484,women.workout.female.fitness,Didn't work,3
5485,women.workout.female.fitness,"Earlier, sets for exercising used to change daily. Now I see same exercises every day be it any challenge. Can you please specify why it has changed?",3
5486,women.workout.female.fitness,‚ú®‚ú®üëèüèª,3
5487,women.workout.female.fitness,Wow i really love it Gives you a stress free world,3
5488,women.workout.female.fitness,"a little misleading, there are no upperbody workouts and no diet tabs. its great overall but is missing some promised features",3
5489,women.workout.female.fitness,thnku for fitness,3
5490,women.workout.female.fitness,It really worked in my life.,3
5491,women.workout.female.fitness,6month,3
5492,women.workout.female.fitness,I'd give this app 5 stars if yoga and pilates were included. Bummer!,3
5493,women.workout.female.fitness,It's a great app and I'm having the best experience so far,3
5494,women.workout.female.fitness,Everything in this app is quite good but muscle gain option is not available. Please try to fix.,3
5495,women.workout.female.fitness,Its helpful until you have to watch the ads. I have been stuck on day 2 for over a week now because the ad that should not be in a health and wellness video won't load.,3
5496,women.workout.female.fitness,"All the work out are very good. I try to unlock the 28 days workout. After 14 days, the work out cannot open because the ad has issue. I try to uninstall and all my result is lost. I try the new work out and the same issue is happened. I send the feedback but I didn't receive any reply.",3
5497,women.workout.female.fitness,Love it üòä,3
5498,women.workout.female.fitness,I give it a 3 star because when im in a hurry to go to work and i have to excersice i have to download n watch an ad first and really annoying,3
5499,women.workout.female.fitness,There was no deit plan,3
5500,women.workout.female.fitness,Llmllllopl0pƒ∫lƒ∫ Poll P ƒπƒ∫,3
5501,women.workout.female.fitness,Great app but it's taking long to download videos,3
5502,women.workout.female.fitness,I was here for diet plans but seems that there are none . Where can I access them ? I am awaitingly Looking forward for the plans you have .,3
5503,women.workout.female.fitness,I love this app,3
5504,women.workout.female.fitness,"Too many exercises, repeat exercises each day. I don't like that I have to customize everyday.",3
5505,women.workout.female.fitness,Great app love it.,3
5506,women.workout.female.fitness,I love this app,3
5507,women.workout.female.fitness,It's a great up,3
5508,women.workout.female.fitness,I think it's a great app but it freezers on my phone that's why I gave it 3 üåü it's great but 3 is limit,3
5509,women.workout.female.fitness,All this app are good if you be consistent,3
5510,women.workout.female.fitness,Well i am lazy but this app have nice excercise to do üëåüèª,3
5511,women.workout.female.fitness,"I've really enjoyed using this app for my quick after work sessions. My only problem is that the reminders don't work. They only pop up once you've opened the app, which kind of defeats the purpose. Please fix this asap!",3
5512,women.workout.female.fitness,"Exercises r good ,u can be fit that to free of cost,two stars less is because of ads",3
5513,women.workout.female.fitness,Long time ads too annoying,3
5514,women.workout.female.fitness,Good,3
5515,women.workout.female.fitness,"I can't believe this. I tried to unlock my 21st day of one of my workouts and the ad didn't work, it redirected me to the main menu every. Single. Time. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling and my whole progress is LOST, even with my Google account synced. I was completely fine before this. A whole disaster.",3
5516,women.workout.female.fitness,"The app's good, but where's the diet plan mentioned in the images?",3
5517,women.workout.female.fitness,"Umm. It doesn't have face , double chin exercises . It also doesn't have specifically chest exercises for women. Rest is good",3
5518,women.workout.female.fitness,Overall excitement,3
5519,women.workout.female.fitness,"Had to wait minutes to be able to download a fast workout and watch as it stops halfway, does it have to be a staring contest now?",3
5520,women.workout.female.fitness,It's very helpful,3
5521,women.workout.female.fitness,A very good app .it works well,3
5522,women.workout.female.fitness,I love‚ù£Ô∏è this app it help me to lose weight I recommend you use this app it will help you too,3
5523,women.workout.female.fitness,So good,3
5524,women.workout.female.fitness,"The app is good but you'll have to watch ad to open each excercise. It is good that ads are only in starting but otherwise, it is insane to watch one ad for 12min excercise",3
5525,women.workout.female.fitness,Good,3
5526,women.workout.female.fitness,"This app is pretty good. Earlier I have completed 7x4 full body and now a days I am doing splits. It helped me to lose my weight. Even I have recommended this app to my friends. One thing I want in this app is to add option of personalized training in which we can choose the exercises according to our needs, time availability and interest. Please add this option and no doubt this app would get 5 stars from every user. Thanks a lot.",3
5527,women.workout.female.fitness,"Really great workouts and progression, only issue is there aren't any detailed notes on proper form so for some reason I kept hurting my lower back A LOT and couldn't figure out which particular exercise caused it. Unfortunately, having my back painfully freeze 3 times in so many months makes me averse to using the app. If you want to Google proper form for each exercise, it's a great app",3
5528,women.workout.female.fitness,I loved it but the only thing which disturbs alot is to watching videos before to unlock exercises...i appreciate if the app goes totally free because it'll have chance to provide a great help concerning each and every person who's using this app!! I'm kindly requesting to also maintain some folder of dietary plans to eat what and not to üíúüíú,3
5529,women.workout.female.fitness,Thi thak hai,3
5530,women.workout.female.fitness,Excillent,3
5531,women.workout.female.fitness,"I don't like that you're required to watch a 30 second add before each workout, along with short add scattered around. They aren't terribly evasive but it does get annoying. Also it isn't always clear what the animation is doing and the descriptions aren't great if you aren't familiar with the exercise. Otherwise it's simple and has a good amount of choices so you can find a workout with out being overwhelmed. It's a good app for beginner but not if you're looking for something more advanced.",3
5532,women.workout.female.fitness,‚ù§Ô∏è,3
5533,women.workout.female.fitness,"It's a great app no need for payment, really helping matters here.",3
5534,women.workout.female.fitness,"It started out as a very good app; there are different exercises for each day until the first challenge is over. It doesn't give different exercises anymore and I'm forced to repeate the ones I've done before. I would have rated it a 5, but then it's no longer useful to me as it no longer challenges me.",3
5535,women.workout.female.fitness,"Its a really nice app with lots of workout options for different things like morning stretches, before and after run stretches i would give it a 5 but its a 3 because u can only do a workout after watching ads which is really annoying",3
5536,women.workout.female.fitness,This app is very nice like this I have very much but today I start but I find where is my food diet chart but I have not find my food chart chart I want food that chat because I want to follow the food that chat at want to be sleeve any idea how to get the food chart,3
5537,women.workout.female.fitness,Usful app üòÅüòÅüòÅ,3
5538,women.workout.female.fitness,Better,3
5539,women.workout.female.fitness,I like the app I hope that it will be a great help for me to get fit body,3
5540,women.workout.female.fitness,It's a good app. You can feel the difference in 2 days but too much add. After first time ubhave to watch adds to unlock 2 day or 3 day challenges.,3
5541,women.workout.female.fitness,Really helpful,3
5542,women.workout.female.fitness,"Good app,but when I finished the first 4 weeks,had to go back and to start from beginning.why there is no option to continue?",3
5543,women.workout.female.fitness,Good,3
5544,women.workout.female.fitness,Sex,3
5545,women.workout.female.fitness,I don't know about the app but is very useful I used to do the every time they is helping to weight loss and there is so interested to do the exercise in our home,3
5546,women.workout.female.fitness,"I mean, so far so good.. I really like the set up. I like the exercises. I just started so I'll rate more when I see results. Its only been 2 days this far.",3
5547,women.workout.female.fitness,"Initially, i thought this app was awesome because of the variety of exercises to target different areas. However, after entering week 2 watching vjdeos does not unlock new exercises, so they are forcing you to purchase access I assume. So i uninstalled it and will look for another app.",3
5548,women.workout.female.fitness,Most of them are lockedddd!!!,3
5549,women.workout.female.fitness,Hii please reply me in return Actually i m 12 years old and i dont want really hard exercise which will effect my hieght and all that so is it okay if i will do these exercises?

5550,women.workout.female.fitness,Which time is best for all these exercises for weight lose?????,3
5551,women.workout.female.fitness,I loved the app but the only problem was that the diet plan which is shown in the pictures was not in the appüòî,3
5552,women.workout.female.fitness,I love this app.I counted the days that i exercise with this app within 7 days you see improve on your body fitness.,3
5553,women.workout.female.fitness,Good app but i want to ask why i don't have the diets also it didn't asked me what's my goal in loosing weight that the upp promises,3
5554,women.workout.female.fitness,This app is good app. It helped me to reduce weight but need to add exercise for breast reduction,3

5559,women.workout.female.fitness,it would be nice to do it with out downloading it but other than that it was fine,3
5560,women.workout.female.fitness,Good app. Don't care for the 30 second videos that pop up befoe workout,3
5561,women.workout.female.fitness,It's good but I don't think that it's good for kids like me I'm 8 year old girl I Wana get slim I'm hope full it's good for kids ü§óü§óüëë,3
5562,women.workout.female.fitness,"So disappointed, there's no meal plan at all!",3
5563,women.workout.female.fitness,"So far in having this app for the past few weeks, I've enjoyed the variety of workouts and stretches it has to offer. One thing I find difficult is the time durations the workouts say before doing them. As a generally busy person, I have a hard time with this because I never know if I have enough time to do the workouts since the time duration it says on it is definitely inaccurate by at least 10 minutes. Is there a solution to maybe have the character do the workout along side you maybe?",3
5564,women.workout.female.fitness,Its nice,3
5565,women.workout.female.fitness,Very.good,3
5566,women.workout.female.fitness,Good,3

5572,women.workout.female.fitness,Why running warm up had removed in update version? Cause I need it :(,3
5573,women.workout.female.fitness,I am loving this app and i am looking forward to downloading a new and improved one if there is going to be one,3
5574,women.workout.female.fitness,"It okay, needs some back workout",3
5575,women.workout.female.fitness,Need more variety of exercise,3
5576,women.workout.female.fitness,Plz tell me about where is the diet plan option?,3
5577,women.workout.female.fitness,I would really like it if there would be jaw line and height increasing exercises,3
5578,women.workout.female.fitness,"It seems a gd app, haven't tried anything yet, but i will with God Willing. And wish to find some effective exercises to lift breasts pls. Thank u.",3
5579,women.workout.female.fitness,Love the app but it keeps closing and wont work.,3
5580,women.workout.female.fitness,Beautiful life changing experience... flexible friendly exercises,3
5581,women.workout.female.fitness,Nice app but i just wanna say this some of the work outs are not for beginners. Some I really can't do cos I've never tried such before and forcing myself to do them hurts me. I feel serious pains all over I can't do any work outs till I'm pain free. Is that supposed to be?,3
5582,women.workout.female.fitness,It does work but my bowel went into a double I have no clue why...the upper abdominal did the abs..but the lower went opposite. So I stopped,3
5583,women.workout.female.fitness,Frr grry too moe mo,3
5584,women.workout.female.fitness,It's the best and it guides you through your workout plus you have some seconds to rest,3
5585,women.workout.female.fitness,2nd day ... with this app hopefully I get the best result.,3
5586,women.workout.female.fitness,It's a really nice and helpfull app I just wish we could add own exercises in it,3
5587,women.workout.female.fitness,It's a good app but where is the diet plan as per the ad,3
5588,women.workout.female.fitness,Can these exercises help to gain weight?! Or it will decrease more??!,3
5589,women.workout.female.fitness,The routines in this app feel like decent workouts and I can feel more/ different muscles being worked. The only reason I gave 3 stars instead of 5 is because I feel like the calories burned seem way too high for the amount of time. I've been doing boxing for months (one of the highest calorie burning exercises) and only burn about 400 calories in 45 min going all out. This app says I'm burning that in 20 minutes and I barely break a sweat. I just doubt the accuracy of the calorie estimate.,3
5590,women.workout.female.fitness,I wanted to reduce my calves but it doesn't had the calves workout...so cringy,3
5591,women.workout.female.fitness,Nice app I am donig it but it is not intersting only same exersizes everyday please do everyday exercise different like rest day and exercise day and in exercise day you have to give few or more exercise. And my weight is not loosing it going upwards only.üôÑüòíüò§üò†üò°,3
5592,women.workout.female.fitness,Good ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è,3
5593,women.workout.female.fitness,It is fine but the courses have not any warm up exercises. And eventually it get start with hard exercises. This may affect and damage our bodies. Pkease add some warm up moves in the beginning of each day course.,3
5594,women.workout.female.fitness,1 month k bad waps se low se suru ho rha h kuch aisa nh ho sakta kast 20 to 30 jaisa workout continue rhe mera thai hip to acha ho pr pet km nh huaa or jyda hi lag rha h,3
5595,women.workout.female.fitness,This app is very good and helpful üëçüëçüëçüëç,3
5596,women.workout.female.fitness,cool,3
5597,women.workout.female.fitness,It works out now my bum is big,3
5598,women.workout.female.fitness,Is nice fast but to slow,3
5599,women.workout.female.fitness,This app is not very bad ‚ò∫... good ..,3
5600,women.workout.female.fitness,"Great workout app! I especially like the stretch routine to relieve neck tension and pain. Sure it has ads, but that's how quality apps can provide their content for free (grow up people). The ads never interrupt a workout and only take a few seconds to watch. I wish there were more workout routines focused on excercising for health instead of losing weight or getting a perfectly toned body. But it's pretty great for a free app.",4
5601,women.workout.female.fitness,"How do I remove ads? I like the app, it provides beginners and advanced options. I'm doing a combination of the 28 day plan and stretching. If you miss one day it faults you by not giving you a reminder. Honestly there's two ads one when you open the app and again when you complete a workout. I just prefer to not have it. Outside of that AMAZING workout especially for beginner like myself.",4
5602,women.workout.female.fitness,"The workouts are a little limited in choices, but it covers all the areas I want to hit as well as in a shorter span of time than other workouts I've done (20 min or less versus minimum of 35min). The workouts are simple overall, and I definitely feel they work. Only negative I've found is that the notifications do not work when the app is closed. I dont get push notifications üòï.",4
5603,women.workout.female.fitness,"Despite the fact that it looks like some generic workout app, it gets the job done pretty well. Using this app I've managed to get visible abs after using it for some time. It has a couple ads but to a reasonable degree seeing that it's a free app. My one critique is that it doesn't include options to mention any past injuries such as a dislocation in order for it to filter out some exercises. I tried out the splits training once but had to stop midway through since it was messing with my knee",4
5604,women.workout.female.fitness,The workouts are good but you have to watch ads to unlock most of them. Not gunna pay for the no ads version but there are so many ads in the free version and at inconvenient times it's annoying besides that it's an overall great app. Good workouts. I love the 30 day challenges and that you can customize the workout if you don't like or can't do some of them.,4
5605,women.workout.female.fitness,"I wish we could save our favorite workouts and have them listed, rather than having to scroll through the long list of workouts each time. Overall, the app is amazing and the workouts are easy to follow with the visual demonstrations. I like that they put time to rest in between and the choice to skip it. Workouts are also divided by difficulty level which is really helpful.",4
5606,women.workout.female.fitness,I really like the app. It's step by step with a demo of how to do the workout. The only downside is that there are maybe 15 different workouts. Would like to see more including strength/weight training. Also the estimated time is way off. I skip the breaks most of the time and it is always at least double the time it says to get through the workout. I'm definitely not going slow either.,4
5607,women.workout.female.fitness,"This is a very useful app! I've used this in combination with a calorie counter app, and I've lost 5 pounds in my first week! I mainly downloaded it so that I could get back into shape, along with healthier eating habits, and I've loved the quick workouts. They can be chosen based on your skill level, and even the Beginner exercises can feel like a challenge (when you're out of shape)!",4
5608,women.workout.female.fitness,I love this app. It has short and sweet workouts so I'm always motivated to exercise knowing it'll only take 10-15 minutes AND I feel the burn every time so I know the workouts are targeted to burn more calories in a shorter amount of time. It's perfect for what I need. 4 stars instead of 5 because it needs more variations in the workouts and stretches. I'd love a few more stretches at the end of the total body workouts. And it could add a calorie counter feature or something similar.,4
5609,women.workout.female.fitness,"It's a really great app, works for my lifestyle and level of fitness, having short periods of free time and being a beginner. However, it does say I burned 200 calories after not even 10 minutes of stretching just my upper back and neck and shoulders... general rule for my weight and height is 100 calories for every HOUR. I like that you can exchange certain exercises for other exercises, but I wish you could make your own workouts.",4
5610,women.workout.female.fitness,"I can have a hard time with timing in my workouts alone, so it's helpful having a voice guide telling me how long to do the exercises and when/for how long to rest. The workouts are pretty effective. I've noticed a difference in strength and flexibility with all of them. The only issues I have are with the fact that they have workouts for targeted fat loss (a hollow promise because medical consensus is that's a myth) and the ads are timed annoyingly. Overall though, I recommend it.",4
5611,women.workout.female.fitness,"I'm enjoying this app pretty well. I like that there are workouts with different levels of difficulty and no ads; it's really cool that I have the option to edit the exercises for these ones! Some of the pre-programed exercises are too hard on my knees so it's really nice that I can swap them out for other activities! For the 7 minute circuits and stretches, I like that these are also available despite the ads they come with. I use the neck, lower back, and sleepy time stretch every day!",4
5612,women.workout.female.fitness,"This review will be based on my first time experience with this app : I truly enjoy the app and all the workouts it has to offer for a beginner like myself. The only thing I notice is that it offers a feature to sync everything to Google Fit but it doesn't have the option to ""Back Up and Restore"". I have the app downloaded onto my HP laptop but when i downloaded to my phone, I had to restart the whole process again. Anyway this can be updated in the future?",4
5613,women.workout.female.fitness,"Great app! I appreciate that it lets you edit the workouts a bit incase you have physical limitations or downstairs neighbors that don't want to hear you do jumping jacks. I do wish there was an option to pay to remove ads. This would be worth the pay. I also wish that we had different music options. All in all though, I like it a lot and am very grateful for it!",4
5614,women.workout.female.fitness,"A convenient app for exercising, I don't have to count the numbers while working out and every workouts set up clearly! Yet I kinda need a workout for my fat calf and some other parts of body, but I like the entire body workout, it's clear and great! And I can't find a place to connect my gmail or sync other apps except google fit which I don't use. On the other hand, the calories we consumed in these workouts are always more than I thought but Idk if it's right or it's eexaggerated.",4
5615,women.workout.female.fitness,"Great fitness app, what sucks though is that you can't run a music app like spotty with it so you can exercise to the music you want to hear. Other than that, it's a great app overall, you get to edit the exercises you want to do and how many reps, etc. I really like it, my kids like it, though we haven't used this app in over a month due to health issues, we will get into the habit of doing so again.",4
5616,women.workout.female.fitness,"I really enjoy this app. I count my calories along with it, but I have lost 11 lbs in two weeks with the full body month challenge. The workouts take very little time, usually 15 mins max. There are ads, but I don't have issues with it interfering with my workouts. You can also set yourself a reminder everyday to make sure you've done them. Give it a try!",4
5617,women.workout.female.fitness,"My experience has been great so far, but I would recommend adding more options of workouts and exercises, also being able to set an alarm that I can label, and I wish that I was able to change the first few questions it asks you when you first get the app, into settings, that way I can keep my progress and do not have to start all over to focus on another area or subject.",4
5618,women.workout.female.fitness,"Great app! I do enjoy this app a lot! I love the progressive workouts to help you work your way to those more advanced workouts. I also enjoy that it tracks the fitness and calories when you do each work out but the downfall is that it doesn't give the option to sync to the big fitness apps just Google, i wish it did since i have a Samsung and it would be nice to sync it on there as well that's why the four star but it is a great fitness app that I use everyday!",4
5619,women.workout.female.fitness,"Although I really enjoy this app, it's been causing off-app ads all the time. Like when i'm watching videos, texting, browsing social media, and even when I just turn my phone on. I know it's from this app because all the other ads from other apps don't look like the ones from this one. I hope this can be foxed so I can give you the 5 stars this app deserves",4
5620,women.workout.female.fitness,"it's a good app and keeps me coming back for my workouts, the 2 things I don't like or are confusing is I never know which workout I should pick as it kinda runs together. my previous workouts and the workouts that I can pick. you have to know the app to know what you're going for next. which in and of itself is fine but still kinda annoying if you're not a computer/app savvy person. the other gripe is when I lay my phone somewhere to run through the workouts, I get confused on which is the start",4
5621,women.workout.female.fitness,"It's fine. I like it, I use it, I add reps and weights to make it better. The calorie count is way off. What I don't understand is that each type of workout says something a number. For example, thigh advanced says ""21 minutes - 29 workouts."" I've never seen more than one workout for any but the full body challenge, so what does that mean? How do you get the other workouts? I only use this for some variety with structure since there's no variation in-app. Also, why is there just one arm workout?",4
5622,women.workout.female.fitness,"This has some great routines for at-home exercise, especially when you have NO equipment to aid you. The main flaw I see is that the 'calories burned' function is GROSSLY overestimated, which is suuuuper dangerous when trying to lose weight (if thats your goal). If you are counting calories, beware because theres NO way I burned that many calories on a stretching exercise! Also, there is no way to disable the viewing of this defunct calorie counter. Otherwise pretty decen app.",4
5623,women.workout.female.fitness,I enjoy the app. It makes it easy to do a quick workout on days I dont feel like planning one or I don't have a partner. However I give it 4 out of 5 because I want more options. Even the advanced workouts seem a little too easy some days. Something more intense is desirable after a long crappy day.,4
5624,women.workout.female.fitness,"Very nice, easy to use, & customizable. Only complaint are the ads (free version-comes w/ the territory). Only request is I would like the workouts to calculate in the rest time in the actual time. I've noticed the time is doubled. For instance, the morning warm-up says it takes 4mins, but it actually took almost 8mins because of the rest periods in between each workout. I need to know the exact time considering I'm a busy mom & need to know how much time I have. Please update for a 5‚òÜ rating.",4
5625,women.workout.female.fitness,"Great workouts saw results quickly. Id give it 5 if they had even more workouts, and a core workout and or back exercises. Overall a great app easy to use quick to pick a work out and complete. I love you can just hit done when you've completed an exercise or next to skip a rest session if you don't need the rest. I've always been fit and love exercise and can do some pretty tough ones as I was a gymnast all growing up, till college. And was certified as a personal trainer at one time.",4
5626,women.workout.female.fitness,This app is fine maybe even perfect but the only problem I have is with the calendar you can't put in days that you actually did workout on the calendar without having to do a routine on the app. For example sometimes I'll watch Chloe Ting exercise videos instead of doing a routine on the app so I should be able to mark the day I did exercise without doing just a routine on the app.,4
5627,women.workout.female.fitness,"I like it. Good for getting started. Lots of videos to demonstrate in case you don't know how to do something. It says there are recipes but I haven't found them. Only complaint in that there are too many pay walls. I already paid to get rid of the obnoxious commercials, and now there is another pay wall for additional exercises. I think if you paid once that should be enough.",4
5628,women.workout.female.fitness,This app is an very useful app! This app has challenges and sessions on specific topics already so I don't have to find them on YouTube or Google. This app even has animation and videos that help so much to understand the excercise. And lastly the reason I gave 4 stars is that they have locked some important excercises for the premium version of this app. You could at least change it to giving extra excercises which are not even seen on the free version of the app. But the app is the best ...! ‚ú®,4
5629,women.workout.female.fitness,Great workouts curated for all your needs. It is easy to follow and creates the discipline you needed.,4
5630,women.workout.female.fitness,"Most of the workouts are directed to female insecurities but if you ignore that, it's a great app.",4
5631,women.workout.female.fitness,I love this app so much. Very lovely exercises for everyone. There very effective and if you put in the time you will see the difference. Very good for a starter and pro app,4
5632,women.workout.female.fitness,The app is good it's gives u morale to continue with the exercise I'm on day7 of my exercise and I feel like I hv lost a lot of weight,4
5633,women.workout.female.fitness,"All good except that it does not sync with Google fit like the other apps from the same company. Also it would be useful if there would be an option to customise the 7x4 challenge so that aftet the first time is completed we can stick with the same structure by changing the number of exercises. Adding a new category with weights or resistence bands would be awesome. Overall great selection of workouts, love the challenge part, great for beginners especially in times like these.",4
5634,women.workout.female.fitness,"I took one starüåü off because the calorie counting seems inaccurate. I did a 6 minute session (the ""sleepy time stretches"") and it said I burnt 160 calories. How is it possible to burn that many calories in 6 minutes through some simple stretching? Besides that, I love this app so far. Lots of different workouts, including quick little animation tutorials AND actual video tutorials. The app looks very clean, organized and beautiful. There's a tracker and chart to show how often you've worked out and how much calories you've burnt. Good stuff üëçüëçüëç, minus the calorie trackerüíî.",4
5635,women.workout.female.fitness,"I enjoy the exercises, the range of options and the variety each day. It would be nice if there was an option to change some of the exercises, or an alternate provided. For example, i cannot complete the 'Leg raises' exercises due to a curve in my spine - i find it very painful. So if there was a seperate option provided that worked the same area, that would be easier to complete, that would be very helpful.",4
5636,women.workout.female.fitness,"This is my second week using it, and I find it a good app. I had a lot of fun the first time because the music was really uplifting and welcome. I'm completely new to this so it made it feel less awkward. Same with the voice coach. Translation could use some work, but it was ok. Haven't tried the abs workout, but the thighs/butt ones could use some exercises for stretching the hamstrings (for everyone who sits a lot). Ads aren't annoying either, it's a free app so I understand the need for them.",4
5637,women.workout.female.fitness,"I love this app! Easy to set up, easy use, easy to follow the workout routine and it has clear instructions and pictures. You can also track your weight and set reminders for workouts and for drinking water. The only reason I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars is because of annoying ads! Even when you first open the app, an ad for liposuction pops up! Ads also pop up during workouts which can be a little distracting! Other than that, this app is epic!",4
5638,women.workout.female.fitness,"I like this app! It's easy to use and a great way to keep on top of your exercise when you can't get to the gym. However, one criticism for me is it focuses too much on body image & weight. I understand a lot of people take up exercise to lose weight, however, it asks you your goal when you first install it and even if you select maintain fitness (for me its actually MH wellbeing) it still asks you to select ""problem' areas, like bum, tum, etc. Not a healthy focus IMO, esp for young women",4
5639,women.workout.female.fitness,"Love this app! I am currently working on the ""Full Body 7√ó4 Challenge"" and it's doing great at motivating me to workout consistently. The progress tracking for weight and BMI is very convenient. Having a visual representation of my progress is very satisfying and it also motivates me to continue working out. I didn't give the app 5 stars due to the lack of variety of arm workouts. Overall, a great fitness app. Highly recommend downloading!",4
5640,women.workout.female.fitness,"It will be nice if you can add more varying workouts and new moves in every update.. I'm buying the free pass and I lready feel kinda bored with the repetitive moves in the workout plans.. Plus, the coach's voice is too low. even though I've turn up the volume, I barely hear it when I'm playing some upbeat song to accompany my workouts.. But, I like this app because I can adjust how many moves or seconds I wanna add on my workout sessions. That way, I can get a good amount of sweats..",4
5641,women.workout.female.fitness,"I really like this training app, for a beginner like me a lot of the other apps have workouts that are quite intense, but this one incorporates rest time in between to recover which is fantastic and you really feel like you've achieved something when you finish the full workout. The only reason that I took a star off is that I can't seem to be able to play my own workout music at the same time as the app which is a little bit disappointing, but otherwise it's fantastic!",4
5642,women.workout.female.fitness,"I haven't been using it for long, I am hoping to get my body back after I had surgery. I really like all the workouts and the fact you can choose to have voiced or muted, each of the exercises are explained. I am not convinced on the calorie expenditure though, I would love it to be true, but for each short workouts, even if they are a bit tough, I don't think they burn that much on the starter level. I have your other apps and if you can explain the calorie issue with me I will give 5* to all",4
5643,women.workout.female.fitness,This app is really good and suggests some of the best exercises for workout. The only problem being the advertisements which are at times a problem and a hindrance to the process. Other than this it is an amazing app since it doesn't charge anything like most of the other apps but is still good. For me the best part being the voice control which instructs as well as the time calculation which is very important for any routine workout.,4
5644,women.workout.female.fitness,"This app is genuinely so great given it is completely FREE. Perfect for at home workouts which are simple and dont require extra equipment. I like that you can swap out certain exercises, helps customise workouts. The variety between choosing from beginner to advanced workouts is great even if super repetitive but the guidance is good enough for me. Only critique is the calorie information is extremely exaggerated so ignore that. Could also do with more arm workouts, as there is only one option.",4
5645,women.workout.female.fitness,"I love this app, and a few weeks ago I would have given it 5 stars, but they changed the voice to a slow speaking woman and although it would be a great voice for mediations, it's rubbish for exercises! I preferred the old voice, even with a few wrongly pronounced words or hiccups in there. EDIT: I managed to change the speech settings after feedback and will give that a go.",4
5646,women.workout.female.fitness,"I've used this app before, I struggle with motivation etc but being able to choose to do three or four days rather than every day is great! I like how simple it is to see the moves but maybe there could be a change avatar bit to make it feel like it's a mini you? Also, the photos above don't match. I way prefer how the app is now but I can't find the diet plan area? I'd love to see what ideas you guys have for meals! ^u^",4
5647,women.workout.female.fitness,"Very nice app . I was never regular in exercise before that and also I never knew where to start . Thanks to this app now I am regular at exercise . Because it show a notification on phone ,that makes me to do it",4
5648,women.workout.female.fitness,This is a great app and it motivates me to exercise and be healthy I am feeling better and I can see a fast change in my body. The app has tons of exercises to choose from and shows how many calories you have lost. I do think they need to add an option for drinking water and staying hidrated but otherwise I'm very happy. There's not a lot of adds so I'm happy with that too overall great app keep up the good worküß° the only thing I'm not happy about is that there's no diet plan..,4
5649,women.workout.female.fitness,Only been using the app for 3 days and so far enjoying the 4/7 workouts. App is very easy to use and looking forward to getting fit and getting rid of some weight!! The only thing I would like to see is alternative exercises if you can't do some of them because of illness or injury. I have had a lot of surgery on my stomach and can't do all of the exercises so an alternative would be great.,4
5650,women.workout.female.fitness,I really liked this app best app but the most important thing I learned is to keep calm while workouting then only you will see results so enjoy go for this build healthy body inorder to get healthy life,4
5651,women.workout.female.fitness,Great and easy to use just the setup is Too long requires information one doesn't know,4
5652,women.workout.female.fitness,"Easy to navigate and really helpful. My therapist suggest me to do some exercise to accompany their treatments for my waist pain, and this app helps a lot. Maybe the only thing I don't like from this app is the excessive ads, it hammers you from the first time you open it. Maybe the devs can look for another way so they still can display some ads and the user still can exercise without feeling annoyed of those ads.",4
5653,women.workout.female.fitness,the exercises were easy I'm trying to get my dream üò¥üí≠ body and I hope this app helps me,4
5654,women.workout.female.fitness,"I'd have given the app 5 stars if it gave us the option to add exercises to the plans instead of just switching them out with another exercise. Other than that, I have no complaints about the app and it has really helped me build a routine for daily workouts. I highly recommend it for those who want apps that give good plans and guidance for their workouts. The exercises are also well-suited to the levels. I would recommend for the app to give users variations/suggestions for the exercises.",4
5655,women.workout.female.fitness,I like the intensity of the workout for beginners.,4
5656,women.workout.female.fitness,I did first 28 days and there is visible change and overall good feeling of myself right now..Thank You.,4
5657,women.workout.female.fitness,I really like it. It gets you fit but it takes a 3-4 weeks . It's not really a long process .,4
5658,women.workout.female.fitness,It is very good but the are to much ads to do some workout,4
5659,women.workout.female.fitness,"Great app, I'm not loosing weight but definitely feeling more firm after only a week, 10 minutes is really good too as I'm a busy mum. Some exercises are too challenging for my back and knees so an option to do a different exercise could be helpful. The payment to remove the ads and video was cheap too, and once off, no monthly fee so really appreciate this too.",4
5660,women.workout.female.fitness,"I paid for the app about a year ago before premium, and now it's telling me I have to pay $48 for a year or $8 a month for premium, so paying twice :( I paid for the app the first year to get rid of ads and unlock exercises and now I have to pay for a premium subscription to access workouts again. Love the app tho, good for those working their way back into fitness, but paying again after I paid a year ago before makes me sad.",4
5661,women.workout.female.fitness,Undoubtedly one of the best workout app out there. Exercise are very specific oriented based on your level of workout. And it does help you to achieve your goals. Simply fantastic app ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê,4
5662,women.workout.female.fitness,It is the best fitness app i've ever had. I like all this diffrent exercises and in diffrent levels too. Every second day me and my sister do an 7x4 full body challenge and usually we do some more workouts or streaches. I like that there is also face exercise. It great but there is something i don't like ads. You must watch it if you want to unlock the workaut. Please fix that and it will be really great.,4
5663,women.workout.female.fitness,"I love this app as the exercises are quite well explained and there is enough choice, especially fond of the full body challenge, which has a nice build-up. However, I miss the breathing advice this app used to have (breathe in when ..., breathe out when...), it really helped me manage the exercises even better!",4
5664,women.workout.female.fitness,"I do the full body workout and rn still in progress, it's 12 days left, and I really happy to see the improvement that showed by my strengths. Like, I can do plank longer and also push up not so hard anymore to do it, the leg-raises exercise is pretty hard, but then I get used to it. I'm so happy. But the reason I gave 4 stars, since the adv sometimes annoying af.thankss",4
5665,women.workout.female.fitness,The workouts are actully really good. Some workouts ask you to watch a video to unlock it first which can be a pain but it's worth it. It's really helpful with helping me keep track of how much weight I've lost and how many caleries I burn during workouts. I'm a really lazy person and this app actually worked really well. The 4 stars is only because I wish it had some more stretches that burned more then 60 caleries. But other then that it's really good.,4
5666,women.workout.female.fitness,"It is good because you can exercise without equipment. The reason why I gave it a four star because there's a photo that you can choose to focus during exercise but when I downloaded the app there's no chest in the chooses. Its only a thigh, arm, belly, butt and leg and I have a small chest so I want to improve it by exercising. Sorry for my bad english, I hope that their some exercises for chest in your app.",4
5667,women.workout.female.fitness,"I LOVE this app and originally gave it 5 stars but I am rewriting my review giving it 4 stars. I have completed the 28 day challenge twice now and can't find an option to continue without restarting my progress. I don't want to restart it as it sets me back to the beginning. Can anyone tell me if I'm missing something? If not, the developer should have an option to continue from where the user finished. I would be willing to pay a fee for it.",4
5668,women.workout.female.fitness,"Very good app. Its very handy and has lots of excersing options for different levels and parts of your body. The only thing that could make it better is having an option to pay a few pounds and get rid of the ads, as I would pay that, as its a very good app and it supports the owners too!",4
5669,women.workout.female.fitness,"Thanks! Very good excercises and easy to make a routine. When I accidentally cleared my apps after ending a call, it didn't save my progress so that I could continue from where I left off. That brought down my motivation and annoyed me. It does, however, save how long you had excercised. Also, I cant sync to my Samsung Health app (only Google Fit). A wider variety of system health app compatibility would be appreciated. Lastly, please no pop up ads. The ones above the workout interface are fine.",4
5670,women.workout.female.fitness,"I really enjoy this app, the commercials/ads are limited to after my particular exercises that I choose. The rest exercises that I've tried just need to be watched an ad before hand. But hey, it keeps the app free for us poor peeps, so I don't mind. I can also mute the app to listen to my spotify music. So bonus points. üòä",4
5671,women.workout.female.fitness,"Really effective. I have actually seen results. There is only one advice I would like to give to the creators - there should be an option to sync our progress, may be with an ID or Gmail account. I lost my phone and I installed the app on my new phone and my progress was 0. I had to start from scratch. It creates problem specifically in 7*4 challenge category.",4
5672,women.workout.female.fitness,It's a nice app for girls or teenager like me. I got good result in one week it takes time to lose weight but I lost 1kg each week and its definitely a good app for beginners like me The thing is I gave 4 stars because we can't save our workouts and that was the thing I needed and even we can't delete the workout which we don't want else it's a nice app for workout I would recommend you to download it .but I want that option to save or delete our workout.,4
5673,women.workout.female.fitness,"Very amazing app for women to help them keep their body in shape. But the ads are quite annoying but bcs the app is free so ig its adjustable. Other than that I'd like you to add a dark theme, option to create our own playlist of diffrent workouts and also the exercises like push-ups for beginners. I think that'd really help. Overall it's wonderful. Keep it up developers!!!",4
5674,women.workout.female.fitness,"I love almost everything about this app, it gives you all kinds of workout and you can even work a particular area of focus, if you don't understand a workout u can watch the videos, it also includes facial exercises which was you will not find in any such apps. But you can add a warm up section in this too, for us to do before starting the workout.",4
5675,women.workout.female.fitness,"Fantastic app, easy to follow, increases in time and challenge by few minutes, so to slowly build up excersize to gain results, tells you how many calories you have burnt and you can what days you wish to excersize with reminder, motivational and fun and excersizes are also varied, only thing I would change is that their should be an option to change or add background music x",4
5676,women.workout.female.fitness,I do enjoy this app. The core of the app is free to use. It is also offline usable so that makes my life easier (i dont have internet at home). My only problem is that i watched the ads to unlock the routines. Once i went home (and therefore offline) it told me i had to watch ads to unlock it. If this gets fixed then this app deserves 5/5 stars and i can only hope more is added to this app in the future!,4
5677,women.workout.female.fitness,I've just started using it. As a beginner it really helps me to take count of what I'm doing exactly. Breathing and keeping track of count seems difficult for me. The only thing I felt is if it had exercise for busts too. And some motivational quotes. :) Will update my results! One star taken for wrong calories. I'm not sure if its correct and I think instead of total time of exercise done it should show the time taken each day.,4
5678,women.workout.female.fitness,I loved it and doing everyday.. It became my routine to do this workouts. Without any fitness knowledge I opened this app. With the help of videos I did every step now it's getting easy and more effective.. Thanks for this App.. But one thing that I'm irritating was that irrelevant ads.. Some pics in ad was very bad..pls do something to hide,4
5679,women.workout.female.fitness,Super easy to follow along.,4
5680,women.workout.female.fitness,"This app was basically what I was looking for...it has a simple, no frills interface, has minimal ads, and the 28 day increases the intensity of the full body workouts. The reason I gave it four stars is that I wish the 28 day challenge had the option of continuing to keep increasing reps and introducing new exercises instead of resetting to the beginning.",4
5681,women.workout.female.fitness,I like it the only problem I have is that it does the same exercises like 3 times,4
5682,women.workout.female.fitness,some work outs aren't free but there is good ones too,4
5683,women.workout.female.fitness,I just downloaded this app tonight. I did my first workout with this app just a little bit ago and after my 20 minute workout it said I burned 497 calories. I'm a bit skeptical in the accuracy. If it's right then yay but it just seems highly unlikely for someone my weight to burn that many calories in that short of a time period. I Definitely like the app it's just disappointing that the accuracy seems to be a bit off.,4
5684,women.workout.female.fitness,"Well, it's a wonderfully made app with lots of useful exercises. However, there is one major thing essentially completely barring me from using it. The only place I have any opportunity to exercise is in my bedroom, where the noise from even walking gets me shouted at. If there were exercises without jumping, this app would be perfect. Otherwise, I'm afraid it must be uninstalled. Really a shame, lovely app.",4
5685,women.workout.female.fitness,"Really enjoying the app so far - has kept me consistent for 3 weeks and feel way more motivated to work out! Only giving it a 4 star because the music is getting so repetitive, it's actually driving me slowly crazy. If there were a few different music choices to choose from it would be a 5 star for sure!",4
5686,women.workout.female.fitness,"I really enjoy this app. I wish there was a way to save progress though, without syncing to Google Fitbit (which I don't have). I've been having issues with my phone and it's needed repair twice, then all the progress is gone :(",4
5687,women.workout.female.fitness,Overall a very amazing app for improving ur fitness. There r lots of routines to choose from and u can choose which areas u wanna focus each day. My only issue is with the fact that it doesn't count the calories burned accurately. The no. of calories burned by each regime keeps decreasing each time u repeat it...which feels kinda demotivating.,4
5688,women.workout.female.fitness,"I love this app it helps when I am not feeling creative at the gym and I can workout everywhere. The only thing is that I would like to be able to listen to my Spotify while using the app. Also the ""watch the video to unlock"" doesn't work.",4
5689,women.workout.female.fitness,"I love this app, it has certainly helped me increase my fitness. It has a good selection of workouts and all suitable to do if you don't have a lot of time. One improvement would be to have a screen to allow the user to enter time or distance spent running as the report function doesn't take this into account, it only takes into account the pre-run warm up and cool down.",4
5690,women.workout.female.fitness,"Brilliant! It has different levels, so you can do however much you want no matter how experienced you are in exercising. There are plenty of smaller exercises, such as face slimming and ""Sleepy-Time Stretch"". Highly recommended, however there are a whole lot of ads.",4
5691,women.workout.female.fitness,I honestly wish some of them were harder. I used to do things far more intense and jumping back into working out was very easy with this app. It's good if you aren't as used to working out but I do wish it did more far intense workouts or more challenges.,4
5692,women.workout.female.fitness,"The app is nice. 4 stars are because the calendar starts from Sunday, even though I set it to start from Monday... And also ads are quite invasive. When they exercise is on, the ad is occupying almost the entire screen and the exercise itself is super small.",4
5693,women.workout.female.fitness,"Amazing app, helps me find some motivation to not give up too early in the given routine when I start exercising, and it's great that with it I can exercise at home, as I'm not a fan of doing that stuff in public. Only missing the possibility to build my own routines from the exercises they have (which is something possible in the stretching exercises app)",4
5694,women.workout.female.fitness,Its a good app for a general guide on exercise. However I wish that it had an option to track weekly progress with friends or compete with friends and their exercise routine. Also wished that I could manually add some exercise like I would do some crunches but can't add it here.,4
5695,women.workout.female.fitness,"Just what I needed definitely appreciate the music in the background and the motivating prompts. love the video examples that show how to do the exercises effectively. I can literally feel myself stronger and I like that you can adjust the rest times. love this! after struggling with excessive weight gain due to preeclampsia, I had absolutely no muscle tone and everything hurt. this helped my core so much and strengthening. I pair these workouts with daily cardio (stationary bike, running). than",4
5696,women.workout.female.fitness,Ads are at the start and end of the workout and doesn't interrupt with the workout. But now my focus is on full body workout to improve overall fitness and this app only contains workouts that target specific areas of your body so I gonna jump to other fitness apps. This app is simple and good if you want to tone specific areas.,4
5697,women.workout.female.fitness,"it's good, i like it. i like the various kind of workouts, i loss my weight yeyy! . but i have suggest to add the water tracker, like the previous app. and then the minus is to little instructions from the guide, example like how to breaths correctly, the right things must do when we do the exercises. thank you : )",4
5698,women.workout.female.fitness,"Great app allows you to customize your workouts. Change the # of reps or sub one out for another! This way you can focus on different areas each time. Also like the way they don't do the count off for you, move at your own pace. Main reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the limited # of exercises they make available on the full body. The individual workouts have a great variety, should make these available on the full body workout too. Also need more /better upper body / arms exercises",4
5699,women.workout.female.fitness,"I like it. The programs are good, training doesn't feel hard, but judging by the muscle aches next day it works! Just the kind of training i have been looking for. I wish however I could pause the training sometimes (if i need to get something from another room etc), haven't found that function there.",4

5743,women.workout.female.fitness,I like it the only problem I have is that it does the same exercises like 3 times,4
5744,women.workout.female.fitness,This app is an very useful app! This app has challenges and sessions on specific topics already so I don't have to find them on YouTube or Google. This app even has animation and videos that help so much to understand the excercise. And lastly the reason I gave 4 stars is that they have locked some important excercises for the premium version of this app. You could at least change it to giving extra excercises which are not even seen on the free version of the app. But the app is the best ...! ‚ú®,4
5745,women.workout.female.fitness,I love it,4

Sure it has ads, but that's how quality apps can provide their content for free (grow up people). The ads never interrupt a workout and only take a few seconds to watch.

5794,women.workout.female.fitness,"Very nice app . I was never regular in exercise before that and also I never knew where to start . Thanks to this app now I am regular at exercise . Because it show a notification on phone ,that makes me to do it",4
5795,women.workout.female.fitness,I love this app so much. Very lovely exercises for everyone. There very effective and if you put in the time you will see the difference. Very good for a starter and pro app,4
5796,women.workout.female.fitness,Fabulous,4
5797,women.workout.female.fitness,"I paid for the app about a year ago before premium, and now it's telling me I have to pay $48 for a year or $8 a month for premium, so paying twice :( I paid for the app the first year to get rid of ads and unlock exercises and now I have to pay for a premium subscription to access workouts again. Love the app tho, good for those working their way back into fitness, but paying again after I paid a year ago before makes me sad.",4
5798,women.workout.female.fitness,The best workouts üî•,4
5799,women.workout.female.fitness,Its great! Only thing I'd change is letting people add their own music.,4
5800,women.workout.female.fitness,"Great for at home workouts, beginners, or when you just want to stretch. I paid for a premium subscription. I used to pay for the gym, which i never go to, so i thought to myself, ""Why not?"" And i don't regret it. I'm getting my workouts more than when i had the gym subscription. This app is what works for me. I love its simplicity and appreciate the instructions and challenges. The workouts are diverse and target different muscle groups. TLDR: I'm satisfied with the app and its services. üòä",5
5801,women.workout.female.fitness,"Variety of exercises is excellent. Can choose arms, legs, butt, and, face, or full body. Different experience levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced). I dislike the ads before exercises that are specific body sections, which display before and after the routine (every time routine is selected), but this can be changed by paying for app. Overall, I truly like this exercise app and use it daily, doing multiple routines, and feel more flexible and energetic with a more shapely body.",5
5802,women.workout.female.fitness,"As someone who is Athletic and wants to do exercise again after a long while. It is easy to start simple and has more difficult stuff. Excercises make an impact and it is customizable with how long or difficult. Once you do a few of the selections. You can pick the right ones. I do change a few exercises and let the timer run to count it. Ex. Pushups for planks, wall pushups etc. Similar exercises to the ones shown. It helps keep it the same for progress.",5
5803,women.workout.female.fitness,"Incredible app!:) üòç Love the exercises and various key areas of the body you can work on. Since I have used this I keep track of my goals with the handy calender that shows what you did on each day you use it. I've noticed a difference in my physique and enjoy that it announces and shows what exercises you are doing in clear moving animations - even the countdown I find very helpful so you can stay in the zone without looking at the screen! Overall, lovely app. Glad I started using it. ‚ò∫",5
5804,women.workout.female.fitness,"I only recently downloaded this app, but I have found it to be very helpful so far. I am a huge procrastinator, and because of this I usually have a hard time keeping up with self care such as exercising. But it has been very easy so far. The ads are fairly short, and only occur to unlock an exercise, and at the end of the workout. The app has a lot of diversity, including warm ups, stretches, full body and individual work outs, as well as pain relieving stretches; also keeps track of progress",5
5805,women.workout.female.fitness,"Love this App!! It has all kinds of different excercises that I can do and it makes the gym experience more fun! Now I could get my body right for the summer time!üòÅüëçüèΩ Wish me luck! The only problem is that I can not sync my Spotify music to this app which I wish they can do so I can excercise while listening to my favorite music! Other than that, this app is the bomb!!‚ù§‚ù§üòÅ",5
5806,women.workout.female.fitness,If you are looking for a free easy-to-use and engaging workout app-- you've found it! ‚ö° It's quick to set up and if you like it you can back it up to your Google account as another plus. You can set up a time to be notified to workout and customize rest times between sets of exercises. The exercise variety is amazing! You will feel challenge no matter your experience level. Another great thing is that all the exercises have how-to buttons and no equipment needed. This is the best workout app! üôå,5
5807,women.workout.female.fitness,"Very nice app, only ads I see are when you open the app and after a workout. Many different workout options, including daily challenges. There are some workouts you have to unlock with an ad, but they are very worth it. Something interesting I noticed after a workout is that they give you an ad for a totally different app used for working out. It's like they want you to go somewhere else lol. Very excited to continue using this app in the in the upcoming future.",5
5808,women.workout.female.fitness,"I have used this app for a few months now, haven't had a single issue. Being a free app it has so many features for you to use. the workouts are as hard or easy as you want them to be, they have arm, leg, abs or full body workouts to choose from and different levels! It tracks your calories burned, enter in your info to keep track of weight loss and it sends you a reminder(if you opt to do so) to do your workouts. There are a few ads but never interrupts the workouts and it's only one.",5
5809,women.workout.female.fitness,"Love this app! I've been using it for 8 months now. Such a variety of workouts. Timing is great. Love that it tells me how much calories have been burned at the end. But biggest downfall is there is no sign in page. Sometimes I do workouts on a tablet versus my phone and I have no way to connect the workouts. If I could log in on any tablet, computer, phone. I'm sure it would sync all the workouts and I could keep better track of my activity. Otherwise definitely recommend it üíï",5
5810,women.workout.female.fitness,"Normally I hate working out alone but this app makes it feel as though you're being coached through the exercise. You can select the intensity you want which makes it really easy to build up your strength. If you're more experienced you can also shorten the rest time and if you're less experienced, vise versa. I like how there's a daily workout with a weekly trophy, it really motivates me to be consistent each day. Also, it's free! Most work out apps cost too much. I highly recommend this app!",5
5811,women.workout.female.fitness,"I love the tips during the exercises, the countdown when there are 3 seconds left, the videos for how to properly do the exercises, the option of different levels (i.e. beginner to advanced), the calendar tracking, and more! I actually felt the burn after doing the intermediate arm workout and I have been looking for something like this for awhile.",5
5812,women.workout.female.fitness,"While it does have ads, it's been the best app for getting back into exercises. With warm ups and bed exercises if you need to be lazy. And a voice that tells you when it time to start, halfway through and finished with each exercise. And a graphic showing how to do everything. It's a ""exercise for dummies* sort of app. Highly recommend trying it. Also tracks weight and calories burned in the exercises. (With an option to attach to a Fitbit.)",5
5813,women.workout.female.fitness,"Really enjoy the different levels of workout, and the variety so it gets changed up even when you choose the same type of workout. Very few ads. nice customization, like choosing your down time in between sets. And I like the simple narration when the sound is on, and the visuals. I don't think I'll be trying any other workout apps =)",5
5814,women.workout.female.fitness,"great little app for me!! I needed something I could do anywhere and has stretches included at the end of every workout, pre times and flexible levels like beginners, intermediate and advanced. Also, has a 90 day challenge that's long term. it tracks your workouts and has stretches for waking up and for bedtime. It tracks calories burned AND syncs to google fit. All around great app!!",5
5815,women.workout.female.fitness,"This is the best work out app ever!! Im not over exaggerating!! If you're considering downloading do it!! This app will not let you down, its easy to use, is visually pleasing, isn't just for loosing weight but maintaining or just toning up, tracks your progress but also keeps you motivated, and there's different levels of workouts (which is a beginners dream)! Not only are there work outs for different things (butt abs arms etc) but there's stretches to! Thank you so much!!",5
5816,women.workout.female.fitness,"Best Quick Workout! I love the variety, abd that you can customize or skip the rest and countdown times. It's really easy to watch the gifs of exercises you aren't familiar with. I don't do too many of the workouts, but the two I've tried are great. You get one free a day. The trainings are quick and easy to fit into even a busy day. I wish they had more arm trainings. Overall, for a free app, I'm really pleased. I probably will buy the ad free version and unlock the workouts eventually.",5
5817,women.workout.female.fitness,"This app is amazing. As someone who has always led a very sedentary lifestyle, I could never seem to get into a proper exercise routine. But this app is fun and super easy to follow! One thing that I think would make it even better would be the ability to add notes to your calender every day. That way you can also keep track of other things (i.e. measurements, running distance) without using a different app. That aside, it gets a 5/5 from me.",5
5818,women.workout.female.fitness,"Great App, easy to use. Simple exercises, I really like the warm up and cool down with each workout. I look forward to the stretching at the end the most. One thing to note: it has you put in your height and weight. It has a BMI calculator built into the app. My goal was not to focus on weight but to gain strength. I would rather not make my weight a goal as I want to gain muscle mass. So the BMI chart I dont like. Also it has banner ads for gastric surgery. Still I great user friendly app.",5
5819,women.workout.female.fitness,"Great free app. There are ads. Of course there is, it is a free app. But the reminders you set yourself, on your schedule, are super helpful. Each work out day you choose the area you want to continue on. Each day gets a little more. Each day is a variety of timed exercises with count downs for your convenience. Thanks! This is exactly what I was looking for!",5
5820,women.workout.female.fitness,"I am a big time procrastinater. I have not ever been consistent with my workouts and healthy goals. This app is so far the best thing, I have been looking forward to using it. Average 10 minute workouts, which I can easily find time for. And I feel the right amount of soreness from the various moves. I paid the one time fee to have the ads removed, but really, it was to support the app. Also, since I paid for it, I'm likely to keep it, lol. I'm not using a scale, not yet, but I FEEL good!",5
5821,women.workout.female.fitness,"This is so amazing. All of it is free and there are so many workouts to use. Some of the workout are split up between beginner, intermediate, and advanced. So if you are wanting to work on something specific, you just have to press a button. The ads usually come after you finish a workout and they aren't super long videos they are just pop up ads so I don't find it annoying especially because it is for free.",5
5822,women.workout.female.fitness,"I really like this app for it's simplicity. Usually I enjoy doing a group class or going for a run to workout, but when I'm busy or have limited space, I like to use this to get a quick workout in. The advanced workouts are about 30 min, intermediate 20, and beginner 10 min. Skipping or shortening rest breaks between each exercise you can do it quicker and sweat more. I used this a lot while I was doing quarantine in a hotel room - no excuse to miss a workout!",5
5823,women.workout.female.fitness,"Love this app all, except for one thing. I would really like it if there were less adds, and you can just do workouts with not having to watch an add every time. Also a tip for the creators is I would love it if you could like favorite or save a workout you like. One thing I have loved on this app is how it tracks your calories. But other than that I think it's really helped with losing weight, thanks a lot for making this app ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",5
5824,women.workout.female.fitness,"There are adds but they're really not too bothersome. You can unlock more workouts my watching a 20-30 second add which is not any worse than YouTube, (am I right?). The feeling of completing a workout and getting the little ""you rock!"" at the end, along with the amount of workouts you've done and calories you burned is very gratifying! This has been a real motivator during the quarantine. (Balances out all the baking I've been doing). üí™üèª",5
5825,women.workout.female.fitness,"I'm not a very athletic person by any means. I've been overweight/obese for my entire life and am just recently starting to get in shape. This app is definitely helping with that. It makes it so much easier to figure out what workouts to do. I love that I can switch out workouts too. I workout at night when my family is asleep so I cant do jumping workouts or anything that makes noise, so I just substitute those workouts. It's great!",5
5826,women.workout.female.fitness,"Fun and easy to use. Want to do more? I do rotations 3xs then I hit play so it's on my calendar as done but I did more to meet my needs. Simple and easy to follow, it tells you each step starting with how, then paces with you for the 30 seconds or whatever. You can focus on arms, legs, rotate and so on. I'm excited about this app, check it out!",5
5827,women.workout.female.fitness,"I really like this app. It's convenient and even if I'm unsure of an exercise, the tutorial video with description is very helpful. I was kind of turned off to having to subscribe to move forward on most of the exercises, but it's not bad of a price. If I had to change anything, I think an option to log outside exercises would be even better.",5
5828,women.workout.female.fitness,Best workout app ever! I love the different options and how you have 2 minute to 7 minute workouts for different muscle groups. And you even have different sections to improve flexibility/mobility. The ads are only up to 30 seconds so I appreciate that. I love the workouts to get rid of a double chin and to skim your face. This app is amazing! I just recommended it to a few ladies I met earlier today.,5
5829,women.workout.female.fitness,"this is so great, simple layout, it shows you how many calories and workouts you have accomplished for the week! really motivates me to do more! AND the workouts range from beginner, intermediate, and advanced! so simple. Oh yeah and did i mention its FREE?! Ive had subscriptions to other workout apps that werent half as good as this. amazing app üëåüëèüôå",5
5830,women.workout.female.fitness,"I really love the workouts on this app. I have hypothyroidism, major depressive disorder, and moderate breathing issues, so like 95% of the time I'm awake I am exhausted. Sometimes I have to pick and choose what daily activities to do because certain activities use more energy than others. The exercises on this app are incredibly low energy, but still offer results. I've been doing them for a week and have noticed my arms and butt are already tighter. So thanks for creating this app, yo.",5
5831,women.workout.female.fitness,"Having been a ""gym rat"" for many years and even competing for a time, getting back into a gym after an MS diagnosis is a daunting idea. These apps ( I also have the stretching app, which is an awesome alternative to yoga right now because of balance) are helping me a great deal with form, variety and tracking my progress. Great job!",5
5832,women.workout.female.fitness,This app makes it easy to workout when you need it. I use it during lunch breaks and between gaps in classes at school when I can't get to the gym some days. It has the ability to customize parts of your work out which is great if you have a sore knee that day but still want to get a work out in. I would gladly pay for more features and no adds with this app. Thank you for making working out easier!,5
5833,women.workout.female.fitness,"I love this app, I am a beginner at excersizing and I just wanted to get stronger, and this app does a marvelous job. You can pick the difficulty level for each targeted area, like I'm using the intermediate arm workouts but the begginer abs workouts,its like you can tailor it to yourself and its great. You can also feel your muscles start working,which is something I've never experienced before. Coodos to the makers, this thing is great!",5
5834,women.workout.female.fitness,i really like this app because it tells u your progress and gives u many workout options. I'm 13 and just trying to stay fit over the summer üí™.the only things that i don't like r that some workouts require watching a video before doing a workout. i kinda wish they would make the voice more human like and not so robotic. But im not going to subtract a star just because of those things. In the end it's still a great exercise/workout app!,5
5835,women.workout.female.fitness,"This app is amazing! I really love it! I don't have to go to a gym. It's perfect for introverts like me!!üòú This app is motivating,at least for me! It makes working out easy and even fun! Each day of exercise is a little different from the day before. I like that the app switchs things up so your body is always being challenged. You can pick what area of the body you want to focus on.üí™ You can work on something different every day if you want. I love the options the app gives you! A great find!",5
5836,women.workout.female.fitness,"Great at home app! I have a busy life and evening workouts at a gym just couldn't work for me. I now workout in the morning in our little at home gym and I use this app. I love that it has multiple settings to change specific exercises, some I can't do from past injuries, this allows me to modify. It talks you through your work out, it offers tips and errors to change, and it has a mini video if the exercise, if needed. For any working and busy moms this app is perfect!",5
5837,women.workout.female.fitness,"For someone who used to have access to a full gym, this app does the trick. I've learned new exercises and stretches that leave me just the right amount of sore. I love the different levels of intensity and types of routines modified for different concentrations. The animations are super instructive and if I'm ever confused there's videos and written explanations that demonstrate proper form for best execution. The only thing I call to question is the calorie burn calculations seem overestimated",5
5838,women.workout.female.fitness,Love this app! After ballooning up to the largest I have been....in trying to get in better shape and lose weight. App is challenging for me. (Right now). App is easy to use and is the right duration. Just enough to get my heart rate up with out stressing my body. I do twice a day to keep my metabolism up. And VERY VERY pleased (also counting calories .) Highly recommend for short workouts!!,5
5839,women.workout.female.fitness,"App seems easy to use. Nice, short exercises. Even I can do most of these, I have something üôÑ wrong in each area of my spine-modified corrected chiari malformation at the very top, a herniated disc in my neck, tethered cord at the bottom, & I think a new/recurring syrinx in the middle- in bra strap area. Exercise & I never saw eye to eye, there was a reason I was chosen (close to) last in gym. App even has a reminder to tell you to get off your butt. Sorta wish it had a hot poker, too-I need it",5
5840,women.workout.female.fitness,"loving this fitness app! helps me to set, and achieve my goals with it's structured plans and alarm reminders. I love that I can input my height and weight, and it shows me exactly how far I have to go to get to my ideal fitness level.

5841,women.workout.female.fitness,"That app really teaches you about weight loss, and it actually helps you lose weight. Unlike other apps ive used this one really helps you stay on top of things.

5842,women.workout.female.fitness,"Effective and does the job! I laughed at first, 10 minute workouts, ha! BUT THEY ARE WONDERFUL! The coaching is clear and encouraging. The exercises rotate their focus areas and routines. Enough for me to be a little sore the next day but not hurting so bad I cant move. I can do 10 minutes, break a little sweat, and move on with my day. Glad I find this app!",5
5843,women.workout.female.fitness,"I love this app so far. It gives a bunch of really good exercises and stitches. I already know that I'll be using it just about every day to build my body up and get stronger. Although, in the images for the app, the preview, you have an image showing diet plans and recipes. Although I can't find that in the app. If you removed that feature, maybe you should update the images so people don't be mislead into thinking there are recipes when there aren't. Overall it is a great app.",5
5844,women.workout.female.fitness,"What a great app! Very user friendly and well planned out. Lots of different workouts targeting the areas you want to address. You can choose to do beginner, intermediate or advanced workouts. Shows you how to do each exercise. And the app verbally tells you the next exercise and how many reps. So cool and really well done!",5
5845,women.workout.female.fitness,"Love: *That I can change items in the work out, because some things I just can't do so it's nice to have the ability to tailor it to your needs. (not every option/work out can be changed) *The ""gifs"" are helpful, and the how to videos even more so. Plenty of different methods of explaining :) *Voice isn't annoying *Calendar showing my progress Dislike: *BMI, considering I was even overweight according to BMI when younger (135 lbs 5'7""), I see it as useless. Wish I could just hide it.",5
5846,women.workout.female.fitness,"This app is great! It has beginners, intermediate & advance levels which is a big plus! It's super easy to use & you can track the calories you burned for the week. Love the morning warm up. The exercises are short but very effective! I've been using the app for a little over a week & can already feel the difference",5
5847,women.workout.female.fitness,The workouts themselves are easy to follow and you can change your rest time in between to suit your needs while also being able to skip an exercise or pause anytime you'd like. I've not used those functions yet as I haven't felt I needed to. It keeps a great pace and I feel like I've done a nice workout. I'm not sure how the calories burned add up though. Of you're really working hard it might be correct? I like to do the daily workout and then an another one as well since they're short and sw,5
5848,women.workout.female.fitness,"Major plus to this app is being able to customise the amount of exercises, and being able to pause. I started using this during the beginning of the covid lockdown. I have an enlarged heart, and the doctor says that I should try 30 minutes of exercise a day. Though they probably tell everyone that. Dumb, but this helped me through lockdown, as I was living alone.",5
5849,women.workout.female.fitness,"Has been helping to keep my energy and mood up cause before I spent a lot of days doing absolutely no activity. I like the breaks in between each exercise since my body and heart are out of shape from never spending time to exercise before. I've been doing the full body workout so far because I don't have a certain body part I want to strengthen, I just want to get more fit in general. The exercises have a short animation showing you how to do them which is super helpful!",5
5850,women.workout.female.fitness,"May 24, 2021 I did my first workout today. I absolutely love this app! The app lets you switch workout movements if you can't/don't like the ones they've chosen. You can have the app send a message over Instagram or other apps to anyone notifying that you've worked out. It also connects to Google Fit. The ads are not that bad. Just one at the end of each workout. The app is so easy to use! So far, I would recommend this app. I will update this review at the end of my 28 day challenge.",5
5851,women.workout.female.fitness,i honestly love this app. i downloaded it 2 months ago and ive lost a lot of weight and got rid of my cellulite. of course you have to be dedicated and manage your own dieting with it but none the less this app helped me tone areas ive been trying to tone for a good while now. you can change whatever to fit your excersing needs and challenges. i absolutely love it :),5
5852,women.workout.female.fitness,"Great short workouts! Love that they challenge me for only minutes at a time. No more hours of sweating for me. I love the different workout options and that the app shows what exercises are involved before I even start. Time is limited for me, so these get right to the point and I'm starting to see results after 3 weeks usage, 3 times per week.",5
5853,women.workout.female.fitness,"I absolutely love this app. During the pandemic I started to gain so much weight and felt so bad about myself. It wasn't until a few weeks ago that I decided to change this. Combined with a healthy diet, this app has helped lose around 9 lbs in 3 to 4 weeks. I enjoy the training, the workouts...everything. I personally don't like to exercise much, but I feel pretty motivated to keep doing these workouts everyday, so, thanks for that! Looking forward to keep using this app ‚ô°.",5
5854,women.workout.female.fitness,"Been exploring these apps the last couple days and found them brief but effective work outs. Only critique would be that some of the exercises could use better or more thorough explanations. Some are very easy to get wrong. When in doubt, google works but it would be the height of convenience to have everything one place. Overall, this is a user friendly app with nonintrusive ads and no annoying paywalls. Reccomended for beginners and experienced users.",5
5855,women.workout.female.fitness,"I really like this app. I got sick a few years ago and gained weight over the past few years, now that I'm getting a handle on my anemia and lymes I'm starting to work out again. If I start to blackout (it doesn't happen much) or need a break in the middle of a workout I can pause it until I can continue. The workouts are great and I love that they have a little animation showing how to do them properly. I downloaded this app a few weeks ago and I'm already losing weight. I would recomend it!",5
5856,women.workout.female.fitness,"I absolutely love it. Its convenient keeps track of everything I do, changes up the exercises the more you do. And absolutely FREE! I hate when an app has hidden charges once you download it. This hasn't. The exercises are mainly easy but you definitely feel it!",5
5857,women.workout.female.fitness,"The perfect exercise workout with no equipment and you can take it wherever you go. These plans do all the decision-making for you, so all you have to do is follow along. It allows you to make changes, so very versatile to meet your needs. I like the option of different voices too. This app makes me not dread exercising anymore!",5
5858,women.workout.female.fitness,"Perfect way to stay fit and healthy during lock down, it gives you enough exserises to stay fit, ads a bit annoying, the 7 minute work outs I just have to watch videos and its unlocked. It doesn't do that for everyone tho. The exserises are not to hard and last no longer than 20 minutes actually a lot of them are 15-17 minutes long. The levels go to begginner-Advanced.",5
5859,women.workout.female.fitness,"I love this so much! About 3 months ago, I had a c-section and was told to take it easy. I started using this app about a month later and have definitely seen results. I wish I could post pictures because I'm SO happy with the results!! This is a must have app for anyone beginning or advanced. Great instructions and also contains a proper cool down.",5
5860,women.workout.female.fitness,"Great beginners program I am a very heavy person and most workout apps are full of hardcore exercises that I cannot physically do. With many of the routines on this app if I can't do something due to physical limitations I can swap that particular exercise for another in that family. Weak wrists can't support my weight, no prob! Try these wall push-ups. Not sure how to do an exercise? Watch this video! After 1 month I am 12 pounds down and going strong, which has never happened with another app!",5
5861,women.workout.female.fitness,This is a simple app to use. I paid for it outright so I didn't have to deal with ads. I really dig the structured workouts and links to videos if I'm not sure by the little diagram. It is quite a good for the inexpensive price. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for straight forward and simple work outs,5
5862,women.workout.female.fitness,"My husband and I do this together. The workouts are not intimidating and anyone can do them, even at a beginner level. Even at the beginner level, we felt it the next day. You can increase the intensity or difficulty but because its so user friendly, we arr encouraged to continue. It takes about 15-30 for each one. Love this app.",5
5863,women.workout.female.fitness,I like this app. It offer's multiple workouts. It allows you to set a reminder so you can stay consistent on these workouts and they actually work. It pervides customizing options so you can target the preferred area's you would like to work out the most. Plus there other apps like this that target even more area's. Good job to the creative minds behind these apps. üëç,5
5864,women.workout.female.fitness,"I really love this app! I love how it has stuff like pre and post stretches for running, full body workouts, morning and night routines, and an option to change how long an exercise is or take one out and replace it with something else. One thing I would like to have is that I could just make my own thing, such as a 5 minute stretch session while I'm on break üòâ",5
5865,women.workout.female.fitness,"Love this app!!! great to keep you motivated! easy to use. this app shows you what/how to do each work out, tells you how long to them and you can customize which workouts to do and how many to do!!! keeps track of calories and your days. the 30 second pause is a little long in between.",5
5866,women.workout.female.fitness,I have struggled to get back into being motivated! I became really fit and small and then moved. It didn't take long to gain back all of the weight. Finally I have pushed and stayed with it and I have started to notice a difference. I like this app because you can combine several of the workouts to get a good session in!,5
5867,women.workout.female.fitness,i love this app so much. im not really the most atheltic type but i wanted to start exercising more regularly. this app makes it easy! it tracks your progress and the exercises really do help. I've only bee using it for about two weeks but i can tell as i keep going its effective! it also makes me feel energized and more confident myself. it also has different levels for most of the exercises so if you are a beginner (like me) it starts you off easy & you can try exercises a little more intense,5
5868,women.workout.female.fitness,I've been using this app for a couple of weeks and I love it! There are enough different routines to keep me interested while still keeping it really simple. I travel full time so it's really important to me to have exercises I can do anywhere without equipment and this app is perfect. My only complaint is that there are quite a few ads but I love that it's free so I guess you can't have it both ways.,5
5869,women.workout.female.fitness,I really like this app. I'm a fulltime working single mom and getting to the gym was quite difficult. This app allows the user to go at their own pace and allows significant water breaks. I think its useful as I sweat after every work and I feel good. I feel good about my balanced out diet with this workout. I'm able to do it while my daughter does her own thing as none of the single workouts go over 30 minutes.,5
5870,women.workout.female.fitness,"I've only used this app today making the 3rd time and I honestly love it. The workouts are mama friendly and I love the way they start from beginner, intermediate and advanced. I like that you can do beginner as many times as needed until you hit the next level. I'd recommend this app to anyone out there so far(: I feel so much more confident after downloading it and doing the exercises‚ù§",5
5871,women.workout.female.fitness,"This is honestly helping me so much and I've only had it for a few days. I've burned so many calories and I feel great after doing them because it's like an achievement! I also really enjoy the voice that lets me know how much time I have left and how said workout is helping towards my goal. I do have an issue with how many ads there are though because I would like to get straight to the workout, I feel like there are also better ways to place the ads.",5
5872,women.workout.female.fitness,"Part of starting a new healthy habit is making yourself do the thing repeatedly until you can reprogram your brain from ""Ugh, I don't wanna do that!"" to ""Isn't it time to do the thing?"" These little 5-minute workout bites feel much more doable than committing to a 20+ minute workout. Exercise gets easier with time if you find something you like (hello endorphins!) and after starting this app I've worked out every day for 25 days. I've only lost a little weight but I feel stronger and happier!",5
5873,women.workout.female.fitness,"This app, is a good app to use. It has everything, to keep you fit when you reach your goal. Throw out my experience, I started to see some changes to my body and I never felt like this before. It has ,warm ups, and workouts that can really make you break a sweat. So anyways, if someone's reading this, then I recommend doing this workout or if the creators is reading it, then thank you!",5
5874,women.workout.female.fitness,"I've tried a few of these apps and this one is by far my favourite one. Quick, easy and effective exercises to keep motivation up. My first day was only 10 minutes but I feel the work out. I also like how it allows you to continue on to the next exercise in your own time in case you want to take longer or quicker, and options for a rest period or to skip it. Really good app I'm looking forward to continue my 28 day challenge",5
5875,women.workout.female.fitness,"I love this app because it helps motivate me to workout and become the best version of myself. It tells me the best workout plans and it also has other optional workouts that can tone your arms,get your booty more in shape, it has thigh workouts and many other workouts. I also love that it personally picks your workout plan by the options that you choose before using that app itself. I 100% recommend this for anyone who is finding motivation hard and I hope you love the app as much as I love it.",5
5876,women.workout.female.fitness,"Always offers a great variety of different workouts for different parts of the body and different fitness goals. I don't care for the ads, but it is worth it if you're not wanting to spend the money for the premium, ad-free version. I also love that they display examples of how to do each exercise & make it customizable to each user.",5
5877,women.workout.female.fitness,"Its absolutely great! Well, to my experience and opinion of course. It helps me keep track of my workout and even how much water i need to drink, which is very helpfull for me cause im very dehydrated all the time and forget that water even exists in my kitchen. Im glad theres also streching workouts that work very well for me. Honestly i dont even mind the ads! I do need to watch an add if i want to do a workout but its short to a max of 5-10 seconds. I 100% reccomend this app!",5
5878,women.workout.female.fitness,I love this app. I started with the total body workout (which gradually challenged me daily ) and added one of the 5 min targeted workouts as well. The gradually challenge really makes you feel like you are reaching those next goals with ease.,5
5879,women.workout.female.fitness,Though I haven't been consistent with the app I overall like the app and the workouts. I like the variety off exercises and really appreciate that they offer videos to ensure your doing the exercises correctly. I would like to be able to do more with my profile such as update my profile goals and what not otherwise I've been happy.,5
5880,women.workout.female.fitness,"It's so easy. Non tiring and it's timing for both the workouts and rest are perfectly synched. The duration is short too, this enables you workout before work with a short duration and do other things for the preparation of the day. It builds self confidence with the congratulations at the end of each workout routine. You shouldn't miss this.",5
5881,women.workout.female.fitness,"Great app. It has lots of workouts. My favs are the sleep strench and the Lowe back pain, as is what I need atm As any other free apps it has adds but overall its great. Short workout, straight forward easy exercises in the finger tip.",5
5882,women.workout.female.fitness,"I dont have a lot of time. So the quick short workouts make me feel like im getting my exercise in in between all the big stuff in my life, which is great! The tips and prompts during each set are also very helpful.",5
5883,women.workout.female.fitness,"This app is really great. I have never found exercising fun until I downloaded this app. I'm on day 5 today and I can say it has been functioning really these days making it quite interesting to exercise. What I like about it is that it has almost everything. You can track how much time your exercises took, how many calories you have burned and they keep popping up with different exercises everyday of which that makes you curious about tomorrow's exercises.",5
5884,women.workout.female.fitness,I have been using the free exercises for quite some time now. It is one of the cheapest app that provides you with yoga and fitness exercises that include seated exercises. The diversity is interesting and I might go for premium if I am motivated enough to keep going with my fitness plan.,5
5885,women.workout.female.fitness,"This app is the best why it's the best is the best working out for women. They don't want to get that kind of board workout like make you have apps they want to get less fatter because when you're in school, a high school or in t hindered on or anything like that you'll be bullied because you're fat. And that's why I liked up because I was fat. And basically I'm losing a lot of that bad. It's a going, it's a skilliness. Thank you for this workout. App I gave it a five out of five I'll Doing an",5
5886,women.workout.female.fitness,"Very good app for daily workout...And there is a variety of courses, most of which are free(without premium). Ads are also less.",5

5888,women.workout.female.fitness,I enjoy every moment I use the app to work out at home through the guidance of the instructor. I would recommend it to everyone planning to keep fit...But would you mind upgrading it for use even when one is offline please?,5
5889,women.workout.female.fitness,"I love this app. I have fibromyalgia so exercising proves to be difficult for me but I can chose the exercises I want to do and do it at my own pace. I like the way it's set out, it gives you instructions on how to do the exercise before you do it so you have a guide. I would definitely recommend because of you're like me and new to exercising this will ease you into it. It's a fun app so hopefully I'll be able to do it bit by bit and build up my strength.",5
5890,women.workout.female.fitness,"This is a wonderful app. I enjoy doing exercises coz it includes music, voice instructor and the work out plans are very nice with the rest period.",5

6000,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,The workouts are pretty good and you are able to change the difficulty to better fit the challenge you want each time. 1 star out of 5 for the sleazy placement of controls to constantly lead you to total junk and spam links. Would rate 0 for how bad they are,1
6001,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Upd. Changed my rating to one star after not getting a reply from the developers. Just do your job! || The app doesn't record a rest day sometimes, ruining my streak! Can't fix it. What's the point of tracking consistency when the app just fails to do it without a glitch! Very annoying.",1
6002,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Loved this app till the garbage dating ads started making freeze all the time. Please fix the bugs or offer (and yes it's that annoying) a paid version to make them go away,1
6003,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Changing from 5 stars to 1 star. I dont know what happened to this app. There is no variation whatsoever. Im getting the same set of exercises everyday. There used to be so much variety. For some reason, my wife has more variation on her iphone. Is it a different version on android?",1
6004,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Please please please, can you fix this because this is like the best quality workout app and you still haven't fixed it. I am absolutely sorry if I am not realising how long it takes and that's ok but I can't deal with it anymore otherwise I'm getting a different app and I really do not want to do that so please!",1
6005,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,some excersices just damage your ligiments and hurt in unsafe way. these apps dont know what they are asking you to do. immediately uninstall,1
6006,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I am Rakksan son of parimala that work is very useful for kho kho state match . So kindly thank for the app,1
6007,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"If there's one thing I absolutely hate about this app, it's that it doesn't have a countdown timer for some excerises like bicycle crunches while the Increase Height Workout app has a countdown timer for those exercises. This is very annoying as I have to keep track of how many I do which I often tend to lose count of and end up doing more than necessary. This prevents me from moving on to the next excerise in a timely fashion and serves to discourage me from ever starting a workout.",1
6008,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"It has three different sound options, but other than muting all sounds (including the one that tells you time is up on one exercise or to move on to the next) there is no option to shut that annoying ticking sound up that plays during the entire plank exercise for example. I'd rather concentrate listening to my music than have to listening to this maddening ticking. Please fix for 5 stars.",1
6009,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Three big issues: 1. I cannot hear anything other than a ping when the timer is up. 2. There is no lead in time for the exercises, they just start 3. I have to touch the phone to start the next exercise. I don't want to touch the phone unless I absolutely have to, I just want to work out. Those that are based on a number vs timed should have a cadence to keep up with. Expected more for my 4.99",1
6010,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Excessive FULL screen ads WITH audio and NO X to exit. I was not able to get to the actual workout. Ads with every little click as I was adjusting the workout settings. I don't mind ads at the bottom, I also don't mind paying for apps, but this many ads in a workout app before even getting to the workout? Sheesh! Uninstalling.",1
6011,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I clicked on the button to see what the premium version offers, and didn't buy, because i didn't like it. All of a suddent after hours of exiting the app, while browsing twitter, the premium purchase one tap appears. Absolute scam, this is so wrong. I was lucky to see the prompt, other people might not be, uninstalling.",1
6012,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"This app is insanely frustrating. It shows way too many ads and there is no way to exit out of them on my device. Workouts are ok, but without other activity and good eating it would most likely not work for other people. Almost all of the ads have this problem, but it is mainly the Call of Duty one.",1
6013,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Caution! I herniated a disc while doing the 2 up 1 downs/heals to the heavens. Really be careful with the exercises you do and always put form first and formost. I think that while most of the exercises on the app are good some of the more advanced ones or high risk ones like these are more something you should do with a personal trainer to ensure correct form amd prevent injury.,1
6014,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Despite having a beginner mode, do not be fooled into thinking this app is for beginners. It starts off fine but after a week the workouts become increasingly reliant on existing core strength. Whats more is i'm seeing comments from the devs about recommended weight loss prior to harder workouts. However, never does the app itself provide any weight management guidance or advice.",1
6015,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Adding your own animated videos ruined the app for me. Linking to expert YouTube videos was much better as one would learn proper form and also any other things to be aware of. But these new animations are no different than the default ones. I only go to video when I need detailed instructions on an exercise. Health experts would do this best. But yiyr jew animations replacing videos are useless. They're just the exact same gifs in video format,1
6016,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Body and mind full clear in this excercise,1
6017,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I would give 5 stars but I did not get 6 pack in 30 days,1
6018,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"There are too many ads, you can't even exit out of the ads because they are full screen and take you to the app store every time you try to click on the X. I've tried everything but it somehow restarts everything, please fix this.",1
6019,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Edit: Guys it's confirmed!! The app couldn't care less if you repeatedly and continuously, give a thumbs down to a workout because you either get injured, too hard or don't know how to do it. Even after a week where you have to keep skipping excersices it'll still give out those excersices cause the only thing it cares about is putting an ad between your workout. üëç",1
6020,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Like what others said, App was good in beginning but has exponentially gone down because of the over use of adds by the company. Constant 10,20,30 second unskipable adds make the app essentially useless and not worth using. Its a workout app. Its sad the people in the company lack the proper amount of brain power to realize how moronic of a decision this was. Like get some common sense.",1
6021,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,As soon as watch the video money back guarantee program I uninstalled the app. Working out is never easy and and 45 minutes a week and it is easy! No way. It was like listening to bad car or insurance salesman. High intensity interval training is Polar opposite of easy. Anyone tried would tell you that and 15 mins of 3 times of a week will not get result as fast as they claimed especially without nutrition plans. Just use their app if you like don't buy any programs.,1
6022,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"After finshed day one they transfered me to another page called ""Able"" i thought its part of the app not an ad duo to my bad english which asked for my email to come with a health plane and too many very private questions at the end they asked me to transfer amount 1-13$ i hope they clearfiy what is part of the app and whats not thanks.",1
6023,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"What the hell this app does this?! When I tap, to open the app, during startup I been noticing my volume is very low like I couldn't hear the app, so I investigate did some test, During the app startup I raised the volume to 100%, then an ad. appeared then it made my volume to 30% I had done a screen video recording to show you what I mean, anyway this is ridiculous please fix this issue otherwise I will definitely tell my followers that this app is not helping.",1
6024,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Was good until about a few days ago, DO NOT DOWNLOAD WASTE OF TIME NOW!! Ads make this app completely unusable ((EDIT FOR DEVS)) After an ad is displayed it no longer Let's me press the ""X"" too close the ad making it impossible unless I turn off the wifi too use the app",1
6025,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I don't mind ads, I understand I am the product bering sold to advertisers when I use a free app. But full screen ads that I cannot close until they finish playing? These are unacceptable. Advertising becomes offensive when it is forced on the person being advertised to.",1
6026,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Adds dont close so unable to run the application properly. I can still do the exercises as it shows what to do before you start but it gets rid of progress tracking and timers.,1
6027,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Warning! This app puts an adware virus into your phone. My phone kept getting random ads popping out of nowhere since I installed this. When I did a little research I thought that the only new app I installed was this one. Once I Uninstalled it my phone was back to normal. Shame on the producers for this app! This should be banned!,1
6028,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Can't stop it in the middle, have to close the app; Stop sync with Google fit since day 3; nowhere I can find to contact developer for refund. 6/5 update, sent email over a week, no any response. Terrible service. I took a star out.",1
6029,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Eventually ads become unremovable unless you go continue through lengthy ad company pitched I don't mind ads disturbing me. The problem is when ads appear but never disappear (and no way to remove). I put my phone down for 15 minutes and the ad was still playing, and still no means to close.",1
6030,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"If I could give less than 1 star I would. Pop ups ruin the experience when viewing tutorials. I watched a tutorial mid workout to check my form and the pop up wouldn't close after I viewed. Couldn't finish my workout. Don't download this app, go elsewhere for your ab workout inspiration",1
6031,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,good for working out. But randomly pops up ads anytime you're doing something else. in the middle of a game unrelated to this app and an ad pops up? screwing up my game and then causing me to double click opening webpages. I wouldn't reccomend due to ads popping up whenever.,1
6032,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"""NO information from developer."" You seriously expect us to change the Android system b'cuz you are too lazy to write why the app and system need to be changed? Are 2-3 words too much for you? ... there _are_ other apps that have more respect for end users.",1
6033,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Seemed good - but the ads......It's obvious NOONE has ever actually vetted the ads they use - they are all scam ads, with scam links. When you are working out and hands are sweaty, like me you can accidently click one of these ads and they take you to a major scam site. It's clear this is just a ad revenue farm and they don't care about us getting scammed. Will look for a app that values our safety.",1
6034,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I currently dont have alot of ab strength so I wanted to get abs in a short amount of time so I download this app, the only thing is, I cant do the exercises. This app will be no good if i can not get the exercises done properly, so if you currently dont have much ab, you will be better off doing your own work outs.",1
6035,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,not bad but difference between level 2 and level 3 is way too big. I cannot repeat level 2 because it's too easy and at the same time I cannot do properly level 3 because it's too hard and there's no way to customize it.,1
6036,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I have used this app for 3 month and did all the exercises but i don't see much improvements.Actually i have used almost every kind of fitness apps on playstore and i has been doing these exercises from last 2 years but these apps are not much useful.Actual use of these apps are to keep your fat constant. Don't expect much these apps!!!!!,1
6037,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"At first it was a good exercise routine and the sets and reps were attainable and empowering, within 12 days they doubled and I struggled to keep up and hurt my lower back by forcing the reps. I would not recommend this for a beginner, get a trainer or friend to help out and allow your body the time it needs to rest and actually progress.",1
6038,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I was looking for an app to make physical changes. I tried the hardest level for the whole period with no success. At the end this app did not help me at all. So I am still looking ...,1

Most exercises are ment for someone who is thin, like plank, push ups etc. +Positive + addictive + conditions your body + workout tracking + Back pain completely stopped after week. - Negative - Misguided, you never see result anywhere close to the app. - No diet plan - Most exercises are for someone who is fit or active. -I lost 15 lbs in a month with strict low calorie diet, these exercises daily with additional exercises.",1
6040,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I feel bad for the obese people who wants to use this app. Some later exercises adds just out of nowhere 5 new steps, its like having a tutorial for doing a backflip and the first step is to do a backflip.",1
6041,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"App had potential, but like most was ruined by the incompetent individuals who ruined their app with dumb adds. Its a workout app. Not an advertising platform. Get into advertisement if you wanna spam people with 30 second adds. Dont bother installing this app, its garbage now.",1

6043,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,This app is so bad I had done accurately all exercise but then also no six pack came only I loss some weight but not more I had an extra exercises with that exercise and also done dighting .

If anyone want a fit body you can install but if u want to make 6 pack , don't install it. One single app can't make 6 pack. .

I cant give you more than 1 star till you change your method in that respect. hight vs weight is hard to calculate but if you wish to promote your app you need to take the time to go in depth. 195-200 is ideal for my body type any less and I would begin to look sickly thin.",1
6051,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Definitely doesn't make you lose any belly fat. I've done this program for a month and unfortunate to say I still haven't lost any belly fat, to be honest I don't notice a single difference.

6056,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"App is fine, but I'm giving it one star for advertising itself as ""lose belly fat"" inside of the app. That's wrong and misleading.

6064,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Im someone who is trying to workout and have it show. But before i even started to use it i looked at the reviews and its quite clear that nearly every review is fake. Theres just very suspicuous reviews and every single one is positive and most use emojis and lets be honest no one uses those in a review and their just to grab attention dont waste your time downloading this waste of storage,1
6065,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Ive been doing this for 20+ days and nothing has change I've always been fit but not had defined abs I have been doing it on the hardest difficulty and doing the workout twice a day rather than just the once and nothing has happened so it's a 1 star from me.,1
6066,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I do like the app but the problem is I like the old version better for some reason I missed a couple of days of workouts when I wasn't even aware I was ahead it's honestly but I will still use the app but you guys have to fixs this.,1
6067,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"So fu***** bad , dont trust this app you will not see any progress , go check youtube and get knowledge , its way better than using this app , personal i have shredded abs , and i saw the advanced workout they are so easy and for begginers ,so i guess the owner of the app dosnt know a shi* about abs training he is just given you som exsersices which dosnt have effect and thats why i give it 1 star !!",1

6070,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I dont understand why people think that doing weird ab circuits is the best why to get abs. The best way to do this is to get abs is to get in a calorie deficient (eating below your maintenance calorie intake) and doing ab excersies like ANY OTHER MUSCLE GROUP. So this means doing like 3 sets of how many reps til close to failure. I would just chose 2-3 different excersies for abs alone.,1

6197,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Nice,1
6198,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"""NO information from developer."" You seriously expect us to change the Android system b'cuz you are too lazy to write why the app and system need to be changed? Are 2-3 words too much for you? ... there _are_ other apps that have more respect for end users.",1
6199,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I already have is app on my tablet and I can't install it on my Lab top,1
6200,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"App is great except they've implemented unstoppable 30 sec ads which are over the top annoying. I have to reset the app to ""skip"" the ad, which just deleted my workout progress for the day üò† I get it, the devs need to make money but these ads are so annoying. I may as well write down my own charts and copy the workouts into paper which is advertisement free! Please just stick to 5 sec skippable ads. Thank you!",2
6201,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I understand ads are necessary, but there were so many on this app, and little distinction between skipping an ad and skipping a workout... that you'll end up getting confused and not doing the full work out you intended. As well as requiring to hold your phone throughout the whole exercise. This app needs to be less demanding. Otherwise, the collection of exercises was good.",2
6202,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I started doing these to increase my core strength. I was very impressed at first. it was simple to follow the program, but as i went on i started getting back pains. I researched the exercises and turns out some of them are literally destroying your lower back. The worst being the ""Russian twist"". Never twist your spine while its under tension - its a grade A way to mess your back up. I still ise the app, but now skip all the bad exercises, and this obviously doesn't give the same burn.",2
6203,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Tried Advanced free trial. Exercise intensity though can be tweaked, default intensity won't give you 6 pack. It did improve my core to some extent with controlled diet. Voice coach is poor. Exercise and breathing instructions should be given during rest time. Lots of waste spaces in landscape mode where buttons and ? can be bigger and more press intuitive.",2
6204,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"The timer lags. I've been using a different ""six pack"" app for all my core workouts (6 pack promise) but I thought I'd try something new. I just did not like this app. It wasn't very challenging, and worst of all the timer would pause a little longer every few numbers. I also think the rounds that do reps instead of intervals are a bit disruptive because then I have to tap my phone. Also disruptive-- ads and all the notifications. I deleted ASAP.",2
6205,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Too many unwanted exercises with short resting time which leads to muscle cramps. I personally prefer the Athlean X app which has a far better exercise progression. Also for newbies, don't trust an app which provides you little resting time between upper and lower ab exercises, you'll cramp. I give it 2 stars because they have demo videos. Also, people abs are revealed in the kitchen, diet is key!!",2
6206,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I'm on day 2 and already getting annoyed. The first day was fine, no issues. Today though, the app crashed multiple times during the workout, which was highly disruptive. I was still able to continue the workout however once I was done I found that the app was picking up where it left off but it only tracked the exercises I finished off with after the last crash. If this becomes a common occurrence I'll be uninstalling.",2
6207,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"The app is great and helpful for all level of workout enthusiasts. But the ads are really embarrassing, I can never open this app in public. I don't want to meet any cleavage showing Paru or whatever. One should be able to choose ad content or at least reject a certain category. I've checked my Google ad settings and they are fine, it's you guys pushing such ads. I can buy the ad-free pro version but I won't be forced into doing so.",2
6208,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"This app is pretty good but it isn't worth the effort, you could go to gym and get a way better result, it isn't worth the memory/space so don't download it. Plus if you go to gym, you're getting out from your house, going somewhere other than there, so don't get the app, you get better results at gym and you can be helped at gym, I did not get abs in the 30 days so it is falsely advertising something. Your technique could be incorrect and you could be doing all this work for nothing. Thank you",2
6209,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Just installed the app and gave it a try. Looked great until the ad appeared (audible) which I could not stop. Even after watching the ad I could not continue with the workout since the app was not responsive. I had to restart the app and continue the workout. But then it happened again - ad that could not be stopped and app freezing - then I gave up using the app at all,2
6210,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Once you enter your weight, you can't change it. You can clear all data, but not specific data points. One mis entry and you have to either restart everything or live with one bad data point. If you let me fix mis-entered data I'd give this app a 5!",2
6211,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Purchased it in 2020 but I still have to see many ads to use the product . Advise DO NOT pay for the app. Use it with ads . Its good UPDATE After posting review the developer has rectified the issue , which several emails did not. Wonderful app as such which I have been using for last 2 years.definitely a keep",2
6212,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I used a couple of the options (beginner and intermediate). However, be CAREFUL wktb the use. A lot of the excercises do not target muscle movement in the direction of muscle fibers. Also, some excercises that should target abs end up targeting hip flexors.",2
6213,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I know they need to out ads but some ads just don't go away even after waiting for 60 seconds. I tried hitting close button many times and even click open. On open the website of advertisement opens but still ad doesn't go away from this app. I wish I could attach screen shot to the review,2
6214,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Many of the exercises hurt me. I did 15 days of this and did not receive results but instead actually became weaker (joints started hurting or felt weak, wasn't as strong as I was before) and this wasn't because I was sore either. The only reason this isn't a 1 is because of the few exercises that actually somewhat worked. (Crunches, Flutter kicks) Honestly, if you want to lose fat or obtain abs, I recommend going onto YouTube instead. They have better exercises videos.",2
6215,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"App is well designed and easy to follow but in the end doesn't work. I did both the intermediate and advanced workouts for the 30 days each, with about a 1 week break in between, and saw zero change in physique. Yes of course diet, exercise, etc. play a part in this but that's not how the app is advertised hence the low rating. ***Additional edit in response to app designer's reply - my body fat % is 16% so your assertion is untrue.",2
6216,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,The last thing I want to hear when I'm holding a plank or trying to relax in a stretch is a bloody ticking clock sound. Terrible. Thanks for reminding me of every second I am holding my plank and giving me no way to mute only the ticking. Oh and the ads are now out of control..,2
6217,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Stats are inaccurate. Accidentally quit the app in the middle of a workout, restarted app a few seconds later, resumed workout, and the app only recorded my workout for the time after resuming. Totally lost all the parts of the workout I had completed before Accidentally quitting. Once app is fixed, I'll bump up rating.",2
6218,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Exercise selection is out of date. Whomever selected the exercises for the routines doesn't know their anatomy. Side cruches do not work you internal or external obiques. The abdominal muscle group made up of 10 muscles. The workouts in this app primarily focus on the Rectus Abdominus muscles, 2 of those 10. The routines seem to ignore how the abdominal group works. You'd be better of doing 4 sets tabata timed dumbell thrusters.",2
6219,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Lot of mistakes in intermediate workouts. The second set on intermediate starts with out 30 secs rest. There is no tic tic sounds on rest time in front of some workouts like bend leg twist and flutter kicks etc . Plank time is not updated as per days . The app is pathetic when it compared to ios app. In ios there is real men indicators instead of animation. Then there is an option for give fat percentage in ios. And there is music too.,2
6220,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"this seems like a bad copy of ""Lose Weight app"" from the same developer. The ticking sound for every second passed is very annoying and I can't turn it off.",2
6221,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Something with the home workout app that this does not provide is the flexibility of modifying the rest time between exercise sets. That's a major deal breaker for me. I'll have to uninstall in a few days.,2
6222,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,App is not as customizable as other from this company. Can't turn off the annoying clock ticking or adjust rest time between exercises. Makes me not like using it.,2

6224,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I do all the exercises consistently for a month, I enjoy it but it gives a bit of benefits. This app didn't so helpful in fat loss. I thought it help me for fat loss but no too much.",2
6225,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"No doubt, if I wanted a heavy straining workout plan I've would've never installed this APP, I'm not out of shape and I'm not exactly in shape either ya feel me, I just thought this APP had a workout plan that's compatible with my time and needs, unfortunately it doesn't, no hard feelings... Peace‚úåÔ∏è",2
6226,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"30 seconds rest after 5 leg raises? You must be kidding.  30 seconds rest after each exercise, and you can‚Äôt even turn it off or set the rest time.  There is no indication about how long each session is.  No built-in videos ‚Äì only animation.",2
6227,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Did the 90 months, 3 levels: no abs. Maybe a smaller belly though that is mostly diet. Note they lie in the description; You will need a dumbbell to perform a couple of the exercises. 2 starts for the app overall usability and features",2
6228,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Total lie...you can't get abs like that by targeting abdomen muscles. Only by reducing overall body fat you can achieve that. Unfortunately, you can't target abs like that. Make it 1000 days instead of 30 you still won't have a single set of abs untill you have a low body fat percentage. Unlike biceps, abs can't be targeted. Overall a good app otherwise, easy to use.",2
6229,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I wish there was an option to choose the old routine wherein planks were 1 min in rock hard abs, used it before and started working out again but i actually prefer the old routines.",2
6230,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Didnt give me a six pack. Some exersises were good others were probably bad for joint, for example the were some vshred exersises. I would just recomend buying a work out plan if you're not sure what you are doing or going to the gym and getting a personal trainer. I gave it 2 stars because the ads are non intrusive and some of the exersises are good.",2
6231,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Earlier everything was all right but when switch to harder training the app started to repeat the same exercise 4 to 5 times which make the training very boring,2
6232,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"this is fun, but later it becomes repetitive. the exercises are just the same form beginning and the end, that us why stopped using it. plus i thought you said no equipment",2
6233,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I don't know how anyone make six pack using this app. Because in this app does not exist any diet plans. I used and exercised with this app but i didn't get any results because i was eating my meals with no planing. Please add diet plans also then we can get perfect resuo,2
6234,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"If the goal is to make my hips and lower back hurt then I would rate 5 stars. The 2D animated graphics suck at showing you what you're supposed to do, I suggest improving them or making it real people.",2
6235,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"App stopped working. Reinstalled and it opened, so I synced my Google account and it crashed again. I've uninstalled it, cleared storage and cache, but the second I sync my account, it crash.",2
6236,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,It's an good app but after the update it doesn't work properly I have complet 15 workout in the 3rd month but it shows all the 30 day are completed and it doesn't work properly. It need one updat for fixing the problem,2
6237,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,The app is good and all but the workouts themselves are easy. Im on the advanced one and i skip the rests and do 4 extra reps each time and its so easy i dont even break a sweat.,2
6238,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Incomplete. I did the workout every day for thirty days and though it was a good workout, i still did not have ""rock hard abs"" by the 30 day mark. I had barely budding abs. And some days after the workout i remetabolized the abs.",2
6239,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I want to lose weight around my abdomen. That's all I want. But thanks to a manual wheelchair, I have very minimal leg power. So the amount of exercises I can actually do drops to maybe 3 at best",2
6240,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Okay app but the ticking clock and extremely loud bell is very annoying. Providing users the option to disable this would improve your ratings,2
6241,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Could definitely be better, it just reuses the same plans and workouts over and over. They expect 3 straight sets of 20 crunches and then completely avoids the lower portion of abs on most exercises. If you want your top 2 or 4 abs jacked do this program.",2
6242,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"After completing 3 times advance level, 2 times intermediate level , I got not a single visible abs, only gym workout can give the actual result not the home workout. üòÄ To developer , before starting workout I had a normal body not the chubby of fatty one and after still I have normal one.",2
6243,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Great way to kill your spine if you use it as it wants you to. Better as inspiration because it gave me ideas about exercises that I didn't know they exist.,2
6244,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Guys sorry to say this ,this is a good app it gives u a proper workout and it keeps track of your fitness but I can't c any developments in my abs well it does reduce your belly fat but my abs are not visible. I may not be sure so I did the whole 90 workout and 30 advance level twice no development so I may not work for all .",2
6245,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I mean I havnt tried this myself but I think it's safe to assume that ur not going to get a 6 pack u can workout as hard as u want but at the end of the day its diet that matters the most the workouts only do 20 percent of the work diets do 80 percent that's just so unrealistic but I guess it would be good for doing exercises in general and better to workout then do nothing at home,2
6246,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Tick tock tick tock, remove the clocks tick tock or atleast let us choose if we want it or not. If I mute, then coach tips also gets muted. Have a switch for clock too, please.....",2
6247,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Some good workouts here however i used it for 30 days to remove belly fat. I did not lose weight nor did my belly shrink at all. App advertised Bodbot which i download and feel im making more progress with,2
6248,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Ads with sound that's louder than app itself. Extra awesome if listening to music when working out.,2
6249,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Allow the user to create their own program. Also, the human body needs 48..72 hours to recover from strenous exercise. Allow the user to select the rest period and make reminders obey that instead of scheduling reminders to specific days of week. If you want to list rest days like the app does now, change the 3 workout days + 1 rest day to 1 workout day + 1-2 days of rest: The pace assumed to be followed is a surefire way to overtrain and injure oneself (guaranteed results in 30 days!)",2
6250,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,It has pop up ads which waste my data. The app works well for working out. due to the popup ads I don't recommend it.,2
6251,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"App used to be great, but now is a huge sellout especially on IOS where you have to pay for plans YEARLY. Android also doesnt have the real life coach, only the 3d models.",2
6252,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I liked the app for a while but now I can't get the stupid pop ups off the screen to go on to the next work out. Damn geeks!!!,2
6253,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Its been a great start i dont need to loss weight or anything just want to get my abs back its been a couple years since i had them it shocks the muscle witch what i belive you should do every time you work out,2
6254,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,It is okay but make it harder it is way to easy for example: plank why only 30 seconds why not 1:00 or 2:00. My point is make things a little more challenging.,2
6255,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"A few of the exercises are good but do not do crunches or sit ups, you can herniate a disk. Also the only way to get a six pack is either have the genes for it and/or follow a very strict diet. Stick to planks and variations of it to lose belly fat and tighten your abs.",2
6256,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Its a Meh kind of app but it has the same exercises and most of them dont help about yout abs at all. So it is kinda really bad. If you wanna get abs faster than this app,do pushups for your belly. It really works!",2
6257,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"First I thought the app was good, but it began to bug and stopped me from looking at stuff so I couldn't learn proper form.",2
6258,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"We cant make a six pack,to show to others ,only abdomen strengthennig. Its a best app for abdomen strengthennnig. You should include more fitting exercise",2
6259,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,i mean its not very effective because i definitely didn't get abs in 30 days but the exercises are some what helpful and the stretching part is very helpful,2
6260,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"This app does not improve your abs it's missing cardio workouts for good abs. I used this app and followed the instructions well for a 30 days, but my abs were showing just a little bit.",2
6261,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I used this app for about 20 days and now i'm having too much pain in m backbone and neck ,it's because this app recomends exercise without warming up and wrong position which isn't clear throught plus it doesn't have a diet chart",2
6262,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I have been doing this for almost 8 months and still no results shown and I didn't start out fat either. The 30 day plan doesn't help and I have been doing all my exercises from the advanced (except first month which was intermediate),2
6263,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Not goodüëé. I use it regularly 22 days and nothing seems to happen. So I save my rest 8 days by installing another one.,2
6264,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Good app but too ads pop up even when the app is not open. Not cool. Makes me concerned about viruses,2
6265,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,This app 8s very great f9r body building .i Amazed to see the graphics of this game. It is really really very good,2
6266,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"After completing the entire ""Rock Hard Abs"" 30 day routine, I saw no results. A complete waste of time and disappointment.",2
6267,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Needs Android TV or Chromecast support. And where's an option to change to kilojoules? We don't use calories here in Australia.,2
6268,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,On intermediate lvl and 9 days left till it's over and onto the hard lvl.. I haven't lost enough weight and no abbs gain.. so far not so good.,2
6269,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,No easy way to pause the timers. It just moves on without you without warning or input.,2
6270,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Good for beginners , for great result do all level workout at a same day ........and don't forget to eat healthy and take a proper diet",2
6271,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Randomly skips days. There's an AD button. It's a present symbol. Don't press it.. Doesn't do anything. Feel like I'll be uninstalling this in the next week.,2
6272,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"not that pretty good. ads all ove the way. ad for the rock ahrd abs section, workouts are all so .so...simple",2
6273,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Very nice app download this app very amazing app for bodybuilders,2
6274,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,It has a good idea overall but they just loop in random ideas of exercises some of which some fat people cannot do,2
6275,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Good excessive choices but nothing will give you abs in 30 days. Even 30 weeks and may get halfway there. But 30 days is a genetic freak level pipe dream. Bs,2
6276,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Not beginner friendly at all. After day 7 it gets extremely hard for beginners when the required sets are increased daily. The first week should be 2 weeks long,2
6277,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,This app does not do what it promise to I completed the workout for entire 30 days without any break But end result is nothing Just few lines that do of four packs appear just after workout but after an hour or so back to normal My belly is still bulging out Even when I opted for rock hard abs My time got wasted,2
6278,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,The Exercises were just to Burn some Calories and not for the Perfect Shape!! They need to include some Good Exercises for that Perfect Six Pack Abs instead of just Burning some Calories,2
6279,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Way to many ads. Good workout though, just way to many ads.",2
6280,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"What about peaple that are thin. I don't see a plan for building up, just weight loss.",2
6281,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"It does not cycle through the routine and you have to keep tapping your phone ""done""",2
6282,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,This doesn't help u ...and it's a waste of time ...I've done the fat losing programme fully and got no result..even though I did everytime on point and was correct,2
6283,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Not bad but they force to see ad to get 3d animation guide . I watch it a 100 times but they dont done their word,2
6284,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Great for beginners for basic core strength but not good you can't do these exercise it's time taking,2
6285,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"why all this app is fantastic for building muscle, it is horrible for trying to burn off fat. If you want to burn fat off of your stomach you need to alter your food intake and what foods you eat. Do not advertise an app for something that does not work the way you want people to believe it to work.",2
6286,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,your daily routines are too hard and put an unnecessary pressure on the heart muscle...im not skinny nor fat and im in a good shape but i didnt get any noticable results from your program although i did everything on the schedule,2
6287,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,i have completed loose belly fat and rock hard abs but still there are not much changes in my body..i still have those troubling love handles.. the app is good but not as good as i expected so i am rating 2 stars,2
6288,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,This app is very good and i think it is good too for others but i will let the other stars as soon iget my six pack in 30 days,2
6289,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,the six pack ab workout isnt likely to get you abs and it is also the same exercise every day in the same order.,2
6290,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,The extreme level of ads make this insulting to use. Which is a shame since it's otherwise a nice app.,2
6291,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"It's Nov 15 , I stopped workout 1 month ago and only gained upper abs which are rarely visible , and obliques , wanted to burn belly but it's like same as it was before wrkout .",2
6292,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,The workout are too long you should make a more short intense workout option but a good app nonetheless,2
6293,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I am thin but have big stomach..i followed this for 30 days but no results!! I think you should add a proper diet plan also in app then only it would work!,2
6294,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Didn't like the fact you do the same exercise twice preferred other apps with more fluidity,2
6295,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,ads just never seem to work forcing me to use the app offline but everything else seems fine,2
6296,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"extremely good,have not yet experienced changes because ive just began,but i love how it trains",2
6297,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Useless I'm useing this full 1month everyday I'm doing exercises but no six packs useless app , my stomach pained , I leave 3day before but still my stomach pain ,not properly guide ,no six pack in month ü§¨ü§¨",2
6298,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Cant delete wrongly added workouts. Some exercises are pretty weird and references/videos of them cant be found online,2

6400,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"The exercises in this app are good. The following are problematic: 1) the calendar is confusing...the UI should make future days gray until available. If I do exercise in morning it looks like I need to do the next day's today 2) the animated pictures can be hard to discern...keep feet off the ground? Put on the ground? Also, a real person doing the exercise would show the real mechanics of the moves. 3) Too many 30 second rests...my assumption is that time under tension is best.",3
6401,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"30 days is very optimistic. You also need to change your diet. As someone with a very weak core, I do appreciate the app. However, after the first 30 days ( no six pack, btw) I couldn't do much of the second plan and had to resort to doing the first plan again in hopes of eventually getting strong enough to do the second plan. And who uses a BMI chart? This app does. These have historically been lauded for inaccuracy.",3
6402,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I've gone through 2/3 of the programs now. This is actually great through the first two. The third makes the exercises upwards of 30 minutes which is fine for some I'm sure but my workout times don't budget for that much to be eaten up almost everyday for an ab workout. I wish there were other options to either make each individual set longer/harder or shorten rests.,3
6403,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Good app. Assuming no prior medical conditions, it is impossible for a user who does the workouts in full, 30 days in a row, at the advanced level, to not build the muscle needed for a 6-pack. lf a user can't feel or see the results, they're either lying to themselves and/or they have a terrible diet. That said, the app could improve in that department. The voice isn't great, but my big beef with it is that I can't get it off phone even after I uninstall it!",3
6404,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Decent workout app, one major problem. When I rate an exercise as thumbs-down ""Will get injured"" I'm not going to do it if it comes up again. Replace those exercises with other ones that aren't a risk to do. Don't just have them keep showing up in my routine! I'm going to skip them, and I'm not going to get in as good of a workout because of that!",3
6405,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Its a wonderful app but it lacks the ability to manually edit individual exercises when you need alter the difficulty. Altering it via the method provided just modifies the whole workout without adding reps to exercises I can blow by. If the developers add the feature to edit each individual exercise independently then I can give them a better rating.,3
6406,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"It's a good app, but there are some issues that I feel hold it back. First of all, the name isn't really accurate. It includes 3 lots of exercises, each lasting 30 days, so it's really Six Pack in 90 days. I just finished the first 30 and I definitely do not have a six pack. My other major issue is that the exercises build well, gradually increasing, for the majority of the 30 days and then suddenly get ridiculous near the end. The last 5 days or so are brutal, with each building too much on the last rather than there being a natural progression. It suddenly throws in push ups with rotation, but there are no regular push ups before this to get you used to the exercise. To just go from no push ups to an advanced form of push ups is ridiculous. There are stretches at the end of each sessions, but only a 10 second rest between the last exercise and the first stretch, which sometimes (depending on the last exercise) just isn't enough time. If they could restructure the exercises a bit and throw in some more options, I'd rate higher, but for now I think 3 is enough.",3
6407,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"A decent app but riddled with ads. There are many difficulty spikes. Say you finish the first 10 workouts and everything appears to be progressing good. it's not too hard and not too easy, on the 11th, you might not be able to finish even 1/3 of the workout. The same keeps happening down the line no matter how much easier you make it. If you ignore the difficulty spikes it's the ads that will eventually push you away. Anything you click will shove an ad in your face first.",3
6408,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"It's a great way to take the thinking out of core exercise. The animations are usually enough to work out the exercise, and you used to be able to click to watch a video of a human doing it if you needed. However, I'm docking 2 stars because they've recently replaced all the videos of humans with a different type of animation. That's not helpful! If the first animation wasn't helpful it's because I need to see a human do it to capture the nuances of the movement.",3
6409,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"The program itself is very nice and the entire interface is easy to use and only partially annoyed by ads. The turn off for me is the difficulty of keeping the statistics in check. You can't delete or restart programs you started by accidents. Rest days count as exercises, etc. Very annoying if you want to follow/ share your progress.",3
6410,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Good variety of exercises. There's a 30 second rest between exercises which is way too long and I couldn't find a way to adjust (why?) Can skip the rest but 3 ways this is annoying: having to press a button between every exercise to shorten the rest; the skip button is too small to be ez to press; after pressing the next exercise timer starts immediately so you have no time to get into position. Other apps do this better!,3
6411,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I tried this app cuz I just wanted to see how fast I can lose 15 pounds WITH DIETING & shape the gut. Well, the good news is that I ended losing 19 pounds in 5 weeks. But this app failed me in getting a 6 pack. I got more of a 2 1/2 pack starting from the top lol. The workouts eventually got monotonous for me. I even started incorporating some moves of my own cuz one recommended exercise messed up my back. I'll probably start the intermediate someday. But atm, It's a no for me dog.",3
6412,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"The app is well designed and the animation helps explaining what the exercise is. There are two problems with it: 1, it contains exercises you shouldn't do without professional help. 2, there is nothing indicating if the speed I should perform the exercises is the one from the animation or the one from the explanation video.",3
6413,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I added 3 stars because I started using this App on 9th/Sept/2023, I'm trying it to get six abs. I love how the app is designed + the animation that's guide me to make different excersices. I'll add the 2stars which is remaining when I'll get the best results after all the month. Thanks to the developers of this APP üôè",3
6414,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Used to love this app. I loved that you could create your own plan to go at your own pace. Now, you HAVE to choose a pre-made plan. You can change the difficulty of the workouts, but I don't see much use in that. At that point, I would just do the pre-made plans. I also bought the ads free version before it became updated, but now I don't have it. That doesn't bother me as much, but it is a little annoying. Good app, but not sure I'll stick with the changes.",3
6415,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,It sometimes make a long work out and it puts pressure but it really does make the six pack,3
6416,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Can't say I recommend this app as the support is atrocious and an app without support is useless, I have sent 2 emails todate with no reply. As for the app it would be very good except that even if you open and look at the training schedule it logs a completed circuit in your history thereby messing up the accuracy of your record of results. The graphics are cool and the audio very clear. Such a pity the developer has let the app down.",3
6417,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"The routines are decent. You should definitely START with breathing instructions. If someone is not used to exercising, that is very valuable information for them to have, BEFORE getting to the END of an exercise. On top of that, your notifications are, well, plain bs. I didn't log in for ONE day (it was a rest day, anyway. I figured I'd check it off today, when I did my next active day). I was rather annoyed when your app sent me a notification saying that I hadn't worked out in ""over 3 days"".",3
6418,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Pretty good so far, especially since I figured out Level 3 would kill me. This app will only function with the screen turned on, though; the rest timer will stop if you turn the screen off or read the explanation for the next exercise.",3
6419,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"The workouts r great however the interface is exteremly annoying. I got a phone call and couldnt go back on an excercise that was ""done"" while I was talking. So I had to restart entire workout and skip everything to get back to were I was which made it loose count of my calories. It also completes days when I looked at it and so my count is messed up. Great work outs terrible unusable interface and recording. Would rate 5 stars if this could get fixed.",3
6420,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I really do think this app will get me from FAT to SKINNY in one month I am putting all my hope in it because these exersices are difficult. But there is one problem only. That problem is that the first cartoon animation is a different animation from the human one at times. What I mean is that both animations are mostly the same the cartoon and human one but at times I look at the cartoon and human animations and for some reason I see the animations are different. Please fox this.,3
6421,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I also have the lose weight for men from this same company, I gave that app 5 stars, but this one could easily get the 5 stars with a few small fixes. 1, the ability to increase or decrease rest time between exercises, and 2, turn the ticking if the clock off from the timer's. I've got my music playing, I don't want to hear tick tick tick thru the whole dam song. But other then that app is super good, easy to use and follow and also easy to read logging of weight and exercise progress.",3
6422,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Was much better before last update. The last update made this app more difficult to use. Why?  Could you make ""back"" key go back and not ask if I want to exit program after looking at exercise instructions.  Also, asking me every time for full access to my photos and media is annoying and excessive.",3
6423,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Good workouts and plan, bad UX. The workouts are challenging and escalating. They recently changed the voice, seemed to slow it down to 50-75% of what is was before. Contradictory to the high energy music I use and a little demotivating. Tried changing the speech settings, but did not affect the output.",3
6424,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Used the app for close to 2 months before it started having audio issues out of nowhere. Its the only app I have that does this. The audio is normal at first but starts screeching in a high pitch about 5 seconds in. Moving on to another app.,3
6425,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I do seem to have injuries at my age that don't allow me to do basic exercises. Shoulder injury stops me from star jumps for example. It should allow me to tailor the exercises to take into account these type of injuries. It should also include warm up stretches. It should also have clearer instructions on the body positions to avoid doing the exercises wrong and injuring those areas. I am not a fat guy but I struggle with a lot of the crunches. Will keep at it though.,3
6426,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"The highest level isn't hard enough for people who want to have rock hard abs, but all you need to do is skip the cool down or only do it for 10 seconds and double the amount set. It is a overall good app and will be useful even if you do have abs.",3
6427,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,This app is superb! It has everything that will make you lose weight very nicely. The overall experience of this app is very nice. There is only one problem that it increases the increases the intensity of workout very fast. This app is not for beginners. This app is for intermediate people like me.,3
6428,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,It would be very much better if there is a meal plan included for each respective levels of difficulty. I am just casually eating whatever food there is and I dont know whether or not its a good benefit towards achieving my goal of having a fit (at the very least good) looking body.,3
6429,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Helpful voice coach, and pretty good for teaching you exercises. However, they aren't all effective, there's not much variety, the ""calories burned"" is ludicrously inaccurate, and NOBODY gets a six pack in 30 days. This app will give you tons of very unrealistic expectations.",3
6430,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"The exercises are challenging and I've definitely seen progress, however, I feel that they should slow down the progression a bit... I started seriously struggling by the end of the advanced level routines.",3
6431,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"It has been so long yet you haven't updated the video for crossover crunches, instead of what it's supposed to show it instead shows an ugly picture for a minute, while your crossover crunch video is on YT, it's so bothersome, will rate higher once you update that, also give us an option when we press skip for break, it gives us 3 seconds to get ready.",3
6432,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"It's is misdirectional of this app stating that you can develop a six pack in 30 days. I used the Homeworkout varient for a month before I tried this, thrn used this one for two months or more (the advanced option with the toughest workout routine). But, developing a six pack isn't that easy, the exercises in this app are surely good for ab workouts, but I guess the product isn't really what it promises. You may as well so ab workouts from the primary ""Home workout"" varient.",3
6433,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,FIX THIS.. sit-ups are BAD.. They are terrible for your back and not giving alternative workouts for sit-ups is both dangerous and negligent. No matter how many times I thumb down the workout or skip it It remains a work out the next day.. Otherwise most of the way through the month now and it's been a very good experience aside from sit-up back pain.,3
6434,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"after 30 days... no difference! Honestly, I'm past 40 and maybe this works for the youth with high metabolism (like the 10 year old other poster) but for older guys it's basically a good 10 minutes of exercise to remind you that you're out of shape. I think maybe if this was a daily regimen I'd see results after a year, perhaps, if added to my other exercises, who knows. Diet isn't an issue as I'm vegan and watch my intake closely. All told it's a nice 30 day addition to regular exercise.",3
6435,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"today day 2 ! Its fun and good would be doing all 3 levels of training for 90 days and will be updating the results , right now giving 3 stars based on the 90 day result i would rate it further . Yes diet factor is taken care of and im not a complete novice ! Do have some knowledge and experience so just giving this a try üí™üíØ hoping for a good change",3
6436,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Idk about the whole 6 pack in 30 days but it's a great app to start the process.. The ads are starting to get longer and more often so idk how much longer I'll be using it for now.. It ruins it and stops your music and just kills the energy and vibe,3
6437,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"People like me hate having to stop the training and click ""completed"" on the phone. Why? Let me train and hear the voice guide me through the ""take a rest"" and ""go"" then ""take a rest"" and ""go"" over and over until I burn out. It's annoying having to cut the training all the time. And funny enough, the app actually starts off well then breaks the rythme. Please solve this, meanwhile I'm downloading a Boxing timer app cuz it does what I want it to do.",3
6438,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Cool app but does one need to do exercises for all begginer , intermediate and advanced so as to get six packs ?",3
6439,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I've only done it once since far and it was the advanced excersices. However, I checked the other ones and the first one is misleading. You can't specifically lose belly fat you just have to do so with cardio or a calorie deficit.",3
6440,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"The training sets are pretty good, I like the audio guidance. However, this app greatly exaggerates calories that you spend. There is no way in hell I burn 200+ cals in 10 minutes while my heartrate stayes under 120 bpm.",3
6441,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Starting from the intermediate plan as 6'2 weighing 185 pounds, I did the entire plan without ever making the regimens harder or easier and without missing a day. I also try keep a relatively healthy diet. After I completed the challenge I weighed 177.1 pounds. The app was helping in creating a routine to follow and I have noticed improvement, but I certainly do not have the desired result. I also don't know where to go from here, since the next plan requires me to actually have abs.",3
6442,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"as a 14 year old teen, im obviously looking to get fit. when i opened the app, i immediately just said no. while being active requires commitment, it doesnt require THAT much commitment. even the beginner level requires determination, and the list of exercises are scrambled and unorganized. while a six pack in 30 days would be realistic for the quantity of exercises listed, i think the list of exercises are in store for some organizing. if this changes, i may reconsider a 4th star.",3
6443,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Good but the almost exemple of exercises can be better if the illustration be more illustrative. You need press the video's icon and go to another page, see the video and back again to the exercise screen where you have a image without movement. But if you have the patience to do that it's ok.",3
6444,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Overall this app is great for working out pushing out the limits until the day 90 but afterwards even day 30 of advanced feels easier...im giving 3/5 only because there needs to be added custom workout option where we can make it more difficult after day 90 according to needs.... Also diet plan must be added to know how much weight im actually losing..,3
6445,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"The app has very good exercises, but I don't like the unwanted ads that pop up when I open other apps on my phone. I don't mind ads when the six pack app is open, but ads keep coming even if the app is closed. That's too much ads.",3
6446,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Not sure if i am doing it right but that 30 days is actually 90 days but it was worth it. At least i don't have to go to the gym. This is a really good app for anyone who dreams of having a six pack because it works although one thing is missing, there should be a option showing the right food to eat to maintain the progress preferably vegetarian",3
6447,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"While I think this app is quite good, I don't think it's realistic as a beginner to be capable of keeping up the their schedule. I did day 1 two days ago, and I am physically incapable of continuing until my abs stop hurting so much. I don't think you're supposed to work out muscles when they're this sore, and I imagine anybody who follows day one as a beginner will be in immense pain for days following. This makes it impossible to stick to the schedule.",3
6448,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"No matter which excercize routine I take, I always end up getting tired from my throat then any other part of my body in the middle of the excercize. I think I shouldn't be having this problem because these excercizes should be targeting my abdomen not my throat. Although I'm not an expert and may be wrong but I think this is wrong and needs to be somehow adjusted from person to person just like the excercize routine can be adjusted or at least needs to be fixed somehow. Other than that, 5 stars",3
6449,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"The content of the app is very good. The exercises and everything are very detailed too. It's just that I do the workout at night in my room with very little light. And opening the app is like a flashbang experience. Add a dark mode please. If you do, I'll change the rating to a 5 starts.",3
6450,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Not a bad app but I really wish it didn't matter what diet a person is on.My results don't look as advertised,3
6451,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I just downloaded this app. I do not see an option to change the interval between excercises only to skip it all togther. Any way this feature can be added?,3
6452,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,The exercises are inconsistent from day to day. Some days won't have some of the more difficult exercises then they'll be reintroduced with more reps making it difficult to complete. It is okay for daily use to break a sweat and burn some calories.,3
6453,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Please give 5 second gap after completing 1 exercise to prepare next exercise physically.,3
6454,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"The problem with the App is it doesn't reference or suggest other activies that are required to actually get a six pack. Just doing these exercises alone WILL NOT get you a six pack in 30 days! I think the exercises are fine and I'm starting to see results, but that's because I'm doing other things like fat burning exercises and dieting. You should include or reference these other things or provide a disclaimer..or change the name. Very misleading.",3
6455,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I followed it for more than 6 months...and I felt it doesn't apply to everyone...for many of us like me...some extra things like running, jogging, rope jump etc has to be done along with this exercise then only it works... I liked the variety of exercises I learnt from it",3
6456,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Great workout app, but very, very annoyed that you can't go back and review the summary of a singular workout nor can you delete a workout. I have like 5 rest days listed in my calendar for today. I tried to simply redo the workout, but that doesn't work either and now I have 2 more fake workouts with 4 and 90 calories burned today. Why is deleting a workout and not being able to review the singular after workout overview impossible? My progress is all screwed up now.",3
6457,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,It's a good app for working out but sometimes the reminders don't go off so I forget. And also I think It would be good if the voice would push you on but overall it's a good app,3
6458,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Mostly OK. Coach could be more upfront on tips for new exercises rather than telling you after you've nearly finished. Just started it and it threw me straight to Google play for another app, got back to the app and its telling me to do zero reps on exercise 17 of 15...",3
6459,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Great app which provides me with what exercise to do, keeps track of my BMI by provides (weight and height) and daily reminder. What i don't understand is why there is an ad for a different exercise app, it makes me think that this app is useless and telling me to move to the app that is advertised.",3
6460,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Really good app. The only thing I'd say is the pop-up ad blocks the main screen and restricts my view of the workouts. Can you also make the animated illustration a bit bigger? Otherwise it'd be a 5*,3
6461,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Just so everyone is aware, you can't target burn belly When you burn fat, you're burning it throughout your whole body. I'm going to give this a try, but not for getting a six pack, (because that's not possible without a good diet, maybe some cardio), but because I want the increase in core strength for my other lifts ;) and regardless of what the app promises, I just want the routine.",3
6462,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"great little app, though the volume and sheer annoyance of some of the ads kind of gets to you. like softly drifting to sleep, when suddenly a train horn sounds next to you.",3
6463,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Great workouts but the reminders.... It has taken the app 42 days to notify me that my last workout was 42 days ago. I set the app to remind me every 2 days. Sometimes you don't think it be like it is, but it do.",3
6464,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"How do I remove ads? I'd give it 5 stars if I could remove the ads. Is there a ""pro"" version I'm not finding? I've emailed twice over a 2 week period and have not heard back. Please, let me get rid of the ads like I was able to do with the stretching and home workout aps you guys built. I'll pay the 2.99 to do that.",3
6465,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Even though it is a free app..but the guide coach is embarrassingly irritating as she suddenly wakes up in the middle off the exercise and there seems to be a lag... kindly rectify to give guidance before and not in between exercises.,3
6466,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Started it today to go along with my diet I started three days ago it's simple, organized, and effective. Haven't been to a gym since the pandemic so the past year and a half I've let myself go so in thirty days hopefully I see results and I'll return to give it a new score based on my results.",3
6467,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I like the format, the pace, and the structure of this program. But, what type of people can burn their muscles to shreds and do it again the next day, or for 30 days straight? I couldn't do something like this when I was 20 years old, and I can't do it now. Why none of these apps spend a sentence mentioning recovery baffles me.",3
6468,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Only been using it a few days. It's very much a beginners app so far and I've been doing multiple workouts but the exercises are good.,3
6469,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,The rest times are really dumb. We don't need 30 seconds rest to switch between sides between two stretches. Yes you can skip but it's just an interruption to the workout.,3
6470,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"This app is pretty good. But I don't think if your a fat person you will have six pack abs that fast. Like I'm a six pack flaps. And I know this dosent make sense but I have seen no progress and I'm on day one. Like if your suppose to be a six pack abs in 30 days from a six pack flaps I think there should be progress each and every day. Well I hope that the name of this app is true by its name. Hopefully I have at most a view of abs or get a lot more skinny and and at least get rid of six pack flaps. Overall I think this is an excellent app, keep it up Leap Fitness Group!!!",3
6471,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I'm on day 5 and accidentally pressed day 28 rest twice. Now it's in my ""history"" and counts those trainings as ""done"". That's stupid. What's more, I can't delete them from my history! Please add the feature to remove them.",3
6472,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Can I speak to someone about this app please, preferably via email? Been using this every day.. not sure if it's giving me results yet so I'll get back in 30 days and let you know.. but this is better than the last one I had so fingers crossed! Really easy to follow and understand as well and always giving hints and tips which I love!",3
6473,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Good way to exercise, though somehow my progress has been reset.. yesterday was a normal training, today it's completely blank, no weight, no statistics, start from day 1, kinda disappointed after that, gonna continue using from day it cut, but still there is little sad",3
6474,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I will try to keep a progressive rating on this app. first day: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê I rate the first day right down the middle, due to it being so new to me. It is easy to navigate and understand. you can pair it with your Google fit app. that's it for now, see you in a bit.",3
6475,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"It's a good app, it didn't help me get abs though. I was eating healthy and drinking a lot of water while doing this, but I didn't gain any abs. It helped a lot with my weight loss, but abs probably requires to all 3 sessions. But still a pretty good app.",3
6476,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,This obviously won't really work as everyone knows: abs are made in the kitchen. I worked with this for 3 months and didn't get my sixpack abs because I started with too high of a bf%. It still built core strength but the original goal wasn't achievable with such an unpersonalized app.,3
6477,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Leg raises give me injury on my tailbone. I gave it a thumb down in app but keep appear in the next daily exercise. Can you change that so I can have another exercise. I think it would be best if we can make our own plan and exercises that suit our capacity.,3
6478,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"There are only a few progress after 30 days at intermediate level. And recently a small dot injury has appeared behind my back, I can't continue day 29 and day 30, then I have to stop practicing for few days.",3
6479,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,The only thing that makes it frustrating is when I accidentally click rest day option and even when I don't click finished it will assume all the days upto that day is done. It just ruins the whole record,3
6480,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,It is a very good app. I am 10 year old but i want to make six pack. I can fell my weight loosing. But the 2 stars are gone for ads and no diet plan. Otherwise this is a good app.,3

6488,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Great app. My only problem is what ever happened to the rest days??? In the update it states you can adjust the rest days. At least give us the options to set our rest days in the settings so we can keep track of our schedule. I swear us users have more sense than the devs,3
6489,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"You should be able to delete a workout. You should be able to do undo a finish on rest days too, just in case you clicked it by a mistake or you were just checking it out.",3
6490,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"This app is pretty good in terms of providing a good workout plan. However, the concept is flawed. If you want to get abs you shouldn't be working on abs every day! Your body needs about 2-3 days to synthesize muscle after a workout so working out before youve rested isnt great for results!",3
6491,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,It was good near the start but there are some really usless excerises in it. I even asked one of the personal trainers at my gym and he said that they were awful and usless exersises that don't help your abs and love handles at all.

6495,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"The exercises are alright, but it's really annoying when the voice gives you advice on how to do it and how to breathe AFTER you've done it, or you're already halfway through. I don't see how anyone approved that while making the app",3

6507,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,a good one but dont think that it will actually help u have 6 packs.i dont have any complaints related to glitches or quality .the workout is great too.but you need to understand that it is only for those who do not have an active life style or those who are slitly overweight.it will give u a flat belly but belive it is nearly impossible to have 6 packs by them.,3

6511,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Good app with decent excersizes but I recommend you get to a good level of fitness with a strong core before starting on the 90 day course, best results.",3
6512,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,A Good app for workout but sometimes you don't have the equipment necessary otherwise amazing. PS ads every beginning and end,3
6513,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Just did 30 days advance , no 6 packs but could feel the upper 2 packs , I will continue doing it again as it is useful but don't get your hopes high that you will get 6 packs within 1 month . It will take longer then that.",3
6514,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Will change my review on day 30. Only on day 2 so far, feel sore a good.I am a 17 year old just about to be a senior right after this summer ends. As you might have guessed I downloaded this app to get a six pack in 30 days, going to sick through until the end, fingers crossed that I get a six pack in 30 days. By the way day 0 I'm a skinny 17 1/2 year old.",3
6515,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,It's good but at latter stages you require a dumbbell which I do not have. It kinda makes the workout obsolete.,3
6516,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,was doing the workouts but the ads are horrible and it said because of my facebook these are the ads they choose but I don't have facebook so I uninstalled. great workouts tho,3
6517,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"The exercises are decent. Whether you actually get a six pack while following these workouts will also depend on your diet and body fat. Big issue with the app is the schedule. The exercises are intense and the time you spend working out grows. But the app tells you to work out THREE DAYS IN A ROW. Muscles need to recover. Your gains will be better if they do. The chance to get injured gets higher if you don't take breaks. Some reviewers comment they got injured, which comes as no surprise.",3
6518,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,If we say we don't like a workout and report it why is it not substituted from the lesson plan going forward? There needs to be a way to skip certain movements for those with certain mobility restraints.,3
6519,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Good workout guide. Way too many ads. I'd rather pay for an ad free app.,3
6520,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,It would be nice if you add few instructions about when to do these workouts and at what is the condition of the body at which the workouts would yeald good results and also add some don't s in the instructions.,3
6521,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,It's good the design is just ok but I like you guys to change the ui a little better and the ads are my biggest problem on this app so kindly remove the ads,3
6522,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"These workouts are rough even for beginners. But if you are consistent, you might not get a six pack in 30 days but more realistically in 90 days.",3
6523,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,The IOS version has a much better interface and graphics. The android version should not be any less..,3
6524,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I also used the lose the body fat app by this company. That ones better. I was able able adjust the stuff that was too easy,3
6525,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I have now started the exercise, and I am working on the belly, and I can feel pains on my belly. Let me finish with the exercise and I will come back again.",3
6526,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I think of that the app is the great for excersice but the theme or the design should be more attractive. This app is the boon to the excersice world.,3
6527,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Kept me doing at least some form of exercise for the last 90 days but I literally cannot see any visible change whatsoever!! I'm 5'10"" and weight 12'4 so not overweight, just some belly fat. Don't expect a flat stomach let alone a six pack without serious changes to your diet as well.",3
6528,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Extreme X awesome app really helps get in shape and it would be better if you made it harder you know for faster shaping,3
6529,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"If i write that i workout for 30 days as a beginner and nothing changed then you will say that reasonable diet is also necessary but how can i find a good diet plan.So, i will suggest you to add diet plan in this app!",3
6530,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"app is decent, but when they started forcing video ads I downgraded them, is not having an ad on every page enough, come on. moving on to something less obnoxious",3
6531,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,This exercising apps should have two different parts like easier exercises for people less than 18 years and a little hard for age group more than 18. Pls make changes and update the app as aboveüôèüôè,3
6532,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"The exercises are good , the app is excellent but for beginners its a hell ..... Its too diffcult for a person at start",3
6533,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,This is a good app with good exercises but they don't tell you that no matter how many ab workouts you do your changes won't be very visible. You have to diet to get ripped abs,3
6534,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I like the fact that It acts like a guide..You ideally don't need a gym instructor. Just discipline to commit to the work out.,3
6535,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Not good for working person. End of level 1 is too difficult for busy persons who are trying to lose weight.,3
6536,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,it's like 5 or 6 days since I started this app... But i like the workouts..I'm sure I'll get results then I'll rate it 5 stars.,3
6537,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Good exercises, but ads stopped closing. Means can't continue to exercise. Ads fine for free usage, but broken now. Moving on.",3
6538,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"great app, starting to get a six pack. only rating a 3 because the 'calories burnt' is so off. 300 calories in a 13 minute workout with 30 seconds rest between exercises? also they don't make it known, that diet is the most important thing to get a six pack",3
6539,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"App is good but i am not able to see the results till now. It's been 15 days since I am exercising, also I am dieting but then also no effects on my tummy. Please change the app name Leap Fitness Groupm",3
6540,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Ads are a bit more intrusive now, even when trying to exit the app. Kind of annoying really",3
6541,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I rate this 3 stars because it's a amazing workout app dont get me wrong but I tried all three of the different things you can do and I don't even have a four pack plz if your app is not going to give what it says dont say it will give someone that when you cant guarantee it FIX THIS NOW PLZ.,3
6542,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"While the exercises made me lose some fat and weight, the lose belly fat routine doesn't cut it. Some exercises are too painful for me. My abdomen has nearly unnoticeable change other than barely visible 2 pack. I'll look for other alternatives after I finish my final day",3
6543,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Can't wait to see how its gonna help me. But so far it is really convenient to have this app and turning it on every morning and feel my abs,3
6544,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,This is too easy i didn't even swet it just making people feel good with thenselves Edit: when there will be a new update??? And does the update is going to have extreme hard and faster workout?,3
6545,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I think this feature is really nice because there is total visible change with my abs as in I have lost a lot of weight so,3
6546,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Now first of all ANYTHING that gets you moving in this day and age is fantastic. Unfortunately this bodybuilding approach of isolating muscles to sculpt them has become mainstream. Bodybuilding workouts are for dedicated bodybuilders only. Everyone else should be doing full body workouts every day. The intensity should vary. For example: Mon, Wed, Fri - Workout Tue, Thu - Easy Swim Sat - Mobility Sun - Hike Best workout is Easy Strength by Dan John and Pavel for everyone but bodybuilders.",3
6547,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,It's a good app with a variety of exercises but why is there no 3 seconds countdown when you skip rest periods,3
6548,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Hi, can you pls help me understand how to use the app best? I started with intermediate and finished 11 days. 19 days left, but I haven't lost even half an inch - weight has also gone down by only 0.5kgs. I am also ensuring that I eat properly to not ruin it. I have a pot belly which does hurt after the exercises, but no visible change. Is there any other way to reach out to the community to clear these questions without spoling your rating?",3
6549,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Do you have an app that just has all your workout apps instead of installing a app for each one?? Ie. Abs, arms, stretch etc.",3
6550,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I would like it to be bilingual,3
6551,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,It's too good for home exercise,3
6552,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,There is a problem When U view a day in your training it shows an increase in number of workouts. And rest days are also added to number of workouts,3
6553,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I feel like I'm not changing. For some reason I keep doing this work out and the results haven't showed. Q. I'm healthy and I'm 15 years old doing this and I'm on day 10 on the medium. I doing the workouts correctly and I'm feeling burning feelings when I do the work out, what seems to be the problem? Hellpp",3
6554,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I just have problem with the app name, its imposible to have 6 pack in 30 days. When you say it could be happen, after 30 days the users get bad feelings.",3
6555,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Bought it. Its ok so far, Need to able to hear instructions through my music though. Most of the time voice is quiet",3
6556,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Bro it's extremely hard üò≠üò≠ but it is good for health,3
6557,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Good app but i unknowingly just removed the app from recents so i got the option to start from where i left but in overall results i doesn't count the workout i hv done before feels pathetic,3
6558,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Fantastic application with demonstrated exercise. BUT 30 days it's not enough to have six pack, you should do more and more, perhaps üíØ days",3
6559,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Everything is good but the exercise which I have disliked and submitted the reason as too hard is coming every day at least exchange the exercise because I am disliking it every day,3
6560,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Not a big difference. Slight improvement. Good for improving the abdomen shape but it will not give you six pack abs.,3
6561,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,If I can see changes in a month I would definitely rate 5 star,3
6562,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,It is great app for belly lose or for six pack i cut 2 star because u not make any description about diet plan ..... i suggest u to give diet plan with the exercise so the person can get result as u shown in the app with in 30 days .. i believe u work on my suggestion. Thank u for making good appü§óü§óü§ó,3
6563,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,It's good app . I started first 30 days workout plan . I see progress. I hope it stores data more efficiently,3
6564,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I loved it some are harded to do but i loved it,3
6565,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,The App is good but don't think you will get abs in 30 days you would also need to focus on your diet for that purpose acknowledge that developing abs will take time probably like 3-4 months,3
6566,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I would like the app to expand Its abs workout by splitting the different parts of the abs and working on one specific Area everyday.... Like for example work on External obliques, next day internal obliques, other day work on Rectus abdominis, another day work on transversus abdominis... Can this app Plz add these functions?üôè",3
6567,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,This is the best app that i ever seen before but the remainder can not alarms you if you want to do this activities twice per a day. üëçüëçüëç,3

6569,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Great app 15 days small six pack on 30 days full pack,3
6570,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Best app on The whole play store Its exercise were awsm but it shows wrong calories which burn during the exercises otherwise this is quite nyc app,3
6571,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Its very good App for abs i personally workout with the help of this app and now i have 4 abs really i do exercise only 17teen day at home.....,3
6572,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I used this app when I was younger and I don't know what sets and reps ment but the 30 day thing doesn't work cause it's called common since but it is good for learning abbs workout,3
6573,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Great workouts but the calorie count is way off. By more than double.,3
6574,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I'm doing more than what the beginner workout says, but then I can't input that, so the reports are off. I'm trying to lose weight, not go at this snail pace.",3
6575,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,What's with the push messages?!.... I'm doing it..... weird time etc... enjoying it otherwise!!!,3
6576,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Kinda easy even on the advanced setting and I'm a 13 year old girl,I would like them to make a harder app",3
6577,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I will give more stars if I get an ideal body, strong and sixpack! so far my practice in this application is very good a result",3
6578,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,The old version was best But today's version is worst At 20 th day the new version came and the exercises were very bad But it's a very good app,3
6579,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I just love the app It's a really good app for morning exercise . Today is my first day using it So let's wait nd see the results as soon I'll see the results I'll gave u more starts.,3
6580,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Wish the weight history report could zoom out so i could see progress over the last few months or year...,3
6581,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Good workout app . But downloaders should know you need to diet too in order to achive a 6 pack..... workouts are too long on last days :/,3
6582,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I tried this app for a week some time ago and gave up, i didnt give it the full 30 days so im trying it again now for 30 days, ill update after 30 days or when i finish, im on day 5 now",3
6583,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I just begin using this app and i love it because theres no ads. I'll update my rating after 30 days of workoutüòä,3
6584,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,nice app üëå all exercises are nice when was my first day exercises are difficult but some days after this exercises were easy,3
6585,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,does not give you six pack in 30days . I have been doing this for 60days and still no 6 pack.so keep. trying and maybe one day .but very great work out and cost nothing but your time .,3
6586,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,i have done the 'ROCK HARD ABS' thing for a month but have got no results....i have done all the exercises daily and properly but still i remain the same way i was....please tell me what should I do....,3
6587,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"The First Few days resulted in good ab burn but then I saw no changes and started gaining more fat. Plus, the excerises are also dangerous bc back pain can happen.",3
6588,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Very good app But pls add a three seconds time and bell ring before starting any workout whether or not started by skipping rest time for earlier exercise,3
6589,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I like the app worth the download... It really needs the ability to delete a single workout,3
6590,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Wonderfull app ...,....I think you should change the exercise daily because when I use it for days the workout becomes boring",3
6591,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Overall it's good.. but to many ads.. no option for remove ads..,3
6592,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Nice app but need to upgrade sign in feature so we can workout in different mobiles and progress will save in account,3
6593,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,This app opens up arbitrarily and seems to drain my battery horribly. as soon as I uninstalled it my battery life went up by 20%.,3
6594,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I am actually gonna commit to this and see if it work so I only gave 3 stars I will be back in a month to edit this review whether it works out or not basically if you see 5 stars this app has helped me with gaining abs.,3
6595,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Its a good app. I completed all 30 days for the Six Pack Abs routine without skipping a day or any exercises. As someone who already had decent abs before, u could see a noticable difference but it was not quite as defined as I was hoping. For more defined abs I would recommend doing more bar based exercises then floor based. This routine I created is going better for me: 250 sit ups 250 sit up twists 250 reverse crunches 100 25lb curls each arm 100 push ups 50 pull ups 20 Squats with 120lb Log",3
6596,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,It's good but sometimes idk the full action I need to take like I need to really look hard at the images to know what I need to do,3

6715,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,This obviously won't really work as everyone knows: abs are made in the kitchen. I worked with this for 3 months and didn't get my sixpack abs because I started with too high of a bf%. It still built core strength but the original goal wasn't achievable with such an unpersonalized app.,3

6798,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Nice üëç,3
6799,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Wow,3
6800,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I would appreciate if you could Taylor it more to toward what you are capable of. For example you could remove 1 heels to the heavens and replace it with 2 cobras. Just the ability to tweak it slightly. I understand that to target all muscle groups you should do them all, but a bit of customization would go a long way.",4
6801,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Needs to adjust ""The Next"" voiceover between each exercise - very annoying and doesn't even make sense. It seems this app was developed by a team with English and their second language. The workouts are great, and I've been using it for 2 years now. But please change the ""The next"" voice to the words ""Next Up..."" Crossarm crunches etc. Also, the shorts make it sometimes difficult to see what leg is being raised. Consider adding some shading to the inside leg to make the visual more obvious.",4
6802,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Really well built app. Unfortunately, I completed the first 30 days and am now 9 days in to to the second set of 30 days, and the exercises are much easier and quantities lower than they were at the end of the first 30 days. I feel like I'm losing progress. I wish moving on to the second set followed more linearly from the first set. I do like the daily reminders, the variety, and it's really easy (mentally) to just follow along with the workout.",4
6803,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Great for it being a free app. I am on day 23 of 30. The reminder helps a lot, it remind you every 20 hours to workout. The only issue with the app, is that the breaks (every 3 days), sometimes mess up the counts. Hard to explain but if you see break, don't even click on it and press finish or complete because it will disappear and it will throw off your schedule. Hopefully they fix that glitch.",4
6804,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Over all seems like a good app. The workouts are built to start easy and slowly build you up, but there are different levels so you can start harder, if you want. My biggest complaint is the reminders don't seem to work correctly. If I miss 1 workout, I don't receive any more notifications, even though I have it setup to remind me everyday.",4
6805,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Great app with some mild shortcomings. I went ahead and paid to get rid of the ads which appeared *every* time I would watch the videos which show how to do an exercise. The audio on the videos is annoyingly louder than the app audio. The app keeps track of which days you use it, yet it's not smart enough to know that if I skipped one or more days, I don't need the automatic day of rest. But the app has *definitely* helped my six pack. Now I just need to get below 13% body fat üòä.",4
6806,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"The workout is fun and challenging, even motivating as I can feel soaring in my core. My only and big complaint is that this app has a loud tik-tok sound for anything with time (both in-between break and workout). I listen to music or podcasts when I work out, and that tik-tok sound is not pleasant and even distracting. The only option to turn it off is to completely mute the guide, but I also prefer to have time warning and coaching tip for better workout, so it's not the smartest audio set up.",4
6807,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Really great app. Can't believe it is free. The only thing I would change is to let the user change the reps of individual exercises instead of a generic make easier or make difficult setting. Sometimes there is only one exercise I struggle with and it would be nice to lower the reps of that one exercise instead of a revision of the whole program.,4
6808,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I wasn't expecting much from this app, but I needed a workout plan and a constant reminder to work out. So I downloaded the app. I am happy to say, this app is honestly AWESOME. It sends u a notification every day and the workouts are simple, well explained, and encouraging. I have seen a lot of progress and I have abs despite being only 2 months in. The one thing though is that you aren't going to actually get abs unless you also change your daily excercise and eating habits. Awesome nonetheles",4
6809,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"the app is an awesome tool if your ready to get abs but dont know where to start, the coach speaks clearly and also gives you tips ( its almost like shes watching you) and you can adjust the intensity of the workout. my only complaint is there is too much rest time that i need to skip it. I should be able to adjust rest time in settings (instead of 30 seconds, 15 for each excercize) the app overall should be more adjustable",4
6810,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Finished the 30 days beginner. It has had some results already. I am starting on the intermediate shortly, but the apps stretches are inadequate. The Cobra stretch is just painful on my lower back, but beyond that it lacks any stretching that isn't your core. Some are needed for things like leg raises. It's a good app, it's just lacking some things.",4
6811,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"The design looks like it's for frat boys but the exercises are very well put-together, the presentation is very good, & the overall program is very doable. I'd like to adjust the days off because I have other training commitments. If I open one of the future days just to look at it, it shows up on my calendar as something I've done. They should tone down the male model images. We can rate each exercise but there's no response in terms of the routines being adjusted according to ratings",4
6812,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"This is a very good app. Only one thing wrong with it. During the middle of an exercise, when you are trying to count the number of reps you're doing, the computer voice will say sth totally useless and break your counting concentration. It's ok during timed exercises, but she should shut up when your trying to count. Otherwise, no complaints and helpful app.",4
6813,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"if your unexperienced at working out this app for you. If a exersise is confusing to you can touch the ? button or the exersise itself on the list. I found myself needing more info on a few but there is a video button for a actual person doing the exercise if the gif image dont help. The cons are the ads. its not a little bit, every time you click on the video you get a ad. everytime before and after a set its a ad and it gets very repetitive real quick. They last 30 second each. 4 stars.",4
6814,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"App is very good tips 1. Eat the same as before in the beginning but then slowly reduce into more healthy and keep going. (abs are 80 precent diet):( 2. if day 9 is difficult keep doing that for a couple of days until you are the boss the idea is to push yourself, not kill yourself 3. Cheat day is good. 4. you will see improvement in 30 days not abs 5. play music in background of the app and keep it going. i don't like head phones, always worried when my gadget will fall and i well step on",4
6815,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Everything is great but I have one tiny suggestion that would make this review a 5 star review: allow for moderate customization of workouts. For example, if you want to plank for 2 minutes instead of 1 minute, you can do so. Or if you want to substitute the regular crunches with more reverse crunches, etc. Just stuff like that would be the icing on the cake, and honestly it's already a 5 star app, but I'm hoping this is seen so it can be implemented.",4
6816,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Great workout routines and set up. Annoyed by the robot voice. Would like to hear a real motivational voice in the human language. Almost dropped my rating down 1 star because of that. Would jump to a competitor app if they supplied that option and comparable to this app. Please attempt a real voice, not robot, it's hard to follow a robot's voice!",4
6817,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Overall, this is a good fitness app with a nice routine. However, it is not as thoughtfully designed as the dumbbell exercise app by the same developer in terms of rest time. The dumbbell app does a good job making rest time shorter for easier moves and stretches. In this app, every exercise gets 30 second break even when you're just going into a stretch that does not need 30 seconds rest. Other than that, I enjoy it!",4
6818,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Awesome home workouts. I'd give it 5 stars, but not all of their exercises target muscles, some are more for stretching. I stretch before working out, so some of the exercises could be replaced with more intense ones, however, this app teaches you so many exercises that you could make your own set of exercises from what you've learned.",4
6819,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"overall its a pretty good program, though I wish there was the ability to auto complete exercises. I like to run without my phone and do these exercises halfway through my run and coming home and having to click through the entire workout can be a bit annoying. I also love all the other Leap Fitness Group's apps, but I WISH they'd put them all in one convenient app. I understand why they don't (ads for 6 apps better than 1) but man I'd be more likely to use that rather than 3-4 of the ""same"" app",4
6820,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I really love this app and all it has to offer. I've been seeing a difference in my strength and endurance already. The only thing that I would change is there is a move that I have trouble doing due to my carpal tunnel and I wish there was a way you could replace a move in your routine with a move that works the same muscles so I could work around my particular injury. I feel other people would enjoy this option as well. Otherwise great job!,4
6821,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Really like this app. My only problem with it is its impossible to workout towards a 6 pack. The only way to get a six pack is through dieting, intermittent fasting being the most effective. Good selection of exercises and simple system would have given it 5 stars if they avidly pushed dieting being an important part of getting a six pack.",4
6822,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Seeing results for the first time in my life, it's fantastic. and there isnt a bombardment of ads or a faulty calorie tracker!!! Youll never get six pack abs from any app unless you bring your body fat level to extreme lows but if you're in decent shape you will see your muscles shaping once you follow this daily schedule. the last month is pretty difficult in my opinion tho so be weary. it took me nearly double the amount of time but I guess it's good having more challenging workouts ahead.",4
6823,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Great app, many workouts and video explanations uf something isn't quite clear. The Ads are non disruptive. Would be great if exercises could be put in a ""do not use"" list (because some I simply didn't get right and I rather wont do it anymore than doing it wrong)",4
6824,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,4 star since the name of the app is misleading. I was a total novice at working out with an average build. Maybe it is possible to get abs in 30days but with the right diet. (careful calorie intake),4
6825,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Good idea, very nice and useful app without extra unnecessary things. But the intermediate level is too easy",4
6826,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Keeps your metabolism working well. But don't expect to lose your belly in 30 days, unless you aid the app with diet and jogging.",4
6827,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Pretty good app, you can tailor your exercises to your desired difficulty, love that the exercises vary, I changed my difficulty to get better/difficult exercises that didn't strain my neck so much (basic crunches always hurt my neck), definitely an ab burner, worth a try!",4
6828,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,It was truly an amazing experience. im probably not going to get a six-pack in thirty days üòÖ but I feel fitter and stronger!,4
6829,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,It good and it has good exercise.but on my view I think it should have some music while exercise,4
6830,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Self guided no nonsense workout. Great when you have limited time to get in a workout without a gym or equipment,4
6831,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Would be nice to have the ability to adjust the individual exercises - set the repetition count or chose an alternative exercise. Also, when completing one level (beginner for instance) the next level should start at the same difficulty level where it was left. I found that starting the advanced level was way easier than the last sessions of the beginner.",4
6832,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I'm seeing major results in just a few days! Easy and clean interface, and the animations for each exercise are a nice touch. I like the idea of a voice coach, but the robot voice is a bit off-putting. The ticking of the clock would also be more appropriate for the last 10 seconds or so, rather than the whole exercise/rest. Otherwise great app!",4
6833,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"There's no chance I'll get a six pack in 30 days, but I like the app a lot - it's a good, quick work,out I can do every morning.",4
6834,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Great simple app for getting fit. I love the number and duration of exercises. Hoping to hit my target!!,4
6835,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I have payed to remove ads because of how much I like this app. You don't need to at all as they aren't invasive but as a token of my appreciation I payed for no ads. Would highly recommend.,4
6836,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Nice app I will edit this text if something different happens cus so far this is a pretty good app I just started and I am sweating quite a lot.,4
6837,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I started on the easier ""weight loss"" mode, even though I'm slim already, because I have little strength. So far it's been mildly challenging, but simple and short enough to stick with. During exercises some tips get announced which you might miss, which is frustrating, and during the breaks, if you want to read on how to perform the exercise, the clock pauses, which isn't ideal, but not a deal breaker either. Just start using the app as soon as you download it, don't let it ""rest on the shelf""",4
6838,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Ive done the 30 days. Did it give me sick abs? No. Of course not. I'm even on a higher difficulty. You can't expect that though. Have I noticed a difference? small if any. Gains take time and dedication and this app makes it easy to do just that. It has a calendar, built in weight tracking, personalized workout routines and difficulties. There's a 3 tier system, one for each month. 3 months total. I'll continue to the the last tier for another month. this app is worth it if you want to get fit",4
6839,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Great app, good for home exercises with limit gym equipment. It targets the required abs. I love it.",4
6840,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"So far so good. Love the transitions. Only on day3 but looking forward to the end then im sure I'll love my progress. You Have to compliment this, as with any workout program, with good sleep and nutrition to get optimal results. Really feel like im starting to recruit those lower muscle fibres back again as im using this program as a guide and on screen motivation to get back into my fitness routine.",4
6841,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Okay this app works, the workouts are good at activating the muscles groups and the variety is not bad, plus the animation and videos are awesome. The only issue that I had with it is the progression, it started adding more reps to each workout without increasing the load or without modifying the workout to be harder and shorter, I believe if they lessened the reps and changed the advanced workouts to be a little bit harder it would make the workouts better and waaay shorter.",4
6842,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"There is no middle ground with this app, you'll either love it or you'll be disappointed. Now it is naive to think that without changing anything about diet and doing a 5 minute workout everyday will get you a six-pack, it's illogical and you're setting yourself up for disappointment. However the app is good for staying in shape, having a more organised routine and better mood and energy. It's been good, and best I can put for people who want six pack is that the app can be part of the process",4
6843,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,My opinion was about give this app 5 star ‚≠ê but during my excercise time the ads was generateing it disturbed my excercise time limit so from mine side I make humble request to company that reduce the ads please üôè,4
6844,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"This is my first day using this app, and I like it a lot so far.bthere are three different levels on how intense you want your workout to be, which I really appreciate. It tells you how many excersises there are, provides a tracker, reminder, and calendar, and a voice coach. However, the reason I rated it 4 stars and not 5 is because the voice trainer's automated voice gets kind of annoying after a while. If it were replaced with a real person's voice, I would definitely rate 5 stars. Thx guys!",4
6845,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,it si good you can choose different types of exercise you want to do like for losing weight or making a 6 pack but its kind of difficult because it shows what you have to do only with animated pitcures which sometimes the animation is difficult to understand.Some upgrades should be about diet where it tells you what should you eat.but its still really good.,4
6846,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Pretty effective program so far. You should start seeing visible improvement after around a week. The only issue I have had with it is that when i check the upcoming days simply opening the tab for the rest days logs them as complete so when those days actually come around I can't properly log them and it leaves gaps in the log which is a little annoying,4
6847,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I love the app! I've been using it for two weeks and I feell a lot better and see noticeble change. The only thing that needs fixing is the animation for slow mountain climber. It's not possible to move both of your legs at the same time while doing it!,4
6848,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Helps. Simple ui but i have a problem. I cant turn off the seconds ticking sound without muting all the voices and coach advices, it's annoying as i listen to music while working out and the ticking sound is annoying and interrupts the music too",4
6849,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Seems useful you can set a reminder with the app. Is easier than I expected. I think that the Advanced program is probably quite doable as the Intermediate was too easy for me and I haven't done ab workouts in awhile.,4
6850,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Good app I recommend adding a feature that shows which parts of the bodies are affected by the specific excersise,4
6851,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"First day went pretty smoothly, I just needed to replace one exercise with standing one, due to my back problems.",4
6852,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Overall this is a great tool, I don't have a 6-pack but didn't expect to since i didn't do much to reduce fat. It's a nice challenge to change up your regular fitness regimen for a month. I think it over estimates calories burned a bit. The other languages count in the chosen language but use English terms with bad accents for the non-numeric aspects.",4
6853,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I love the app, definitely got abs starting from a gut. Admittedly, if you want to see the results advertised in the 30 day period, you should ALSO be mixing in some heavy running, weight lifting, and a clean diet... Also, I really wish there was a way to customize the workouts more to maybe mix the types in each plan up and stuff. Either way, it's good stuff, the tips on form are nice!",4
6854,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Works but wont give you a 6 pack in 90 days. The app is split into 3 sections. Towards the end of each section the amount of time to do each excercise increase to the point it takes 45 mins everyday... which is too long. This app needs to be done in addition to other fitness not instead of. But it did take me 110 days in the end to do the 90 days as its soo time consuming on some workouts. I dont have a 6 pack but i do now have significant strength in my core and my body is more toned. Worth it.,4
6855,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Instructions in English is very difficult to understand for maximum Indians. Please update instructions in between exercise with Hindi language so we Indians can do better.,4
6856,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"One ad before starting and another after you finish. No interruptions in between. 2021 Update: Been using the app for almost two years now along with a bicep training version from the same developers. I'm afraid to say it held well, but it is time to move on to other apps that feature bodyweight training but with more compound exercises built in it.",4
6857,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Great way to excersize and keep active. When you press the coffee cup to have a rest day it automatically counts the rest day. Like I said before, it is a great way to keep active. The results turn out clear and there is a motivating quote saying that even a little progress is still progress. Great app to use.",4
6858,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,The exercises are good enough and designed very well for each level according to a person's need and fitness level at which he already is. It also has calorie tracker and can show your BMI index which is a good feature.I would have rated it 5 stars if it also had a nutrition guidance for an individual throughout the day according to his/her need,4
6859,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I have completed the 90 day program of this service and I must say I was able to see pretty much some abs but the day still remained. I didn't comply with any diet plans but still I was able to see some parts of my abs which I had never been able to see before. The animations in the application are good and the app had been consistently improving.,4
6860,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Just finished my first workout. I'm impressed. I love the way it works, and the design. I think a cool thing to add would be to make the voice be a bit more encouraging. (Or for me a little bit of constructive criticism such as; GO faster! WHY are you going slow! Push,Push!) But, other than that, decent app. I rated it 4 stars because I haven't finished the 30 days of losing belly fat. But when I do, I will check back.",4
6861,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Very good app... I used it for a couple weeks and it really helped to develop my abs..üòâ I'm giving it 4 stars because i can't adjust the difficulty levels sometimes and it is a bit slow, i mean the automated voice..there also should be be more advicing during the workout sessions..üòí",4
6862,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Great exercises, different voice coach sounds. Great App! Cons - after the last exercise is over, there is an ad. Dont mind the ad, but if you are using ear pieces, the sound of the voice coach is normal sound and the ad is a very loud sound. That's very irritaing, else I would've given 5*",4
6863,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I have been using this app for a while now and have no major problems with it. But there are couple of things. First I liked when you exercise every and have a day off every four days that shows as breakday. Some little things here and there are different with new update. And most important thing. And thats for developers of this app. Please please can you have an option for making a custom exercise list of individual selection please. I can't perform some do to injury or need more out of it. Tx,4
6864,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I like how if you can't understand the exercise through the animation, you can automatically see a video from YouTube, but the only problem it has is that you can't reset a timer in the middle of the excorsise, so you need to set a different timer or count it out overall I am happy I installed it",4
6865,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"The app shows that I burnt 350 kcal or more or little bit less. But in my smart watch, it only shows that i burnt 20-30 kcal only. Maybe i am doing the excercide in a wrong way but i dont think so since i know i am doing it the right way.",4
6866,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Awesome app!! Shows you your progress as you work out each day. Set reminders for your next workout plans. And it's totally free. Sure you get some ads, but nothing that will interfere with your workout. You can also download the other 30 days workout apps that are also as great as this one, and are also free! Only improment I would add is to incorporate a diet plan that would relate to each exercise group. That would without a doubt give this app a 5 star all around.",4
6867,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,After 3 months I feel like a new person I did see results but because I was not doing exercises correctly I did lose some progress I have seen my abdominal muscles get stronger and can feel them but there is a layer of fat so I would recommend if you have the right equipment but I do want to suggest that me not doing the exercises correctly was because sometimes the video would show the same exercise with a small different so I didn't know which was the right one so many more context,4
6868,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"It's good for abs, would love to see same app for whole body workout. The only problem is some of the exercises are way too easy even on hardest difficulty and selecting i want some exercises to be much more harder.",4
6869,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Good, but IMO doesn't 100% remove the needs for a spotter or PT: training with improper techniques could be worse than doing nothing at all. One simple feedback. Please make sure that ALL activities with alternating sides are clearly indicated with the number of total reps and reps per side. Sit up twists, for example, is missing the number of reps per side, making the rep count instruction confusing.",4
6870,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,This app is great for workout at home. Love it. Interface is also very easy to use and ads are shown before or after workout session is complete no disturbance in between. Just a request add a bmi calculator separately for calculating bmi of others so that is does not disturb our session. Otherwise this app is very good.,4
6871,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Was a bit unmotivated at first, but I'm going to try to tether the app to a specific month and that made it easier to start. Just wish each exercise gave you like a 3 second buffer if you skip the rest periods, the timer starts right away and I have to get back into position so I feel like I missed a bit.",4
6872,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Doing exercises with this app for last 6 days. This app is very cool. One feature we want is the voice control. It will be nice, if after finishing on exercise, we can complete the exercise through the voice, not by tapping on the button.",4
6873,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"The ads kind of take over the phone and mess with the volume on podcasts or music until you close them out. But if that's the only price for a free service I'll gladly pay it. So i would highly recommend this app. I'm not one who generally rates apps or gives feedback, but i felt this was high enough quality to warrant a positive review.",4
6874,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Love the app, would love if you added a spartan workout mode. WIsh you could adjust the rest in between workouts and start countdown timer, also the adjustment needs to be grayed out to know what level you selected.",4
6875,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,The ads are very minimum which you can skipüò≥why can't all apps be like this. If I see an ad first 2seconds I can decide to watch or skip. The abs are not there lol but the belly is definitely smaller than before. I'm not sure if I can repeat again because definitely I can't go to the difficulty which is too hard,4
6876,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"The only criticism I have is the length of workouts. They can be from 11 - 26. Anything over 15 is unnecessary and time consuming. However, the app actually works pretty well. These guys from Leap Fitness Group have some great workouts. If you're missing the gym during lockdown, these apps are just perfect. However, I would strongly recommend you don't do more than one app per day. I have downloaded 3, so you can do them over 3 - 4 days which is all you need.",4
6877,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"fantastic, I've seen the changes straight away and the reaults are astonishing. could do with something to insure that the user sticks to the times and stays dedicated. I just dont like the extensive use of ads consistently that block my progress or slows me down.",4
6878,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I am in my 7th. Day using the app and I would give higher rating but. I deleted my 1st 3 days of data but in the calendar and history it is still there. I'm keeping my rating till the development is corrected. Never gave some one a pre rating hoping they would improve. The exercises are very good,4
6879,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Easy to follow, videos are pretty clear. I just wish that proper breathing techniques were described under each position/movement. The audio will tell you sometimes but it's hard to remember them all, especially when you are starting.",4
6880,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I love the App. The exercises steadily progress with you as you progress on your endurance. It is well thought through. The warm ups, exercises, stretches and days off.. Amazing. I'd give it a 5 star rating. Just felt like giving it 4üòÖ.",4
6881,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Was doing good. Easy to use and good exercises. No six pack yet but feeling a bit fitter. Then halfway through the intermediate level and the app just disappeared from my phone. Lost all my data, dates, calories etc. Just going to start again from where I left off. Bit of a pain but hey.",4
6882,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Does exactly as it says. Works the abs hard at different levels. It does get easier as you progress. The only downside are the ads being pushed onto my screen. Otherwise it has to be 5 stars.,4
6883,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"A great way to keep track of core exercises, and while the 30 day time frame is a bit unrealistic, it's still a great app. One thing I would like to see is a fourth month of more challenging exercises that help maintain core strength- repeating the last 10 days of month 3 works but likely isnt viable in the long run.",4
6884,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"This app is brilliant, it is pretty much all you can ask for in a free exercise app. One thing for the fifth star though; can you make it stop my phone from sleeping when mirroring the screen to the TV? Currently I have to unlock my phone after each exercise which is trivial but annoying.",4
6885,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Great workouts. Ive done the intermediate and in the middle of the advanced, but seem to look the same. Still have that stubborn belly. There are some I jus cannot do so I modify them. The ticking countdown makes the timed exercises feel longer than they are.",4
6886,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Have done this with all 3 sets before and found it great to do. I left doing this for 9 months or so. But need to get my abs back in shape, so started doing it again. The image description this time round has improved. It would be good to have a breathe in / out prompt.",4
6887,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Although I'll say this app has a lot of the necessary exercises required to get abs, it doesn't actually guarantee you getting abs in those 30 days. Which is quite annoying. I think it'll be nice if you guys add a sort of dieting schedule to the routine so the results would be better shown",4
6888,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,It takes not even a week to show the result. It showed slight changes in my body from day 4-5 itself. It really works. I will reccommend this app for u. But i was not able to complete the full 30 day course due to health issues. After doing this exercises i fell ill thrice for many days . I don't know why. So i decided to leave this course. I will again restart this course after some months. And also thanks for making such an excellent app. I gave 4 stars b cuz i fell ill for a very long time,4
6889,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,It's a good app. However I really hate the clicks of seconds and there is no option to turn it off. Why would anyone want to listen to clicks between the exercises? Just make the last 3 seconds audible and I will increase my rating.,4
6890,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Really nice app, on day 11 right now and i have had no problens with it, the fact that there arent any ads during the workout is amazing, and theres lots of information it displays, records workouts on calendar and just an overall user intuitive and user friendly experience with this app. Let's see what i have to say at day 30 tho fingers crossed.",4
6891,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"The title is misleading, but it's still a good app for a routine workout. I've gone back and forth between apps to create a structured workout routine. This one seems to be the best. It teaches you how to do the exercises, allows for breaks in between, and is extremely dynamic to fit one's needs.",4
6892,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I did the middle and last program(mostly all the way besides few days). At first it was pretty good length but near the end it takes 17+ minutes, and I did not do the rest in between the exercises. I did notice a difference in my abs throughout the program. My only gripe is I wish it was more difficult but shorter as my abs never really got tested where as I have a 5-6 min program that makes you want to quit.",4
6893,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I have been using this app for about 2 mouths . It's so good and challenging . But I think that there are some exercises that are too hard to do , or maybe that I'm not flexible enough to do them . So , it would be great if you add the option to delete or replace the exercise that we found too hard to do with another one .",4
6894,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Good app bro I cried it and I loved it. But there is a tiny problem I because I couldn't exactly do the right and left leg swing and the heels of heavens too when I tried the video it uses the data you should solve that problem so we can watch it without data. Hay there's something else I think some of these are too extreme because I couldn't barely walk the first time I cried them. But any it's a good app especially because the gym is close I'm only 13 years but I like it,4
6895,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Very easy to use and no set up required. There are videos and animations of all excersizes and the timer audibly count down. It also has easier options if necessary and adjustable rest time. Overall great for a daily workout,4
6896,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Can we please have an option of watching the human video demo for the next exercise while rest time, some exercises I were doin had incorrect form and nit all animations were clrar. and its hassle to skip then pause the timer sometimes. Use miss a few seconds and the momentum gets paused. Overall really good app.",4
6897,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I have done the beginner section and am 2/3 through the intermediate section. There are options to thumb up or down an exercise and you are able to explain why you thumb them down (injury, inexperience, etc) but you never see them less, so why bother? Ads are fine, only get one and it's skippable after a few seconds. Great for getting on a schedule, there are even planned rest days. Other reviews said this wouldn't actually give you a six pack in a month, and I didn't even expect that.",4
6898,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,The best workout experience I've had... And because of this app I've stopped going to the gym as I've experienced the app is enough for your goals along with self motivation Edit: I have been using the app so frequently and since a long time and I'm addicted to it. One thing missing is the partner integration with Strava. Strava has been very important app for so many people now a days and they have partnered with multiple apps. You guys should also look into it.,4
6899,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,This is a great experience to me because i think i needed this exercise and even though it hearts to do the exercise it gives us some tips . For example they say if its too hard then you can do something easier. But if its too easy they give us an option on if we want to make it harder. And i really like this. Even though im on day 3 i really love this experience .,4

Otherwise, the tips that she mentions are perfectly aligned when I feel my posture is incorrect! Great app team! üëèüèΩ",5
7002,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Good for people with limited time. I wanted an exercise routine that I can actually stick with which means needed to be doable within a short amount of time (I can do the program within 15-20 minutes/day), be customizable (app differentiates between beginner, intermediate and advanced and gives the option to adjust within that too--great), and well explained to get the right effect and prevent injury (apps has well-made short videos for each exercise). Good value overall.",5
7003,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I have discovered muscles using this app that I never knew where there. It is instructional, challenging, flexible, efficient and gets results. Highly recommend for those wanting to workout at home but still useful in a gym routine (when we get out again). It keeps a limited diary and the user's goals are structured. The ads are not obnoxious and well placed so I actually read them! My only complaint is that I can't get it to share data with my Fitbit.",5
7004,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I haven't had a ton of experience with work out apps. This app is the second work out app I've tried. But I thoroughly enjoy it! It's simple, easy to use, it has 3 different goal oriented work out programs to choose from and the exercises feel appropriate for the different work out programs. The explanations/examples of each exercise is great and helpful. And there are some easy to use and helpful features as well. I haven't explored all the features yet tho. But I recommend giving it a try!",5
7005,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Great workout that doesn't require equipment and has instructional videos available for each exercise. It's perfect to squeeze in to a short ten-minute time slot during the day. I really appreciate the variety on each day's exercises so they don't get boring, and the subtle scale-up. And if the scaling is too subtle, you have the option to increase (or decrease) the difficulty each day.",5
7006,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Great for all levels. If you don't know where to begin, this app walks you through. If you're experienced/expert, then you know what variation of the exercises you can do. It's simple. Some exercises give users variations of the exercise. One thing I wish it had was the ability to choose your rest time. I end up just skipping, but would like if I could just choose a shorter/longer time.",5
7007,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I really love this app the workouts are simplified and are customized to your fitness level. I hate feeling exhausted after a workout. The workouts in this app are not too strenuous and are just perfect. Also dislike doing the same workouts over and over again. The workouts in the app varies each day and makes it more fun and not feel routine. Absolutely love the app, the developers did a excellent job on this. Props to the development team. üòé üòÅ üôÉ",5
7008,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"This app is wonderful. It's free, which is wonderful right off the bat. And the service it provides doesn't feel like something you'd get from a free app. First off, the work outs are chosen very well, clearly explained, and easily modified to be easier or harder. Second, yes, there are ads, but they are non-intrusive and only about 30 seconds max. Third of all, the progress made is clearly shown. I am doing the intermediate level work out and only after a week in I see progress",5
7009,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I hate reviewing stuff. It just isn't my thing, however this app is amazing. It is free so commercials/ads come with it, but they aren't overbearing. Moreover, they proceed at the end of the workout! Also, if you want more you tell the program to challenge you more and it does at a fair increment instead of 100%. Thus, it supplies a little more for you, which you feel, instead forcing you to take back the gain you want because it was too much of an increase. This is perfect!",5
7010,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Great progression. Starts easy and asks at the end of the workout how it was so it can taylor your next workout for you. Quick workout, so it's easy to fit into a busy schedule. No extra equipment needed. Good variety, so I'm not doing the same boring thing everyday. So far, I've been motivated to stay with it. Ads are minimal and at beginning or end and aren't disruptive or annoying. I'm downloading another app by the same developer because I like this one so much. Nice job!",5
7011,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I used this app off and on for a year during covid with decent but inconsistent results due to lack of consistent use. I then committed on July 27th to complete the full 90 day program, 30 days of each level. As of today 11/11, I have lost 13 lbs and feel incredible, more fit than I've felt in years, a much stronger core than I had ever imagined. The exercise, reminders and records are very motivating and keep me looking forward to the next day. This app is a life changer of you stick to it.",5
7012,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I have been using the app for almost two years.. i have completed the second level twice during that time. I come back to it too improve my form over the prior time. It is a progressive and sets a thirty day program that is easy to stick with. If you have been wanting to get your core in shape (i have back issues and this has definitely helped) this is a great tool. I will admit that the ""six pack in thirty days"" description is a little misleading. None the less... Totally Worth it!!!",5
7013,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"This really works! Level 3 is really challenging and fun. After finishing level 3 the first time, I am starting to see the 6 pack forming. Another month of level 3 and my abs will definitely be ripped. Love the instructions and reminders of proper form and breathing during the sets, and the stretching at the end. And finally, the ads are reasonable and not at all intrusive.",5
7014,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I'm halfway through my first 30 days. mildly surprised that I've mostly stuck with it and have found the diverse exercises very useful. I've tended to have decent abdominal health but never truly 'in shape.' This app has helped. First, they scale up in difficulty as you begin the exercises. Your standard workout is 10-15 minutes with breaks. At the end I was surprised, I felt the workout but wasn't exhausted. I survived skipping a few days during the holidays and the app reminded me. Helpful.",5
7015,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"One week in and pretty impressed so far. I'm relatively in shape and this took my normal ab routine and expanded it. Like the different levels of difficulty a lot. But keep in mind. If you are very over weight or have a huge gut, the results won't be as definitive. I'm very active and find the highest level of this to be above average in terms of challenge. App is well laid out and the animations are great. This is pretty much an animated ab hiit circuit. All in all, fantastic.",5
7016,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Great thus far, I use it, my nephew and a few others I know. The app works great, very easy to follow and easy to adapt. I like the option of skipping through the rest points or even an exercise if its too difficult. Of course you can't literally get a 6 pack in 30 days but it will definitely start to show. Just keep using the app and depending on your starting point, within 60 days you'll definitely see results; either smaller waist/less belly fat or see major muscles poking their way through.",5
7017,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"This app is excellent. #1 it's free #2 ads are skipable #3 workouts are adjustable, so you can make them easier or harder continuesly.. do all three levels then start over making them harder and harder to do just keep doing it for ever. Excellent way to keep track of workouts and weight, reminders and all. I would recommend this app, just do it stick with it and you will be happy with the results.",5
7018,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Easy to use app, very good instructions! I just began using the app. The workouts seem to mainly work my core and hopefully help to trim up, get mire muscle definition, and lose some weight. The animation showing the various exercises is very clear and helpful. Each exercise is either timed or you are told how many repetitions to do. You are given a 30-second rest between exercises. Very well done!",5
7019,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"This app and dedication and trust me, you'll have progress. The app has a notification-based reminder feature that I find very helpful, and I love the act that it has exercises with and without equipment for anyone's preference and/or needs. Maybe the computers voice could be changed to be more inspirational or something but that's just me being picky the app itself is great and fulfills it's purpose perfectly üíØ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•üí™",5
7020,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I'm pretty athletic, but you know, Covid-19 messed up a lot of athletes. Anyways, I've wanted to try this app for awhile, but I just never got around to it. But after around 15 days on the advanced level, I feel stronger. I'm not sure if my abdominals are visually changing, but I'm not done with the 30 days yet, and will likely do the program again with less rest days. Overall a great app, easy to follow, and really encouraging!",5
7021,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I am just a kid wanting to work on my body for the future. Though some of the wokouts on advanced are pretty hard i'm getting by just fine. I really love how it shows animations, showing you how to do the workout, also how it reminds me when to do my workout at a specific time that you choose. I really love this app and i've seen other reviews talking about hw their ads are a problem but not for me yet (hopefully). But overall it is a really good easy to use app.",5
7022,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Excellent overall. I've done it off-and-on for months. I'll review it again with results once I go through one of the programs start-to-finish in thirty days. edit: I completed the rock-hard abs workout from start-to-finish in a 30 day span, and I can confirm: I now have a six pack! It actually started to show up 22 days in, and then started to gain more definition over tye last week or so. This is a fantastic app.",5
7023,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"So ive tried this app and it gives time and reminders for a capable, everyday workout. It does have ads but personally speaking its a small price to pay to just take 5 seconds to press the ""x"" button on those ads. Compared to the time of other workouts which have little to no ads and just a simple system in which they compromise the screen size with an ad, while being able to look at the screen with little annoyance. So far this is a free app, with the paid version being to just take off the ads.",5
7024,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Only on day 7 and seeing results. Super good workout and if you cant/dont feel comfortable in the gym but looking to lose weight, this is the perfect app to start. No workout equipment needed besides your own weight. And there's coaching voices for when you feel like giving up, it's a good motivator. Definitely worth downloading. But you have to stick to it to see results!!!",5
7025,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"challenging snd and free to use. Some of the exercises are the devil and don't see possible (I'm look at you ""V-up"" you bastard), but perhaps as progress through the challenge it'll become easier. The animated examples are easy to follow and the links to youtube videos are a nice touch if you want to see a human demonstrate the exercise. It syncs to Google Fit and tracks weight. So far, the app is been great. Ads are there, but annoying at all.",5
7026,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I started using this app because I gained a lot of weight (about 30 pounds in 4 months) due to working remotely and a sedentary, overeating lifestyle. I give full credit to this app, about 30 minutes of walking/day, and a more balanced diet for having lost 11 pounds in 30 days and an inch and a half of belly fat so far. The exercises are adjustable to your needs, easy to learn, & the right balance between challenging & doable. I restarted the beginner's track and plan to go to the next levels",5
7027,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"In combination with aerobic activity and changing eating habits, I've found this app to provide incredible benefits. I've lost 20 pounds over a month, and clearly can see the start of a 6 pack. Although I need more work, the exercises are clearly easy to use and navigate thru. I do not have issues with pop ups during any routine. I will continue to use, as being 50 and in shape is an awesome thing.",5
7028,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Exactly what's needed. Perfect balance of features and feedback, and great guidance on the exercises. There are a few exercises I'd never tried before and the animations and video make it easy. The voice prompts are instructive and timely without being annoying. Minor issue is it's really hard to tell front from back leg and arm on some animations; could use stronger color diffs.",5
7029,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I took the advanced course and it was great! It challenged me to my limit, especially when I chose to skip rests. It was very easy to follow and if I was unsure how to perform an exercise with proper form, they had a tutorial to walk you through it. Considering that I had never trained core seriously beforehand, the progress from start to now is insane! I highly recommend this app to anyone who is looking for the right exercises to properly train your core",5
7030,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"This is not the app advertised, but this is exactly the app that I was looking for and couldn't find. Essentially, the app automatically takes you through a short series cardio/strength bodyweight exercises that gradually increase in difficulty. It automatically times your exercises, and verbally tells you the next one, so you don't have to constantly check your phone.",5
7031,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Best workout app I ever used. Perfect in every way. Animations of exercise are easy to follow, coaching tips (which can be turned off after learning the ins and outs of each exercise) helped me learn where I was doing an exercise wrong. Reminders are nice. Weight tracking is great as well. I already downloaded splits in 30 days from the people that make this app and will download more in the future. Thanks!!!!",5
7032,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Seems to be working, and it's free! There are ads that play at the end of your workout on the free version, but the exercises are challenging. I'm on day 17 right now going through the medium intensity program. I curse a lot as I'm doing it, but feel great once it's done. Your mileage may vary, but I definitely think this can give me a much tighter core in 30 days.",5
7033,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"For a free app, this one is probably the best out there this company. Anyways, there are several different apps that I use highly recommended. Ads are not too bad, the only thing I can suggest would be to have the ability to remove and exercise and add a different one when there is an exercise that is not at your level. The whole entire set may be perfect, but there may be one exercise that you just can't do. I just do a different exercise.",5
7034,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I haven't gotten to far so I may change this, of o haven't that's a good sign! For the very first lesson, (I'm NOT FIT CUTRENTLY AT ALL) it pushed my limit just a bit but honestly that's a good thing, and I think this looks super promising! Good balance and I'm glad you can add more time to resting (mainly before planks is when I use it if my stomach hurts a ton) and also awesome that they give a video if you don't understand how to do it just from the animation thing. Overall awesome so far! :D",5
7035,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Ad supported ab workout app. Ads typically play after working out, which is minor irritation, and can be removed for $5. The app itself is pretty good: it guides you through a series of exercises that take about ten minutes per day. A robotic voice gives tips like ""keep your shoulders on the ground."" I'm a week in, so I haven't achieved rock hard abs yet, but so far I'm feeling pretty good. Recommend trying!",5
7036,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Well this is great app, easy to use, with examples for every exercise and showing also the muscles this particular exercise targeting, as long you will keep a constant effort believe me you will see results. I dropped from 183.2 to 171.2 in a month doing just this app 15 minutes tops a day. Good luck, you all worth it to look and feel good. Peace ‚úåÔ∏è oh and by the way its free.",5
7037,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Great app! I really like how to app gives you detail instructions for each exercise, with an animated video and an instructional video to make sure I'm doing it correctly. It gives you breaks in between each exercise and you choose how long you want to catch your breath before continuing. With a lot of exercise apps, I have to follow along, I fall behind, I feel like I'm doing the exercises wrong. But with this you do it at your own pace. Love it!",5
7038,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Powerfully simple. 10 minute routine, starting slowly with a few easy exercises, which I needed. Building up slowly each day, changing types and repetitions. Daily reminder to keep me on track. Simple voice coach announces next exercise, timer count-down for last few seconds, then repeats at beginning with total and each side counts, as well as random hints on form. Simple animated graphic and button links to written guide and video example if needed in clean interface. I use the minimum of what it can do and it's all I need for now. 7 days in and I'm already much stronger in my abs, obliques and lower back.",5
7039,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I LOVE this app, I've been using it for YEARS, AND IT IS SOOOOO EFFECTIVE. Alot of people think that these things dont work because they aren't lifting with their abs, and the use momentum or thrust, when instead they need to go slow and go with only their abs. The moment they realize this.. the results are astonishing... some people might go through every single one, but I just use number 13, on the hardest level. I've went through every single one a couple of time, and 13 is highly recommended",5
7040,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Great, app! This app is set up for a quick exercise session that doesn't require any equipment. They make it easy to see how to do each exercise with an animation and a video link. It tracks your progress and gives you tips as you're exercising. You can turn on your music on a separate app and listen while you exercise. Simple and effective. I'm considering buying the no ad version.",5
7041,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"as someone who stays in shape but looks to challenge my muscles with new workouts, this has been convenient and challenging. I chose the second out of three difficulties and blow through the first round of exercises. round two has me taking the recommended breaks to get through them. I feel accomplished afterwards and keep that simulated feeling in my abs all day.",5
7042,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Simple and Easy. Excercising for anyone can be summarize by: ""You're either going to do it or you won't"". This app gives you simple things to do. If you don't want to go to a gym, this app is nice. Keep in mind you still need to do your own research and pay attention to your body for safety. If something hurts or is too hard, it gives options for an easier alternative. If the overall excersise is too hard or too easy, there's options to adjust. Good app if you like simpliciy. Try a diet too.",5
7043,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Easy to use. Nice progressive program. Varies exercises to make it progressively harder and add variety. I like it very much. One small suggestion(not enough to lose a star) is to make the app data portable. I switched phones. I know where I left off, still would be nice to visually see progress. Very good app nonetheless.",5
7044,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I've been using this app for several months now and really enjoy it. I downloaded it looking to switch up the same core routine I'd been doing forever, and it's certainly provided new exercises and motivation. I generally do the advanced routine and skip through the breaks and this seems to do the trick. Each workout takes around 15-20 minutes this way (would take far longer and probably be less effective if taking the 30 seconds pause between each exercise). Love the how-to features. Thank you.",5
7045,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"This app is great. I'd recommend this and other exercising apps from this same company. It's the best workout partner that's freeüëç. The adds don't interrupt the exercises and aren't frequent. And after the first day you start with this app, it sets a time to remind you to start the next day (which is handy). You can change the notification to any time that best fits your schedule. You can really feel the differenceüí™üòé when you start.",5
7046,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"One of the better apps for working out! I rarely leave a review so this one is def worth it. I chose the intermediate routine n it's on the easier side for me but you always could just do more reps than they suggest. The coaching is the Perfect Amount, Great tips but not Obnoxious talking!! Only tips for developers: - use real human voice instead of the robot. - use real human movement instead of the drawings. - lastly maybe throw in 2 more cardio movements to add variance.",5
7047,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Simple, easy voice and gif assisted workouts so even if you arent sure how to do the workouts it will guide you through them and time you. It also tracks your progress and generates a report to show how you're doing. Downside is the ads, they can be a bit much sometimes; A purchasable ad-free version would be nice. But overall I give this a 10/10, not bad at all for $Free.99",5
7048,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,great app to get into shape they guide you along the whole way and shows you how to do the exercises. I would work out here and there on my own run out of different exercises to do when eventually just stop doing it all together. This gives you a plan it'll remind you at a certain time of the day and it has someone guide you through each workout I've got great results so far. It also allows different levels of difficulty depending on what you're going for.,5
7049,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Super easy to use and is super efficient. You can play music in the background without being interrupted by voiceovers. If you would like voiceovers then there is a button you can press to turn it on. The app has a great layout, and is really simple to find stuff on it. It also has little characters showing you how to do the exercise, which makes it easier to follow the exercise.",5
7050,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Anyone-ANYONE struggling to lose weight at all needs to give this app a go! Used for about 3 months straight before I had to break for surgery, and I impatiently wait til I can use it again! Absolutely in love with the benefit of a brisk, yet effective, and demanding fast-paced work out system that helps to target my arms and legs along with my torso. I've seriously recommended it to a few of my acquaintances and friends. There's a sense of accomplishment and pride after each work out for me!",5
7051,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I honestly thought that this was one of those clickbait apps that suck, but it was the exact opposite. It has amazing animated gifs to show how to do each exercise, with video tutorials on how to do each one if you're still confused. I don't think you're gunna get abs in 30 days, but you will definitely see results in those 30 days, and eventually get abs. Amazing app, there's a reason for the 4.9 star rating.",5
7052,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I have only done the 1st excersize on the second level and I honestly thought it wouldnt be hard. But it was honestly somewhat difficult there was one time I had to take an extra 20 seconds but over all on my first experience I thought it had an amazing ab work out and cant wait to see my results when i finish this level let alone the next one.,5
7053,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Wow. I usually just assume it'll be like a list of basic features blanketed in 3 million ads a second but no. This is everything I could've asked for. Simplistic, user friendly, super practical, and so far effective. You can feel it. They weren't kidding when they said this was good. Also the ads? Litterally not even a problem.",5
7054,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Great app for losing belly fat and developing core strength. App is very easy to use and has different levels of difficulty based on your health and or what you aim to accomplish. It gives you small tutorials on how to do the given exercise correctly which is key to getting the proper benefit from it as well as to avoid injury. I've had it for 2 years and have recommended it to many in my workout circles as a great means to supplement your training regimen specifically to focus on core strength.,5
7055,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Excellent core 30-day workouts with 3 different levels of intensity, different exercises for each day of the 30 days, and optional notifications to help keep you on track. Even offers tips and suggestions, with visual aids for each exercise. Essentially, this app gives you everything you need to both acheive & maintain a fit abdomen at home. I Highly recommend this.üëçüèª",5
7056,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"So I paid to get rid of the ads so I can continue my workouts with no interruptions. Those 15 second ads, add up & take time from your life. Time is something you don't get back so I paid to stop the interruptions. Great app nonetheless. Great workouts, I like how it changes everyday & it's not the same. I highly recommend this app to anyone trying to get back in shape or lose a couple pounds.",5
7057,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"It's the only app that has actually worked, and it completely free. The ads aren't bad at all; about every 3 workout sessions (which are about 15 min each) it gives you an ad that you can skip instantly. It adapts to you to give you the best experience and outcome. Best workout app I've found. I strongly suggest it.",5
7058,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I really like this app because it gives little tips during each exercise. It's also simple and right to the point. They provide videos with how to do a certain exercise if you're having trouble, which is helpful for anyone who's inexperienced with working out in general. I personally enjoy it and I'm sticking true to the routine so far. I highly recommend starting from beginner and working your way up. It's a 3-month process, which I'm still in the middle of, but it's definitely worth it.",5
7059,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I've been using this for months. Fantastic free app. I've been battling back issues for years. Using this app for core exercises has helped tremendously. Only thing a bit deceiving are the ripped models with no body fat. Takes dieting to look like that, and none is mentioned. Other than that, this is an amazing app! And no, I have not been paid for this review.",5
7060,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I have tried to complete the 30 days multiple times but fell off each time. But I noticed big difference in my abs each time. So I'm trying again, the latest update is a game changer! I can finally adapt the routine to how I'm feeling each day. Overall a great app with reasonable ads. Really appreciate the new update, I think I'll actually do all 30 days this time.",5
7061,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Had this app on my phone for over a year but never used it cuz I thought it might be complicated or too challenging...boy was I wrong!!! Great app with automated timer for each workout...u can also skip the timers. Shows real videos on how to do the workouts if the animations aren't clear enough. Voice coach gives suggestions during the workout if it's too hard or easy. Love this app!!! Wish I started using it a long time ago!,5
7062,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"great app! there are three different 30 day programs. each of the workouts is guided and have great tutorials. the app tells you which exercise is next, how much time is left, counts down at half time and 3 2 1, and has a rest periodnim between. once you start the workout you really don't need to touch your phone anymore. adds are minimal. love it a highly recommend it.",5
7063,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"At first I though this would be an ad filled junk workout app that wanted to make money more than help beginners with weight and midsection problems. This app gets you going and has a ""Siri-esque"" voice coach to help you during each workout. Each set is no longer than 30 seconds and when I finish each day I feel like I can do more. Within the first week I have lost 2 pounds along with dieting. This has helped by increasing heart rate and focusing exercises on midsection. Great job and thank you!",5
7064,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Awesome app, ads are annoying but the workout and stretching are great. You can take it at your own pace. I recommend starting with the beginner section and working your way up depending on where your at. Will problably be purchasing it without ads at somepoint but you can get all the usefulness without spending any money as far as I can tell.",5
7065,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Had the app for maybe about a year but never was determined enough yo use it just yet. Finally used it and it was pretty simple and the animation tutorials helped a ton. I started off with Intermediate/Rock Hard Abs is what I believe it's called. Only Day 1 in and was able to complete the exercises in less than 10mins while I threw in extra reps with most exercises. Abdominal muscle didnt really start feeling sore until about exercise 14/17. Can feel slight tightening but consistency will help,5
7066,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Just started using this app along with the partner apps: home workout and the planking app. Decent exercise, minimal ads that can be quickly skipped. There are 3 levels to choose from: beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Working my way through beginner then on to the next level and so on. We'll see what the results are in 90 days.",5
7067,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"This is the best ab workout app I've ever used! Very straightforward, and has something for all levels of workout experience. Typically, I've struggled to find a ab workout app that meets me where I am (extreme novice who struggles with complicated ab exercises). I'm 21 days into the beginners series and can't wait to see what the next level has in store. Do yourself a favor and download this app today!",5
7068,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I'm only on my third week but already love the way this app walks me through the steps, including rest periods, and introduces new exercises. At 57 years old I've found out that walking more and eating less doesn't get rid of my ""love handles"". I need the regiment this app provides. Using the alarm setting really helps keep me on track. I already see progress. And, progress is progress no matter how small.",5
7069,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I don't review stuff often but when I do it's because it's worth it and this app is definitely it. This app has a good combinations of workouts and stretches (which are included in the exercise) as well as, well calculated rest period, for example the program I do has me working out 3 out of 4 days which allows me to rejuvinate and adjust for the next day so I can keep going, and it has begginer program for people who are just starting out. Narrator's voice can be in various languages 11/10",5
7070,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"This is a really great plan with really great results. I do recommend changing your diet if you plan on doing this, as I noticed when I still ate fast food the results decreased severely. Good carbs and protein is essential and with that in mind, these exercises do work your core as well as other muscles. Great job to the developers, and cannot wait to continue using this app for future exercises as well as your other applications",5
7071,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,So far its working great. Theres one ad before you start if you use the 3d models that show you how to do something and one ad after you finish. I can honestly feel it working after a couple days. Im using this app to lose some weight for now. Theres 3 different levels. One for beginners and to lose weight. Next is getting abs. Next is turning them to a six pack. Im liking it so far.,5
7072,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Honestly for a newbie trying to strengthen his core, and work on getting rid of gut fat this workout app is perfect it is pretty easy to do the workout routines and if you want to incorporate more stuff you can it shows the movements of each move to be performed and even records your daily workout times overall I am happy with the app ads are annoying but they need to make money some how being this is a free app and all",5
7073,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I had a killer 6 pack before I got a leg injury and couldn't workout for 6 montye. I needed something to get me back on track after recovery and this is doing the trick. The 30 sec breaks between each exercise is unnecessary but that's what the skip button is for! Keep striving to improve yourself in anyway you can and you'll find it üí™üí™,5
7074,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"This app does just what it sets out to do. I'm currently using the easiest portion, the ""lose belly fat"" plan. It's a touch too easy, so I simply do more reps, making it just right for me. I can't wait to try the harder ones! I'm not a fan of the daily weigh-in, but it's interesting to track, I guess. The graphics and vocal coaching tips make sure you know how to do each exercise.",5
7075,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Took some time for me to jump in on this. Day 2 so far, and it's pretty awesome. Using Note9, is it possible to make it run coinciding with other apps? I tried it but it won't let me. Unlike the other apps which allows them to be floating or in split mode, this app only has lock option. And the counting stops when you go into another app and it just continue when you open it back again. Considering that it's free, I shouldn't even be complaining. haha! Thanks for the great free app!",5
7076,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Just started on my new health journey... This app is a tool makes it easier to exercise as it has the timer, example of exercise, rest times, and different levels as I look forward to putting in the work to get to those levels! All with one easy to use app! This IS the app you need for your exercise routine. Dont forget... Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life! Amen.",5
7077,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,Downloaded this app after I reached a plateau with another and it didn't give me the six pack but I did get a 4 pack. The exercises do a lot for the core and the use of the dumbbells is a plus. I'm a mom of 2 & my tummy has never looked better. Definitely eat clean and workout daily and you will see results. My only deterrent is the inability to add on to the times for certain things like the plank. I'll still give it 5 stars because I'm able to amp up my workouts with different weights.,5
7078,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I like that it has a timer with a loud bell so I know it's done. I like that it times your whole workout with estimated calories burned. I like that there's multiple difficulty levels depending on where you're starting from. I like that even though it has breaks between exercises, I can skip if I don't want to wait the full 30 sec. The only thing I wish I could do is play music at the same time but it's a sacrifice I can live with for a free trainer this good!",5
7079,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I think I see pretty good results overall but when you transition from one program to the next, it actually doesn't get progressively more difficult. They should be a progression on one another. I feel like I'm going. I feel like since I started the rock hard ABS portion, I've gone backwards Sometimes I would double down and do two exercises in one day. It took me almost 90 days to actually get a six pack but from almost nothing",5
7080,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,The app works it gives the results promised if you do ALL the exercises the app requires you to do for your specific plan just warning you do the exercises right sometimes the animation isn't so clear and you may need to watch a video (E.g)Russian twist in the animation looks like the man's legs are on the ground but the excersise requires you keep your legs above ground I think all we need are slightly better animations and we are golden!other than that great app it works it really does!,5
7081,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I'm only on day 6, but so far it seems like this app is exactly what I needed to get my stomach back in shape. It's easy to follow along, it reminds me each day to start, and the way each day's routine is laid out -- it really makes it feel like this is doable. You can skip rest periods if it seems like it's too easy and you can extend them if it's too hard. The tips that the app gives you are spot on and it's cool to hear the little bits of info about each exercise while you're doing them.",5
7082,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"This app is incredible. For the entirety of my life exercise has been the one thing that's really kept me breathing and On My Feet. Among the many other aspects of physical movement I have used to keep myself alive, this one has been one of the most helpful as the app is easy to use, especially in the case of me being on the verge of a panic attack, and and while the app understandably has ads, they are only at the beginning and end of workout and are completely non-invasive of each regiment.",5
7083,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I've only been using it for a couple of days, but its pretty easy to do and its only about a 6 min work out. You dont even need any equipment. The best thing is that for the most part you can go at your own pace. (Just wanted to add this because i didnt see it in the description no monthly fees for the program. They use ads to pay for it but they're barely noticeable)",5
7084,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"This is great for someone like me who likes to do a solid bit of a work out every day and needs a formula to keep myself from just saying ""I guess I'll just do a crunch or two."" Taught me a bunch of new ab workouts. Really recommend this entire app series, honestly, as I like to do the regular ""home workout"" one when I'm not just targeting abs. It DOES have annoying ads but only before and after workout. Small price to pay for a digital trainer these days.",5
7085,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,It's a 5-star experience thus far. This app is a great complement to my current exercise routine that includes cardio and resistance training. I don't have to think about the next core workout; the app provides the variety I need to target all my abdominal muscles. Currently on beginner and working my way to intermediate. I'll provide a status update next month.,5
7086,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Sweating in the best way at the end of day 1, session one and in shorter time than anticipated. Pretty dang smart to add in the optional skip button to optimize anyone's comfort with intensity without sacrificing the effectiveness (will be gauging this factor moving forward). In all honesty, im feeling some serious activation burn and eagerly await the results of staying the 30-day course. GREAT PRODUCT, so far, so good, and hopefully so long daddy gut!",5
7087,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I love to feel the burn at the end of each session and also the ads aren't really annoying they only show up in between rests(as banners so you can still do other stuff) and in the end it never interrupts your work out. I like login in each day and watching the product at the end of the challenge which (if done properly) is very beneficial.,5
7088,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,If android didn't erase the app with its terriable memory manager when I was doing a download three days before the I compleated a full 90 days it would have been perfect. The ads are annoying when you are trying to play music and run the app. And running burger king and pizza hut ads in a fitness app is real classy. But the workout is solid and the calendar keeps you on track. The rest days built into the schedule are nice and if I miss a day I know that there is rest banked into the routine.,5
7089,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,I love this app. It chooses exercise ls with limited injury risk and its mid program adjustments are great to keep it at your level. I did 60 days in 120 days then took off 2 months. When I came back it was too advanced. I selected the option to make it easier and it adjusted.,5
7090,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I love this app! It truely works, and after about 10 days, i was very impressed with the results! I would highly encourage anyone who wants a six pack to download immediately! The other cool bonus to this app is that there are two extra plans that come with the app, one is a belly fat loss, and the other one is to get rock hard abs! Good luck and I hope that you can get the same results as I did!",5
7091,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"So far so good, I really like the app in terms of how much my abs hurt afterwardsüòÇ I think the exercises are very dynamic and different each day (some repeat of course). I recommend it specially for people who, like me, have no clue about what exercises to perform for the abs, or no willpower to exercise the abs. They was me, and now I can say with certainty that I'm very happy. I tried different apps from the same developers and I'm happy with them! üí™üòÅ",5
7092,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I've enjoyed using the Six Packs in 30 Days app, but I have a suggestion for improvement. It would be great if the next update could allow users to remove unwanted exercises individually, especially those with timers that can't be skipped. This customization feature would enhance the overall user experience. written by a.i because I don't speak English that much i gave 5 stars because this app helped me a lot",5
7093,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"I recently tried the ""Six Packs in 30 Days"" app, and it exceeded my expectations! The structured workout plans and easy-to-follow exercises make it accessible for beginners and challenging for those at an advanced fitness level. The daily reminders keep me on track, and the progress tracker is motivating. In just a few weeks, I've seen noticeable improvements in my core strength. This app is a game-changer for anyone looking to sculpt their abs effectively. Five stars without a doubt!",5
7094,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"The app is really cool, it's a satisfactory, Just follow the instructions and you are good to go, it also guides you on how to do certain exercises even if you have never done it before, Furthermore it tells u what to and what not to do during the exercise to avoid injuries Good one ‚úåÔ∏èüëçüëå",5
7095,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Great app for ab workouts! Starts out easy and progressively becomes more challenging. Includes, timer, voices and models to display the correct range of motion. I highly recommend it to improve core strength.",5
7096,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"OK, so I highly doubt this will actually give you a six pack in 30 days, but hey, everyone has to clickbait. Except for this, I have been doing excersises with this app and it has been 20x better than what I do normally everyday, and it motivates me with notifications. I know this sounds like a bot review - trust me it isn't.",5
7097,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"App installed great, tailored a workout plan for me, easy to follow and learn, full of helpful hints to prevent injury, and the app provided the results I was expecting. Ads don't interrupt the workout. Thanks Leap!",5
7098,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Its designed simple without a lot of extra bull you don't need. I'm VERY new to fitness and I love how you don't need equipment, and it has animations, directions, and videos of each exercise if you need it.",5
7099,sixpack.sixpackabs.absworkout,"Thisis an excellent app that helps you get a six-pack in just 30 days. It has a user-friendly interface, clear instructions, and a variety of effective exercises. The program gradually intensifies over time, keeping you motivated. The app also offers reminders and progress tracking. Even if six packs don't come out in 30 days, but a good physical activity for good health.",5

7200,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,It's definitely not free as the first review states. Also after you purchase your plan they bombard you with multiple add on options that you would think come with the plan you purchased. For this reason I cancelled immediately and am now waiting for my refund. Update: It was not at all apparent that it was an ad that I clicked on. In fact it was the very first thing I saw when opening the app. If you're not affiliated with them you should take care and make sure they are removed permanently.,1

7237,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,this is a really bad app compared to the their previous ones. I had the worst case of muscle cramp after an abdominal workout. The idea of a cobra stretch after planking is not recommended as it does lead to muscle cramp.

7244,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,This app is not what they say. It costs a lot of money to do program. The food recipes are very expensive to buy and you can't find some of it at a normal grocery store. They put on the hard sell to buy there expensive supplements and they are shipped from out of the country and not made in the USA. Really this is the same as all the other personal trainers at any chain gym.

7399,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Good aap,1
7400,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Started out amazing! Kept me motivated, made it all seem possible. Definitely got me into wanting to work out every day, which is awesome! However, the fault comes in when it ramps you up WAY too fast.   There are exercises that just aren't feasible, especially after selecting beginner. On top of that, it's common knowledge that doing an exercise in bad form is even worse for you, so we shouldn't be attempting certain exercises until we're physically able.   I would love to keep using it, but the pacing is so far off it's painful. Needs a little more human curation.",2
7401,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Edit: like the routine, but the ads are getting obnoxiously difficult to bypass due to fake exit buttons or super small exit buttons. I'm starting to looking for better options. Original: Very good way to get back into or get into exercising. The routines are challenging enough that you sweat, but fast enough to not impact your schedule much. I will say it's poor taste to show advertisements for Ritz crackers while I'm struggling through V-Situps though.",2
7402,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Exercises are heavily ab focused, and progress too quickly. Week 1 on beginner was wry too easy, but by week 3 I was unable to compete most of the exercises each day. The ads were ok at first, but it seems like they are getting longer and more annoying every day. Entering weight is frustrating because it automatically adds .00, and forces you to delete those digits in order to just change a single digit. Seriously... who tracks weight to within +/- 0.01?",2
7403,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Workouts are fine. But keeps bringing up were it wants me to pay for a membership. I have to shut the app down multiple times. To get it to let me get to the screen with the workouts.,2
7404,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,I have tried a lot but plan is not loading for excercise.,2
7405,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Two days on. Exercises are good. I like everything about the app... Oh that two star review? Oh, that's the beginning and ending ads. They pop up and NEVER close. Just sit there. No way to close except to force close the app. Click the advert? Hit back? Tab between apps? Wait many minutes? Nope. App is broken in the worst possible way. Again, content is 5 stars.",2
7406,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"I am giving 2 star because i dont know what is the ultimate goal the owner if this app has, there is not a single warm up exercise tutorial etc. Direct to workout for beginners. Also, the reverse crunch is IMPOSSIBILE for a beginner. Atleast have a tutorial video which can make it least possible or make exercise that suits for a beginner ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Also, the exercise count down begins begin directly without informing the user how to perform it. I had to manually pause it everytime, check description",2
7407,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,It is an fantastic app for workouts. However after 30 days plan if there can be a reset/restart button to being all over again it will be really good. With the current design after 30 days if we want to continue the days are tick marked and it's a bit confusing to see which day we are in.,2
7408,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"The adds, on the free version don't shut down, so you have to close the app, and open it again. If you close the app, after doing your exercises, when the ad doesn't shut, you are brought right back to the beginning of the day you have just done.",2
7409,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,So I tried this app and I selected advance work out. I was not satisfied at all due to the fact that most of the exercise are mostly the same and it does not change by its own. You can change some of the workout but the purpose of a personal trainer is to let the trainer tell you what to do. Also when I select a specific category in the low impact or no jumping the workout didn't change at all. I didn't lose weight and I am a guy who is working out. I will unistall it and try a different app.,2
7410,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,I have to question the integrity and experience of those who design these apps. I have been visiting the gym regularly for over 30yrs. For the second time I have discovered exercises that are a totally pointless waste of time. Flutter kicks have absolutely no benefits whatsoever. Listen to your own body and it will inform you that this routine is useless and serves no purpose at all.,2
7411,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"This app takes to long to open for me to babysit it like a tamagotchi. There are so many ads mixed into the UI, it's difficult to determine which are additional tools/features from the developer or sponsored links. I can't imagine using this for free, and certainly not a paid subscription. I was done with it in 12 hours.",2
7412,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Well it has good exercises and everything but it is quite unusable. After every workout it freezes and I have to restart. A TON of ads along with that. This would be 5 stars if it didn't freeze all the time.,2
7413,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Some exercises are a bit antiquated and not well explained though easy enoigh that you don't need an explanation (or shouldn't). The use of BMI is pretty abysmal considering how inaccurate of a measure of overall fitness it is, but you can always opt to just use bodyfat% yourself and ignore all but the premade workouts, which is honestly responsible for both stars here as it is a nice relief to not have to program myself. That being said, this app needs several updates and improvements.",2
7414,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"i did the month lost pretty much like 20 pounds and i can say that the work outs this app gives you are very bad there are ways that are mich better to lose weight like sprinting im pretty sure this app was created by a 9 year old that looked up ""best core exercises"" on the jngernet clicked the first link and copy and pasted it into this app. best thing this app did for me was motivate me to make myself better",2
7415,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"The app is awesome but i like to workout using splitscreen mode watching a video or listening to audio. After the AD plays, i have to switch to full screen to close out the app which gets annoying",2
7416,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Great performance ... highly impressed by the overall app... but giving 2 stars due to the types of advertisment shown in between the functioning. Very lewd and filthy contents shown in it. This must be taken care as it is not something which can ve displayed publicly... please remove these kinds pf ad and I think you shoud go for more family-safe content,2
7417,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Points to add: 1. Add a button to extend the time limit during the exercise. E.g. +10 secs 2. There is a rest day, but if the user wants to do then allow the user to do the exercise. 3. Allow the user to select the rest day. 4. Add subtitles as some technical words we don't know. 5. Add benefits section of doing that particular exercise.",2
7418,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"I have been using this app to lose weight and tone up but when I finished I didn't get any difference even that I followed it as accurate as it told me to. This app is a waste of time, was very eager to loose weight but very disappointed and crushed my expectations.üòû",2
7419,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,This app will very nice my weight is 62 I am 14 years old but this app using 30 days before my weight 57 very nice üëç,2
7420,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"The exercises are good, although can you make an addition like a background music sound just like in women version of this app, its very helpful for us and it will make a difference in the way we workout as supposed to the no sound which will make us boring and more exhausted early",2

7422,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Its so cool app. I am using this app for five days and Iam feeling that my weight is a lil bit of loose. I will give this app five Star when I get my full result. Thanksü•∞ü•∞ü§õ,2
7423,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,The lendingtree ad prevents me from using the app. It comes up and renders the app useless until app is closed out and restarted - hence losing all workout progress and logs for the day. Very upsetting please look into this.,2
7424,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Didnt get the required result with this app its advertised as weight loss but us more for building strength and tone and is no good for burning fat. Done this app for three weeks woth no results. Switched to a cardio and hiit based app and started getting results in the first few days. A week after switching I had shredded the weight and have lost 6lbs in a week.,2
7425,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Its a great app.. I really lov the workout. But the app experience is terrible it needs fixing. It does not show reports and history after workout it shuts down. Bugs needs fixing..,2
7426,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"After watching the video to upgrade to the complete plan there was no link just the video. I don't know about the free weight loss app yet, maybe I will change my rating if it is useful.",2
7427,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,I changed phones and I thought since it syncs to google for the data of my past workouts would be there but it didn't transfer. Have to start all over again.,2
7428,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"It's crashes. After completing daily exercise it automatically closes without showing any result. Even I couldn't check the status, whenever I am trying to do so it automatically exits.",2
7429,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Good but I highly recommend going into airplane mode while using the app. I understand ads are needed, but they take over your phone in an obnoxious way.",2
7430,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"I like the app okay, but it should be more customizable and have more exercises. I want to work out every muscle group, not just my core. Also, the name of the app is an oversight. How am I supposed to share this with a friend without implying that they need to lose weight?",2
7431,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Good app but too much annoying adds! It appears between each exercise which covers the whole screen so you have to stop training and scroll the Add!! Don't download it.,2
7432,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"I can feel the burns but when I check my weight is remains same, I see no change. I feel like it only tightens your body but weight lose as the name suggested.",2
7433,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"This app just reminds you to workout. The best weight loss is fixing your diet and combining that with exercise, this is just a home workout. Dont get me wrong it can help you, but if you dont eat right you will not get the best results.",2
7434,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,I entered my third month on this app with great expectations after a solid one month only to find it does not advance the days. It keeps returning me to Day 1 so I have lost my rhythm and momentum. Sad. Was enjoying it.,2
7435,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"I like this app quite well, but I do not like the drink water notifications. There doesn't seem to be a way to turn them off. Uninstalled after the app opened a dialog for a water reminder.",2
7436,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,There is no benefit to the given exercise in this app. I used it for 2 months but there was no difference. Most of the exercises in this app are unused which does not help to lose the weight. Join a gym but don't use it. This app is waste of time.,2
7437,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Most of this workout routine literally just to strong up your muscle core and toning which is good, but to lose weight? No. This app literally wasting your time, If your goal is to lose weight quickly, i suggest do cardio and on a calorie defecit thats it.",2
7438,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"The exercises become very exhausting eventually; and, for your struggle there aren't even visible results. At the time of writing this, I got up to day 15, which is half of the program, I weighed myself and I saw literally NO difference (also none in my physique) . There isn't enough visible motivation to make the struggle worth it.",2

I think all the review are fake . Or I might be different from all who says I lose my too much weight in one month. I am totally unsatisfied from this app my opinion that you can try it but not 100% you weight is lose . I waiting for app developer reply. Thanks for reply but I didn't understand. I try to loose weight.,2
7442,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Two star because of the fuel problem thing you need to wait an hour to refuel it and I think you can't increase the size of the fuel thing when you travel if so please update the app where we can increase the fuel capacity or an ads where we watch 3 ads for 30 minute free fuel thing,2
7443,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,This doesnt work. I used this regularly for 30 days but i didnt lost anything. I ll stop using it but still i love this app. Very good stages and i like cobra stretch,2
7444,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Very misleading, it says that you lose body fat through exercises, which is not true, the diet is 90% of losing body fat. This app did nothing for me ofc, I got a lot of abdominal muscles but the fat covers them.",2
7445,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Exercise is decent I guess but the ads are very annoying, every click leads to a 5-10 second add, it just gets very annoying.",2
7446,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"The app looks awful on my Huawei tablet, I guess it's mostly used on phones. I personally like to use the tablet's big display while working out at home.",2
7447,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Add 5+ easy warmup exercises before going to direct reps/timer. I started to feel headache with eye pain in a flow which was due to lack of enough warm-up exercises.,2
7448,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Doesn't know whether the calories burnt are accurate or not??? Clarify that it is Kcal or call because by just doing 10-15 exercise how can anyone lose that much amount of kcal. Rather than this everything is perfect.,2
7449,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"It's a good app but why does the app has no notification even though I didn't disable it and it also didn't have any coaching voice, it's just pure silence. I hope you guys can fix this bugs",2
7450,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,I really like this app. But I am getting way too many ads in all the apps since I installed this. I think I will uninstall it. Is there anything you can do about it??,2

7599,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Best but hard practice,2
7600,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"This is a mixed bag: it has workout reminders and the vast majority of the app is customizable if you take a few seconds to explore the options. On the downside, it is not beginner friendly, there is no rhyme or rhythm to the order of exercises (be prepared for a lot of random getting up and laying down), there is no warm-up, and the routines have odd difficulty spikes rather than a smooth difficulty curve.",3
7601,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"So far I generally like the app. Some things I would like to see changed/added, when editing an exercise to a different one or offering negative feedback on the exercise offer a similar but different exercise to replace it in every future workout the original is/was in. I thought something like this occurred in the beginning, but it doesn't now. Also a different coach/voice option would be appreciated. So far the advertisements are for the worst companies around, nothing I would ever use/buy.",3
7602,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"I did a good job keeping up with this app for about 3 weeks. Somewhere around day 18 the exercises jumped in difficulty or workout length or something and it suddenly felt undoable. Lost motivation. I might start over from day 1, but will be sad to ""lose"" the progress. Wish there was a way to slow down the difficulty scaling.",3
7603,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"The new UI looks not so good especially when comparing with the previous one which was very good. I always felt this app had one of the best UI I have seen. The new UI doesn't give that feel anymore. üòî. Functionality aspect also was good in previous one. (Sliding weight for BMI doesn't seem like a nice option - Sliding is not as easy as typing to input) If the new UI is in A/B testing, I would prefer the old UI overall.",3
7604,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Would prefer if my exercises didnt drastically increase. I did the beginner workout and started off with a 30 second plank that I barely mamaged. In day 4 in jumped to 90 seconds when all i voted was ""just right"" for the exercises",3
7605,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Pretty cool app, I really like how they ease you into the workouts without making you feel too overwhelmed. I hurt myself the last time I used this. The time between different exercises is definitely not long enough for someone that is new. I was trying to see the picture of how to do a certain exercise, while the timer is counting down and trying to get you ready for the next one. I felt very rushed and moved between exercises too quickly. P.s. the water notification sound is disgusting",3
7606,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,this app is working anymore for me I got to intermediate and then the workout screen turned white pls fix this bug,3
7607,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"After over a year not having used the app, I started doing the exercises again. The app has changed. It's to much abdomen focussed, less variation in exercises throughout the days. Adding the warm-up is nice, but it's too simple for a warm-up, also Jumping Jacks are gone now. I'd rather start with that than instead of the warm-up. 'Thumb down' exercises are not ignored. Making up my own exercises now.",3
7608,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Only giving 3 stars, as beginner workout is too aggressive for a beginner recovering or suffering with health issues. The start counter is also annoying, it counts down 3,2,1 start. Then gives you a 3 second count down on the screen after. the spok count down is the end of the rest timer and not the actual start timer. Should be a simple fix. Fix the count down and add a light workload and it would be a 5 star app.",3
7609,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Decent enough but I don't use the programs I just make my own. what's frustrating is that it doesn't have all the exercises so I have to use both this and the Lose belly fat App. And that's not even counting the exercises in the ab app or the home workout app. frustrating. it would be nice to have everything in one app.,3
7610,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"I used this for 10 days. Even with the rest days, I felt sore. The cobra stretches every day were painful, especially for an overweight guy. Some of the other exercises were also painful and did not seem to progress logically. There were no warm-ups or cool-downs. It seems more appropriate for someone who already has experience and not truly for older beginners. Constant getting up and down between exercises is an extra challenge in itself for older obese people.",3
7611,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Workouts get boring after a while. I've been using this app for a long time and honestly, it does work although when you go from beginner to intermediate to advanced, you'll notice that the workouts just repeat themselves (in a single session) like a cycle. It gets really demotivating and tiresome. I have no problem with doing 30 excercises if they're varied and not the same 10 exercises 3 times.",3
7612,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"It's generally okay, but did not preserve any data when I copied everything on new phone. Also, the option for including a short warm-up before the actual exercises disappeared. It's usable, but lacks in variety and individual options. Also very limited if it comes to entering weight and monitoring progress.",3
7613,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Not free. Uninstalled. I can't tell you if it's good or not, but I can say they should be upfront about pricing. Response: Really? I couldn't get past the page where it asks what payment plan I want. I started using the free Nike fitness app. Maybe I'll check yours out again and see if I'm missing something.",3
7614,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"It looks like a good app, but not one I can really use. The option to mark if you have knee problems is good (I don't,) but it needs an option to mark if you have wrist problems (I do, and can't do the exercises that put pressure on them like mountain climber, pushups and Cobra.)",3
7615,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"When I started out the 30 day program I was under the impression that I would lose at least around 3kg. By the end of the 30 days I only lost 0.5kg. I have a very bloated stomach and I still do. Although I did the intermediary difficulty, I stuck to the plan and I was consistent. In the apps defence I didnt really change to a healthy diet, just my usual diet. I've also became much more stronger than i was when I started. The app itself is really great but the end result wasn't what I expected.",3
7616,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"These exercises are really helpful when I'm in a sedate period of the year. I can't fault that and it's very handy to keep a track of where I'm at... HOWEVER, what's with the use of outmoded BMI stats? Everybody knows that body mass index figures are seriously flawed and aren't an accurate measure of health, especially in taller people. Can a waistline option be added instead?",3
7617,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"This and six-pack app from the same developer are not bad if you are bad at self-pacing for excercise, but the regimes are not balanced. This will vary for people, but roughly first half of every month will feel light and barely make you sweat, and the second will feel hard, sweat coming out of all pores and last few days may feel more like torture. Good regime increases difficulty every other day, gradually, which also helps maintain motivation. You may want to repeat older days at times.",3
7618,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Good challenging workouts that can auto adjust based on your feed back. Wish it connected to Samsung Fit. Would definitely give higher score if it did. Also very core intensive. Expected a wider full body mix with workouts. Typical it has a leg workout, a chest, and like 6 ab exercises. All body weight, which is a plus cebause I can do it anywhere #NoExcuses",3
7619,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"If you like ALOT of crunches this is a great app, well designed and easy to use. I only got half way through and stopped because of the high amount of crunches, I understand that crunches are affective but to have so many in close succession was ott. There are other exercises that have the same affect. I'm sad as the app itself is really good.",3
7620,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Could have been so much better! The following flaws really spoil this app. - Requies touching screen to get through some exercises. - Default rest interval not programable enough & again requiring touching screen to get the rest preferred. - Demonstration of next exercise should be shown enlarged insted of again requiring user to touch screen to make animation large. - No ability to cast to external screen is an inconvenience.,3
7621,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Great app and would be 5 stars IF they added a 3 second countdown tone so I dont have to look at my phone when doing the excercises. If I turn on the coaching tips and the other voice option I get the 3 second countdown but also get all this talking over my music. Please add this if not muted.,3
7622,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Early days however I have 1 major gripe. I like to listen to music with my headphones when exercising but when Spotify is at a nice volume I can't hear the instructions from this app over my music. Luckily I have a Samsung phone so I can use sound assistant to temporarily lower my music level while keeping the app at 100%. If the app automatically faded the music when instructions were being given or had an option to increase the speech volume I would give 5 stars.,3
7623,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"I really liked the it made me see what my body can do and also i lost a lot of weight and gain muscules because of it, but there was one exercise that cause me a huuuuge brain pain for an hour twice even that i drinked enough water and a perfect diet and that exercise is Squat pulses, i wish they remove it from the app.",3
7624,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"This isn't a weight loss app, so much as it's an abs toning app. Sure, it's nice to have a workout plan made for you, and it's better than doing nothing. The graphs and trackers are nice. But if you really want to get lean and lose weight, this is not the way.",3
7625,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Just OK. Lacks variety, overloads the same muscles group (pelvic) but almost ignores the back and upper body, no HIT or cardio. Easy to follow but too steep of a curve for 40+ years old. Full body workout could serve you better for losing weight, even at lower intensity.",3
7626,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"This app randomly seems to restart an exercise part way through. It has an interesting side effect of resetting your workout progress, forgetting the time spent and calories burned. What can be so motivational to working out as losing your progress halfway through?",3
7627,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Simple but effective. App is very easy to use and the instructions are clear with great visuals. HOWEVER..be aware this app has thousands of trackers. I used it for 6 minutes and my app blocker denied 2400+ attempts trying to collect my data Will probably delete.,3
7628,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Love the app, no doubt on that but the only thing that bugs me is that you can't switch your plan and yet have same progress. Every time I switch to a new routine like from beginner to intermediate it resets to day 1, otherwise all is good",3
7629,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,It is a good app. It will get more stars if it will stop changing my coaches voice from the male I set it to the female voice I hate with a passion everytime I start a set for the day.,3
7630,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Only 30 days? I was enjoying the app and then I finished the 30 days and didn't see a way to continue so I started over. I started at the advanced level since I already workout regularly and wanted to workout at home instead now but need a routine. This routine was nice cuz it's short, about 30 minutes AT MOST. which is nice compared to spending an hour or 2 with my usual stuff. Although one big complaint is that about 80% of this app is just ab stuff. We need cardio too! Throw in HIIT stuff.",3
7631,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"The app only focuses on the abs and after every workout the only stretch it has you do is the ""cobra stretch"" Which is for the abs too. Great if the only thing your looking to work out is the abs but there are more muscle groups than the abs so I'm getting a different app.",3
7632,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"I completed the program 5 times (beginner, intermediate, advanced, then increased pushup and plank difficulty twice). Pros: - it gets you exercising, and helps you build a routine - it really improves your strength Cons: - you won't lose weight (improving your diet, not excercise will do that) - too steep progression for some excercises (e.g., pushups) - some days are overly hard, and some overly easy, due to imbalanced mix of excercises, which can affect your motivation",3
7633,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Meh, while it's nice to get in the habit of supplementing my normal 30 min daily cardio routine, it hasn't produced any weight loss in 45 days on intermediate and then advanced. You can thumbs down exercises if they cause you injury but they'll keep giving it to you. I think I'll finish off 60 days and then move onto something that provides better results.",3

Pro tip don't do exercise if your muscles hurt. You muscles are healing after exercise and if you don't let it heal then your body can't make new and bigger muscles to replace the dead damaged muscles.App is good but the idea is 5/10.Thanks for the positive reply,3

Pro tip don't do exercise if your muscles hurt. You muscles are healing after exercise and if you don't let it heal then your body can't make new and bigger muscles to replace the dead damaged muscles.App is good but the idea is 5/10.Thanks for the positive reply,3

7996,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Too much hard level for beginners,3
7997,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"I'm younger than 18 so I can't use it because my age group isn't there. I'm gonna give it a three even though I have never used it before, but I feel like it will be a good app. If you put a thing for ages under 18 I will give this app 5 stars. I know it may take time, but if you see this and you do fix it, I will be super happy. Thank you.",3
7998,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Does it's job, a few suggestions though 1. Have an option for auto countdown on pressups/squats etc 2. Allow front camera 3. Rest days currently break your work out streak, change this, 4. Make the ads appear after the well done screen",3
7999,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Good,3
8000,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"This is a very quick update of my experience with this app. I'm giving it 4 stars now instead of the 3. Here's why... The workouts are real, and they provide a feeling of effort put into them. You can adjust many things to help you and make it perfect for you such as time, repetitions, resting time, etc. 2 days in, i'm still going to keep moving forward with this.",4
8001,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"I really enjoyed the customization options for the regimen. The voice coaching and demonstration of each workout was also great. Two things are missing. 1) I can't seem to start a new 30 day regimen without wiping the app from my phone and redownloading. 2) I would like the option of swapping out a specific workout from the day's routine. For instance, if a certain workout isn't working for me or if certain body parts are overworked from other activities.",4
8002,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"When you want to edit a plan, there arent enough exercises in them. There's no variety. You could add workouts for arms and upper body since there's a lot for the lower body (legs, thighs, etc).and user should be able to adujst warmup and how long it should be.The layout and design of the app feels a little stale. Overall this app is good, the intensity from the exercises feels properly balanced, and the inclusion of breaks as a ""day"" is an excellent addition. And adding warmups is a good idea.",4
8003,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"I've only been using the app for a few days, but I really like it so far. I live in the second story of an apartment though so I can't really do any of the exercises at home that involve jumping or running in place without disturbing my downstairs neighbors. I wish there was an easy way to filter those exercises out without having to do it manually every time. I also noticed the version of this app for women has many more options to customize your focus and workout which I wish this version had.",4
8004,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"The exercises are well described, with short videos if you require, and are ""easy"" to follow. The only accessories required is a floor mat and a chair. Intensity ramps up with time. Tracking of your progress is clear. It gave a decent result, yet no visible 6 packs... On the improvement side, the App is somehow a one time use only. If you want to redo some exercises after the first 30 days, you don't get the same follow up of your progress.",4
8005,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"This app has some great workouts, so do the other similar apps. I've lost several inches around my waist and I feel better. My only problem, and i believe it's not the app, is that I'm not losing weight. The workouts are challenging though, give a great arm workout as well as a good leg workout. Funnily enough, the intermediate seems to give a better core workout than the hardest one, but they have a different app specifically for that which I will use when I've lost some weight with this app.",4
8006,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"I've been using the app for about 2 months now supplementing my lifting workout with the app workout a few days a week. It's a really good core workout (intermediate) even though I haven't really played with the options much. Since I only use it a few times a week, I'm just now approaching the end of the 30-days and am not sure what I will do at the end as I haven't seen the options yet. Overall, I like the workouts and the options to do it at your own pace and have seen and felt results.",4
8007,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Great app, its intuitive features make it fun to use. Downsides are it goes 30 days than you reset, would be nice to keep going in full calendar and adjust dynamically. Also whatever random generator they use to create routines is broken it typically spits out same excercises and also isn't very smart, it will schedule three sets of different crunches not realize it doesn't make sense. Also doesn't have logic to realize it makes you do alot of switching from ground to standing exercises.",4
8008,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Very good tool to bring structure to your cardio exercises Hi, I previously gave 5 stars. But now reducing the rating. I like the app. I recommend it to friends. But the ads (I don't discourage ads, that's an important way to generate revenue) sometimes don't go away. The app needs to be killed and reopened to gain control. That irritates. Please correct how ads are displayed and please provide a way to dismiss ads after a certain period. 5 or 10 seconds. They should not take control of your ap",4
8009,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Just completed my first 30 days in Advanced Mode. I lost about 8 lbs. and toned up a little bit. I changed my eating habits too. I'm going to keep going for another 30 days. This app keeps me on schedule, has a variety of workouts without needing accessories but targets the abs a bit too much. EDIT: lowering to 4 stars. Tried to begin another 30 days. It let me do day 1 and now it is showing my previous 30 days complete and won't let me do anything else. Have to uninstall and reinstall and lose.",4
8010,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"I've been enjoying exercising to this app. The calendar keeps me motivated and accountable. I wish there was more to it after you complete the 30 days. This developer has a plethora of different apps revolving around fitness and if they consolidated them into one or few apps, it would've been very good. You could still charge per section within the app.",4
8011,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Honestly it's pretty darn good, I've only used it for one day so far, but giving visuals of the exercise in motion as well as some verbal pointers is really nice, it's not some scam get skinny fast app, it gives you options for duration and intensity of the sessions and gives you a varied workout with that in mind. If there's anything I'd add it would be adding warm-ups and cool-downs to the routines, giving you effective stretches for each workout.",4
8012,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"I really love this app. It contains a nice set of exercises which gave me good results after a month and a half of constant usage. The only shortcoming I recently discovered is that there should be a setting to pause the workout plan that can be used when someone is really sick. It's a little annoying to see ""don't give up notification"" when things are out of your hand. So, I would suggest adding a simple health status monitoring system built inside.",4
8013,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,I don't care for planking..but i've had this app before...it seems to have gotten a bit better..intergrating a bit more tools to help reach weight loss goals. Continue tweaking and it will be a perfect app.,4
8014,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Amazing! On my first workout I really broke a sweat! But,the only problem is the workouts. They can be really challenging and even I couldn't do a few moves. I am a 10 year old child who is trying to lose weight but I think you pushed the exercises abit too far. Other than the workouts it's a really good app for weight loss. Good job developers!",4
8015,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"This app was quite useful for me previously, but I wonder if it's friendly to people with back problems, and if it would help them with their back problems, or if the current exercises not enough to do that. Thanks.",4
8016,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,I really love this app and l'm trying to lose some weight some times the work outs is a bit confusing but l only 12 years old trying my best l tryed home workout no equipment and did it for about a month or 24 days and l never noticed approvements but my family members did but overall its a good app for people who really wants to loss weight,4

8018,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Day 1 and feeling the burn. I like this app for beginners. Have my daughters wedding to go to in 6 months have to be in shape.,4
8019,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Excercise are precise and performable but timing inbetween is unrealistic, you can't switch that fast, just for attention grabbing, 5 mins exercise a day looks good but in real it should match latency of human to switch between exercises... Or it can be considered as intense cardio exercises but not for all, it'll be easy, for who are fit enough",4
8020,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Very comfortable experience, I feel a lot of confidence coming from this app! love it. Wish it felt more human though. Overall great experience!",4
8021,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Nice app! I love that I can keep track of my weight too. : ) The missing thing is that I cannot add custom names for exercises like BJJ or Fysio Training. If I have been to a BJJ training I can only add Wrestling for example. However nice app and easy to use üëçüèº,4
8022,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Nice exercise app. Very good free hand and diverse exercises.,4
8023,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Used for a week better than the subscription apps. Customize your own workout. Too early to see any results so far but I think eating right and this app I will be able to achieve my weightloss goal.,4
8024,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"This app is amazing, it's guided and you can expand on the exercise to see more details on how to do the exercise. The only issue is that of you leave the app by accident and go back into it mid workout, it corrupts the workout (exercises gets reset in terms of estimated calories, and the number of exercises becomes incorrect), Samsung's implementation of pop-up view does the same thing (using multi-star). Another minor irritation is that the done and skip button are too close together at times.",4
8025,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"The UI, Features and Time Tracking is really great and will for sure be of Help for Weight Loss/Muscle Gain.. However if the Ads didn't pop much then it would be perfect",4

8027,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,It is a good app for weight loss and it guids with many languages and it is use for weight loss bady fitness er,4
8028,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,The first few ones were hard but after a few days youll get used to it though i have to see what excersices looks like due to the picture and animation being a bit vague so over all 4 stars,4
8029,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Good for health and fit your body and this app was very nice and coll instructions do fallow and gain wait loss,4
8030,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,I have a suggestion about the water tracker. I love the water tracker option. It really helps remember to drink water. Except the notification makes this horrible sound of water that I can't keep the notification on at work. I fear the water reminder going off in a meeting or something. I use my phone alot so i will be able to see the notification. But can you please remove the splashing water sound. It's a very embarassing sound.,4
8031,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,It is very nice to use and the command really help to exercise but the rest timer should give 2 attempt of extra 20 sec otherwise people will increase however they want beside app is very good to use,4
8032,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Pretty good, and it can get intense to what i want. I would say that the calories you burn is probably way off. There is no way some workout burns almost 300 calories in 20 mins",4
8033,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,it is amazing I just only started using it so I haven't noticed any changes but it is already making me feel better I just fell like I need to loose weight and I want to loose weight it is already making me feel like a happy and healthy person,4
8034,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"The app is ok and works fine.It is showing 'rest day' but when I finished the day,my streak broke. Why the hell is this happening?",4
8035,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Timely and good sound. Exercises are well organized,4

8037,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"So far (2 days) the app is great, advanced workout is basically a 20 minute intense body workout set (17 exercises, with rest personally set, I set mine at 30 sec). Has a weight/bmi tracker and drink reminder, gives lots of helpful tips during the workout and when drinking. Only problem I find is I would like to be able to alter the water/drink notification sound, as I personally find it uncomfortable, but I can't find anywhere to turn it off without turning off the notification.",4
8038,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Awesomely brutal for a beginner. Great workouts. Let's keep going,4
8039,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"It's my first time, but I still vote as the best workout routine , I hope I see the results in a few days",4
8040,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,It is the most greatest app for your health but kinda makes you do a lot of exercises,4
8041,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Hello dev guys. I really like the app, just downloaded it today. I will keep testing it for 2 more days and then I'll buy the app to support your work. Something that I like to see in future releases will be the ability to stream your exercises from the app to the TV ( I have a Samsung one), that'd be fenomenal to have the exercises in a bigger screen. Thank you :)",4
8042,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Good exercises. The app starts fat blokes, like me, off with a program that doesn't put you off coming back the next day. Fully customisable, allowing you to change any exercise with another. Only issue I have with it is when you complete the last exercise it cuts to an advert before actually letting you know the exercise has ended. ***Edit for devs*** I wasn't complaining about the ads. I was suggesting that the ad begins after the app advises completion of the set",4
8043,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Good for providing a regular semi-tailored workout. The ads are bit intrusive and annoying though. Hence the 4 star.,4
8044,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,In this time I will give 4 stars because it's so much great app is this and its free and don't waist your money on other applications and they are charges very large that's why I m using all parts of this app.and if I completely changed my body so after than I will give you 5 stars fully ‚ú®‚ù§Ô∏è,4
8045,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"The app interface is pretty easy to understand and the excersizes are really good. My only major complaint is that it only synchronizes with Google Fit, but because I use a Fitbit, my excersizes don't go across. There is also the fact that the rest days aren't automatically ticked off, and I lost my month long streak thanks to that, but that's minor.",4
8046,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Love the app and I'm definitely seeing results! However, as I live in an apartment I sometimes have to chose the low impact option (for overweight/people with injuries) as I cannot disturb my neighbours downstairs so I'm unfortunately missing out on some workouts (jumping, skipping etc). It would be great to choose the activities you can actually do and then the app create a workout plan around this?",4
8047,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"I only just started with the program, so I can't say how effective it is, but I can feel the impact it has on my body quite quickly. Didn't know 30 minutes can do that. I would like the option to ""rewind"" an exercise if I started wrong, or something interfered with the exercise. Definitely considering buying the full program, haven't made my mind up just yet.",4
8048,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Amazing up for everyone who wants to stay in shape or lose weight! I give it four stars because I think it would be even better to be able to add glasses of water for previous days (in case we forgot to do it). It would also be useful to see under each day of your program the date of that day (ex. Day 12 - March 25th). Overall the app is lit! üî•,4
8049,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,This is a very useful app for me because I can easily get fit without equipments and I relevantly say that I dot fit also although I am using this app since 1 month.......,4
8050,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"This app is pretty cool, I haven't had it for long so I can't say if it gives accurate results or not after the 30 days but it's reliable for a quick exercise every day and it keeps track of everything for you and you can set reminders and forge your own specific workout. If you want to get some daily exercise and loose some weight I suggest right here.",4
8051,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Great app overall, well designed. The adds are not intrusive and does offer a paid option to remove them. Workouts are good and have an okay variety but, more variation would be welcomed. While this is a 30 day program, it's best used for 90 days, going from beginner > intermediate > expected. Because of this, true couch potatoes might have a less than fun time starting at intermediate. Lastly, this app should really be paired with a cardio trainer and calorie counting app for best results.",4
8052,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Great app for office working professionals who wish to start getting into habbit of working out. Only 1 Con, since you might not know how to correctly do the exercises or get confused with their name, hence need to check on application which reduces your time to get into position.",4
8053,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,for a free app this is pretty good. It allows you to adjust for the level of intensity you need. it offers a variety of exercises that makes it interesting and it's not too demanding. At least if you select the beginners level like me. It does have ads but they're not overly intrusive. I don't know if it has all of the bells and whistles like support for third party music like some do but I'm actually pretty impressed with this thing and I'm glad I got it.,4
8054,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Good app, eases you in to the program and let's you adjust it as you go. I wish they would add an option for wind down stretches. 5 days in a low impact beginner program and I am already seeing some changes to my flexibility stamina and mood. They do recommend a low calorie diet, would love if it had some suggestions even as a paid option.",4
8055,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Really enjoying this so far. The exercises are good, the diagrams/videos helpful, and it's really a decent workout! The only thing I wish it had though, is a way to add notes for different days. For example, I skipped my workout yesterday in favor of a 7 mile hike. Would be nice to be able to add that to the history so it doesn't just look like I skipped a day for no reason!",4
8056,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Good app to keep you working. Has all round exercises that changes every day to target different areas. Enhancements needed. One, change of exercise from one to another has 10 sec break that is not sufficient if your next exercise is to stand while previous one was lying down or other way round. Hurrying up may cause injury. Second, when it is counts rather than time bound, the app shall also give counts. Now you have to manually tell the app that you are done which breaks your rythem.",4
8057,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,I think the app is gorgeous and well laid out .. pretty easy to use and done well to put an option for those with injuries or those with limitations. Followed the workout set out following my abilities and for me it was up and down but that is not due to the workout was more around my lifestyle. Especially the best feature is getting to make ur own workouts although the only issue i have is maybe there could be more exercises in the list to cover whole body including stretching.,4
8058,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Very good and correct but the price us to muc,4
8059,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,This is a pretty good app and i have used it multiple times so it has progressed very far. I find the animations nice but it would be better if you could see it with one extra perspective because before these wprkouts i have to check how to do each one beforehand. And ad placements have become much better so atleast i wont have an ad between a workout. Keep up the good work,4
8060,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Gr8 app. It would be an immense improvement if the app could allow the user to add excercises to the app generated plans. This way one can include warmup excercises at the beginning of each routine or customize the plan to suit the user. Of course one can customize the routine thru the ""my training"" option but it consumes lot of time to prepare a customized daily plan this way. Another great feature would be to integrate a calorie counter with the app.",4
8061,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,I have tried a lot to find the best exercise app for me. But this is the perfect one pls people try it out,4
8062,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Good app iv been using just over 2 months and lost a stone. Would be better if after 30 days you didnt have to go back to day 1 as I'm on advanced. Also would prefer if there was more pushup exercises but over all it's a really good app does what it says on the tin. Can definitely notice a improvement in my fitness.,4
8063,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,personally I like the app if you like challenges this is the place,4
8064,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"In a very limited scope, the app and it's UI/UX works very well. It is highly focused on strengthening. I really like the included water and weight tracker, but there is no way for me to add or track cardio to the training plan.",4
8065,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Im currently trying the app and on my second day. All I can say is that it really works on your target area, the one thing that it lacks for me is the part where the app helps also you to stretch before going through the regimen for the day since stretching is also important to keep you from injury. I think including stretching in the regimen will do more work on your target area since the stretching will prepare you for it. Also, try to look into your diet which can boost the effects. Thanks",4
8066,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Brilliant app. The exercises are well presented easy to follow.. Only criticism is could not easily find out how to switch between levels (e.g. beginners to intermediary) so had to remove then reinstall. Apart from that no issues. App is a great motivator to perform exercises. Like the daily reminder alerts and creatvyiubown program feature..,4
8067,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"I love the app. It's helpful and easy to use. The workouts are quite effective but the only problem that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is how there are no warm up exercises and telling a user to do warm up exercises before the workout is not the proper way because some users may be completely new and have no idea what to do for warm up exercises. But overall, the app is great and is a must-have if you want to lose weight",4
8068,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Started using app about 2 months ago, very good until in week 2 it just packed up, so I reloaded and started again. Today it's packed up again, the screen just goes black when you try to open the exercise bit, the water intake part was still ok. So today should have been day 19 of month 2. I have reloaded the app again, so wait to see how long it will work this time.",4
8069,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,I've skipped a few days so I still can't say exactly how good the app is but the owner was kind enough to reply to my review so it gets another star added. I might suggest it to some friends,4
8070,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Good. But just know that NO app can help you lose weight without you taking up a healthy diet as well. That being said, the workouts are quick, I always manage to break a sweat, they change up nicely, really seem to focus on your belly, and I like the work/rest schedule. 14 days in to the 'advanced' and it's very difficult but I'm sure it will ramp up.",4
8071,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Great app but once you've completed a 30 day cycle, it doesn't reset your progress, making it hard to keep track of your progress when restarting as all of the days remain highlighted as if they are completed. The only way around this seems to be uninstalling the app and downloading it again.",4
8072,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,It is literally an amazing app. I started the exercises regularly according to the instructions given and within just 6 days I was able to see a difference in my body shape. The only thing which is being lacked by this app is that it should also give some useful tips for our diet as a good diet would maximize the results. üëçüëç,4
8073,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"This app is highly useful for a weight loss guide although, I do fine the water drinking reminder tedious to use as When I click on the drink button, it would open the app itself which would take too long to load. I know I can turn off the notification but it would be nice to have it on but if there is a way to just click the notification and filling in the drink metre without having for it to actually open the app itself, that would be grand.",4
8074,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Early days so far, seems to be a good app for learning back to basic exercises. The adverts are a pain but the main problem is I find there is not enough time after each exercise to get ready to position yourself correctly for the next exercise. They only allow 10 secs which I believe they should give 30 sess, just to allow you to get you into the correct position.",4
8075,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"This app is great. I started workout after 20 years and enjoyed with this app. One suggestion, the customised option should have unjumble options for daily routine. Example. I have selected 15 exercises as customised plan but the sequence should change for these exercises every day. By doing this body isn't directly prepared for one after another.",4
8076,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Just started. Pretty short workout, but need to start somewhere.",4
8077,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"it really worth it, workouts are great. they might seems simple but it's good",4
8078,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"To bring down the intensity on my joints and burn more body fat, I spread the exercises throughout my day by doing only one execise per hour. The app has good exercises but no built-in warm ups and cool downs. I followed the whole program for a month but it was too much even on the beginner/easy level. Too much meaning my shoulders, one elbow and my knees hurt a little, and when I finished the month I didn't use the app for about six weeks.",4
8079,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,It's a good app. It could have been even better if it could show us how to correctly do exercises as well.,4
8080,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,The app is so efficient because it gives you steps and exercises you need to follow to achieve your desired goal,4
8081,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"It's a okay app but lacks a lot of variety. It's basically just as easy to watch someone do it on YouTube, plus the ads were a little wonky. I had opened the app and a ad played but the app shut down and so another ad had to play when reopening it.",4
8082,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"I installed it long back. It may have been 2 years or so. Everytime I started off with colossal enthusiasm. Nonetheless, I could never complete the 30 days workout plan. It happened several times. Once even went till the 22nd day but again something happened and as usual stopped again! Finally, a month ago I decided to give it a last & sincere try. So, I started the intermediate  plan. Alongside I cut off sugar, oil & carbs from my daily intake. So, after 30 days I have lost 2.5 kgs. It works!",4
8083,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Works well. I just finished the 30 day Intermediate plan. During the first two weeks I kept eating normally (Spaghetti and ice cream for dinner) and my weight actually increased by two kilo. Then I went on quite a strict diet for the rest of the time and I lost about three kilo (meaning I lost 1 Kilo overall). But I feel a lot better and I also look better in front of the mirror. The app keeps you motivated really well. One star less for an absurd amount of advertising.,4
8084,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"I've been using the advanced routin for the past 26 days, so I've got four days till completion. As for the result, I lost about 5 kgs, and i would say this app contributed about 30% to it as i've been doing other things as well. This app alone won't get you wonders as weight loss is a long journey and requires many things, but what it will do is give you proper discipline and guidance. This is the first stepping stone to your amazing journey. Don't give up!",4
8085,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Good app and simple to use. I really like the remainder system it has. If I could change/add something, it would be a timer on when you do crunches or push ups to keep the momentum going. Also having the ability to access my music through the app would be really helpful.",4
8086,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"I love the app everything about it is perfect, but just one bug, the reminder doesn't work, hence the four stars. I DID allow every permissions it asked for and even checked everything from the phone settings. I just couldn't figure it out and I hope this is fixed in future updates.",4
8087,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Adds are out of the way. Water notifications can get old, but are necessary. It shows you how to do the positions in a little animation. Would give 5 stars if the voice wasn't so robotic, but outside of that personal experience there are ads but none during the workouts at the moment. Great app!",4
8088,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"This is a very good exercise app, but I would definitely say it is a 'core workout' rather than a 'fat loss' program. It certainly gets your blood pumping. Thankfully I have experience with calisthenics. If you're a complete beginner, you might struggle to achieve good form on some of the exercises.",4
8089,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Amazing app! But you should add a setting for people with back problems like me, it hurts me a lot to do some things, most I can push through but reverse crunches really get me and I cant keep my back to the floor, so a setting like that would probably help a lot of people, other than that the app is AMAZING",4
8090,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Great app overall. It does promise unrealistic results in 30 days but it keeps you accountable and helps track progress so you stay motivated. Warning: Not all days/workouts are balanced. Occasionally it will put multiple ab/core exercises in a row which is difficult and less effective than spreading them out evenly.,4
8091,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Amazing app, great animation of exercises that shows you how to perform the movement. Easy to follow which workout you have to do and clearly lists every exercise. Also 100% free. Cons: should have a calendar option and a running feature that allowed you to set up a custom running workout or track your rund.",4
8092,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"1st December, 2020- This app is perfectly made. But I rated it 4 star because it doesn't give me any option of syncing with fit bands. Please give this option, it will help us tracking our progress more accurately. Please add this option then i will definitely take 5 stars. I have already post a e-mail to your feedback section.",4
8093,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,only been using for a day or two. Great plans and easy to use. just wish some of the exercises had better pictures/better descriptions. I'm unfamiliar with some of the exercises and dont want to hurt myself. but besides that small issue the app is great,4
8094,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Really great app. Very motivating and thorough. I am currently following the 30 days and am on my fifth day. Unfortunately my streak got broken because I didn't know you had to log and click ""Finished"" on the rest day. Would be great if you can go back and change that so that the streak wouldn't be broken. But overall great experience",4
8095,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Liked that it's has timed it intervals and automatically sequences through most exercises. I would like it if you eliminate the rep sets and to just have all of the excercies timed so I don't have to manually tell it I completed a set in order for it to go to the next excercie e.,4
8096,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"All around decent. Good variety. I wish there was an option to purchase the and remove adds. I also wish that it had an option to sync to S Health. Google Fit is cool and all, but anyone with a Gear or Galaxy watch can't take advantage of it.",4
8097,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Great workout app to start with if you are a beginner. It has good combinations of exercise, which won't exhaust you completely or cause any injury. For performing the exercises one don't require much space, could be done in a hotel room also. Giving four stars because personally didn't like advertisement popping before ending every session.",4
8098,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Good app. I really don't understand why I can't seem to use it a second time? I want to start again but it seems it only works for 30 days once and after that you can only replay certain days and not start again. Weird as I would have given more stars if this worked. *Update, I managed to sort the issue, great app.",4
8099,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"I think this app would have been better if after finiahing a sesion of training, after selecting a higher level, all the exercises would change (time and number of repetitions), not only the number of push-up and the time of planking. I hope for an update that will make thia app better.",4

8190,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"I really love this app. It contains a nice set of exercises which gave me good results after a month and a half of constant usage. The only shortcoming I recently discovered is that there should be a setting to pause the workout plan that can be used when someone is really sick. It's a little annoying to see ""don't give up notification"" when things are out of your hand. So, I would suggest adding a simple health status monitoring system built inside.",4

No annoying ads while you're doing the workout. If you're unsure how to do a certain exercise. It has youtube videos in the app to show you exactly how it's done. It keeps track of the duration of your workout, calories burned, weight, BMI, exercises during workout, and you can sync to google fit. And best of all, it's free.",5
8201,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"I didn't use this app as intended with customizable workouts. However, I used its graphing portion that shows you how much weight you've lost or gained in the month. Just putting daily inputs in and constantly looking at it pushed me to eat less junk and work out. So I can confidently say in the last year I have lost close to 75 pounds.",5
8202,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"This app is currently helping me drop a bit of weight tbh, its nice and simple for us guys, it has plenty of adjustable options, so if your in an apartment, there are quiet but effective exercise routines, and there are skip options if there are just exercises you don't think you can do, But you can! If you get this app all the exercises are so able just believe in yourself!",5

I prefer weights only but this is such a good experience. All their apps link up to Google Fit too and I also do 45 minute walks from work which add to it. It slowly gets you back into the habit of working out and yes this app can get you sweating/cussing! But if you're just laying around, do a 12 minute workout, there are great guides and someone talking you through it along the way. (Optional) üí™",5
8204,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,325lbs to start. I am halfway through the intermediate and the progressions are perfect for me. It keeps getting harder but I am still able to manage. I am super pleased with the simplicity and layout of this app. When I get up in the morning there is no guess work required and it tells me exactly what I need to do. I haven't lost much weight yet but I can see my body changing already and I'm sort of getting obsessed with the results. I use Cronometer app alongside for my nutrition goals. Great!,5
8205,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"As a 6 ft, 275 lb, 37 year old, incredibly unfit male, this app is a great. It starts off with your choice of difficulty and time. Break times between exercises can be increased or decreased based on what your heart and other muscles can handle. There are ads. But they are placed in non-annoying places. After a week of using this app on its default settings on Intermediate skill, my back is no longer in pain. This is most definitely a 5star app",5
8206,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"I've used this app for a little over 6 months now and I do enjoy it. I use it now as a warmup, but I remember starting the beginner set and barely being able to breathe after. I lost a little over 60 lbs in 6 months. You do need to pair it with a good diet and I started doing more cardio as I got more fit. That said though, this app serves great to build a foundation for keeping a consistent fitness schedule and I'm very happy with the results. Going to keep using it for continuous improvement.",5
8207,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Easy to use. Does come with 3 to 10 second ads in between menu options but there is an option to pay 5 bucks to remove them. Honestly I wouldn't pay for it because the ads are 3 to 10 seconds and don't happen during the workout. Make sure to follow the exercises and don't alter. I ran intermediate for my first workout and was having trouble breathing after so I upped the break from 10 seconds to 15 until I can breath better after the exercises gonna bring it back down to 10 then hopefully 5.,5
8208,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Good app that helps set reminders to exercise, and caters the exercises to your difficulty/ability. You also set your height and weight to give an approximate BMI, and track your weight each day to show progress. My only complaint is some ads cause the app to crash, which can mean having to restart the app once or twice before actually getting to the exercises.",5
8209,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"This app certainly is not for everyone. The thing I really like about this is there is a women's version and a men's version with different exercises. I believe both male and female can do either one of them and find aerobic exercise within. But you can adjust in the men's for things like knees being bad or stuff like that, but you can't do that in the women's. The women's can target areas, have a fast exercise, and target weight. Some great options",5
8210,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Honestly, I'm loving my experience on the app, its very simple, easy to use and get going, and the coach type aspect of it has gotten me moving, its a great app and I'm very thankful for it, or else I wouldnt be working out at all. So, thank you, the only inconvenience is that theres an add every time i add a glass of water, and its minor, like half a second ad you can instantly click off of, It barely affects anything so again, thank you.",5
8211,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Excellent app for those trying to shave off those extra pounds. Especially in the midst of covid, a lot of us were house bound, and put on more pounds than we would like to talk about. This app gauges your fitness level from the get go, the tailors the level you need to be at. I have yet to be disappointed, I'm always working up a sweat everytime I finish a workout! You owe it to yourself to get in shape!! Plus you can't beat such an app that doesn't make you pay for it.",5
8212,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,The app is great but when you serve ads and disable the close or skip button that seems to be a violation of the personal agreement. We agree to view your ads for potential purchases not to have some video forced upon us. Please reconsider this policy and serve ads that are truly optional. Gotta go for five stars. They actually listened and have me the opportunity to discuss my thoughts. Plus the close buttons are working. Great company. Great app.,5
8213,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"I like the clarity and simplicity of the work outs, there are three different levels that are perfectly fit for either beginners, intermediate, or advanced. It also has a optional way to record your weight ( a powerful motivation), a clear display of how many calories you will burn with any particular regimen, and a clear visual of the work out with helpful audio tips so you get the most out of your workout, all on all, I give it five stars.",5
8214,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"To get the full effect of how helpful this app is. You have to couple it with another good workout plan. I did 30 minutes of either elliptical, running, jogging, or agility training. Then 5 reps and 8 sets of whatever workout I was doing. Then finished with this. Cool down after all this was a walk. This app helps organize and motivate what momentum you've already established.",5
8215,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Great app for an old, overweight and unmotivated man as myself. It only takes 5 to 7 minutes in beginner mode but that has helped me feel better and I've started to lose weight in two weeks (cutting way back on sugar too). I just tell myself I can do it as poorly as I like, it doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to happen. C'mon if you can't spare 6 minutes a day you're not being honest with yourself. App gives coaching advice for posture as you do the exercises, simply awesome!",5
8216,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Highly recommended. Easy to choose your level of fitness. Ads are not annoying like most apps. Look forward to sticking with it. Update! I'm starting my fourth month, at 91 sessions, and I've lost over 15lb. Noom is a huge help with mental dieting too. But I couldn't be anymore happier with what I've achieved with this app. I don't believe you can do it 30 days. But you can most definitely do it if you stick with it. Plus its awesome having core strength. You can never overdose on planks. üí™",5

I haven't been able to stay on schedule as well as app calls for so it took me 3 months to do 2.5 months. Feels like my head is going to burst somedays, as some of these exercises are extremely difficult. Haven't really lost weight but most definitely feel better and have more sculpture.",5
8218,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Updated to 5 stars, started using it a while ago and got out of the rhythm (health reasons) having a widget for reporting water intake would be awesome as this takes a bit of time to load on my device. Update: I'm not expecting miracles I know I'm a big stationary guy... but I am seeing some steady weight loss, app is easy to use and seems to be perfect for what I can do with limited equipment at home. Here's to seeing what the rest of the month brings",5
8219,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Just downloaded and completed the first day workout. A decent but simple reminder that just a small amount of effort can lead to great results. The app starts by asking about your personal fitness with a few easy questions, and then is ready to let you start immediately. The robot voice helping to count off time and assist with the next exercise makes this a lot easier to do.",5
8220,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Simple, easy to use, customizable, and I really feel like the workouts are doing something.

Edit: The app is working really well. I like that the app keeps changing things up and adding length to the usual ones. I've changed my diet once I started using this app while also mostly fasting on my days off. Two weeks in and I've dropped around 10 pounds,5
8222,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Great app for free body exercises. It has got some flexibility with excercise interval time, water intake measure, videos showing correct way to perform the task in hand (super useful for amateurs like me), coutdown before the next task starts (audio and video both), some audio explanation about the exercises how they help (very nice). Would have appreciated more if there was some flexibility about the countdown timer, when i want to hear. Great exercises which really shows results.",5
8223,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Great App and great workout plans. It even allows me the ability to edit the workouts as needed for possible weaker muscles or old injuries. The app is customized to your skill level and equipment available. This app also allows me to set up my own customized workout plan. I would recommend this app to anyone I know trying to start exercising and lose weight.,5
8224,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Good workout under an app that keeps you accountable. Yes, there's ad but that's how they generate $$ so don't act entitled and help them out a bit. Everytime I finish my workout I just click on the top right(lightning symbol) to open an ad, the rest of the time it doesn't bother me. I dont know about beginner or adv but I've been doing the intermediate 2x consecutively and it makes me sweat.

8226,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"I really like this app. I bought the app to do away with ads. I've used this app for two weeks, and I used the same company's ab workout app for a month, and I have lost five pounds (my goal is 15), and my core strength has improved considerably. I like how there are different levels of strenuousness. I've been on intermediate, and I think I'll go up another level in March. I like almost all the exercises, and for the few I don't like (like jumping jacks and sit-ups, I just sub in. Five stars!",5

After the FIRST DAY, I could notice my biceps(I think that's what there called) growing and I could do push-ups way better in which before I could do like two and feel weak. Now I can do more than six! And remind you this is after One day of progress.

Doing the beginner's course I am challenged every day, right up to my limit but never to the point where I cannot do it, even as the exercises become more challenging. And a little over two weeks into the program I am already making progress that I can feel. I just wish they didn't show an ad directly after your workout, that little applause sound it plays is surprisingly motivating but you don't get that when there's an ad in the way.",5
8230,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Fitness on the cheap. Easy to use app that allows the user to set difficulty. No excessive advert intrusion. Visual images assist. Early days so unclear as to whether it will bear results but enjoying the exercise. Calendar helps provide motivation.,5
8231,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,Still really happy with this app. I've been using it on and off for a few months and I consistently feel well worked out after a session. I pair a 20 min workout with a run each morning and I've lost about 20lbs quite easily. One negative is the ads but they're not too intrusive and.domt.interrupt workouts.,5

8237,menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen,"Great amazing app, I definitely noticed a difference when using the app. Although i do have to say that the voice can be quite disturbing sometimes, I would defo suggest using both a male and female human voice option like some other apps. Lastly, the option for a calm voice or shouting voice would be good as an option for communities like gym community and yoga community, etc. Other than voice issues, it's great.

I wouldn't mind if it was only a few but that's actually crazy.",1

The app has confirmed that it is a lot, even on a slow day, so sure, it did what I expected. The problem is with the notifications from the app chastising me for failing to meet my 'goal' during the time that I literally didn't have the app. Even if I had had the app and took zero steps, it is appallingly gross to program something theoretically intended as a fitness aid to shame the users.",1

The monthly totals don't equal the sum of the daily totals for that month. For example, when I manually add the daily totals listed for September, I get 301,809. But the app says the monthly total is 281,844. It's been under for every month I've checked. Update: despite the developers saying it would be fixed, the problem continues. Don't waste your money in this app.",1

But then, in February 2022, it started eating up mobile data like there was no tomorrow. I turned off background data usage permissions and thought that might alleviate the problem, only to find in March that it somehow had managed to circumvent this and again ate up 579MB of background data usage -- and it's only the middle of the month.

Since the last update that changed the design a little bit, my app says ""Yesterday"" for the current day, and every day going back is also off by one.

I have turned off all the notification settings in the app, but unless I block notifications at the OS level, it insists on showing me steps, calories, distance, and minutes and will not let me swipe it away.

Accupedo has that luxury so I could pause without opening app, but that app always tends to stop counting steps after a while and does not automatically calculate step length based on height (Automatically based on height is a luxury I love having, removes the extra work and time required to calculate step length).",4

Hi guys I have had this app downloaded for a while and suddenly I cant get it to work anymore. It doesnt seem to stay active and count my steps anymore,5
9432,com.stepsappgmbh.stepsapp,this app count correct but it is paid.

9441,com.stepsappgmbh.stepsapp,"So far I really like it. Basic yes but thats what i wanted. It gives all i need and i can see charts for day, week and month. Im going to try it for a month and if it works well, ill definitely buy the ad-free version.",5

9614,com.gymshark.fitness,Love this app great workouts My only 2 points would be that it would be good to have a timer that beeps at you when the time limit for the exercise is up also would be good to have the ability to change exercises in workouts so if you don't like sit-ups you can have 2 or 3 options you can swap out and have the ability to save them to that workout,5
9615,com.gymshark.fitness,"I love the app, especially where it lists all the different movements for each muscle group - found that really useful when writing up all my own plans and gave me some great ideas throughout lockdown when gyms were closed. I did unfortunately lose all my saved plans so deleted the app and then reinstalled hoping they might reappear (probably made it worse). But it's a great app for both beginners and those who are experienced üòä",5
9616,com.gymshark.fitness,This App couldn't be any more perfect for me if it tried.

An nice addition would be an option to copy a premade workout/plan, and then be able to edit instead of creating a plan from scratch.

9622,com.gymshark.fitness,"Good workouts (most of them). And one of the best apps to track your own personal workouts, pretty good! But they need to add the option to save workouts or plans, it's really exhausting to look for them every single time. If they add that I'll give the app 5 stars",5

9800,com.the.pump,"I've been using The Pump since April, and this is the first program I've stuck to in 20 years. It's also the first program where I've had to look at my partner and say ""You seeing this?"" as the changes have been impressive to say the least. Having a program that is created without your input might seem daunting, but it really helps with getting the workout in since there's no choices, just do what is listed for the day and record your sets. It's far better than the choice paralysis others give.",5
9801,com.the.pump,"This app has been very useful. Great workouts, great tracking of workouts, excellent support from one of the most supportive and uplifting communities, a rarity in the mobile internet era, and the main drivers of the app are incredibly knowledgeable and supportive of the app and the community. There are some things from a user perspective still being worked on, but one of the best apps I have downloaded. Thanks Arnold, Daniel, and Adam!",5
9802,com.the.pump,"Perfect fitness app for me. Plans from beginning bodyweight to more advanced with dumbbells and/or gym equipment. The app is supposed to be simple, get in - get out to minimize time in front of screens which is perfect for me. It tracks your progress and I've been killin' it for a few months. The progress is visible and the positivity of the village second to none. Support from the developers has been fantastic as they want to produce a stellar, simple, no Bovine Scat product.",5

The developers are very transparent on things they are fixing and what features we will see in the future. I am very excited to see how this app and everyone using it grow! The workouts are great.

9804,com.the.pump,"I'm not exactly a beginner but have been out of practice long enough that I signed up for the beginner workout anyway. It's working for me. I love the simplicity of focusing on building a routine for the first months of the program, and that there are instructional videos with each exercise. There are bodyweight options for those who don't have equipment. The other thing I love is the very encouraging, positive approach in the articles posted to the app. It keeps my motivation up.",5
9805,com.the.pump,"Great app, especially for a version 1 release . Gets me motivated to workout knowing a new workout is waiting for me. Sometimes I have to substitute a workout for another one because of equipment limitations like Lunges for Leg Extensions, or Dumbbell Kickbacks for Tricep Pulldowns. Being experienced I don't have a problem doing this and know to substitute an isolation movement for another but a beginner might get frustrated.",5
9806,com.the.pump,Fantastic experience so far. I've been using app since its inception and it has been very impressive. Love that they are constantly working on making improvements.

As a mom, a volunteer FF/EMT, and an IT consultant, decision fatigue is real. I love this app, and I mean LOVE with all my donut fueled heart, because it takes all the work out of working out. The routines are set, the exercises are beautifully well described and scheduled, and it's well designed. It has EVERYTHING you need to build better habits. DO IT.",5

10200,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,"Great little app. Major pluses: very customisable, easy to use, good range (over whole body) and cheap as chips! Great for those that find it hard to find a challenging routine that they actually like as this one you can 100% choose all the exercises, their order and duration. Down sides: limited to between 10 and 20 exercises (can choose duration though) per routine.",4
10201,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,"I love this app, but I wish it had an option to remove exercises from the workout. I have some injuries which mean that I cannot do some of the exercises and they are always the ones that pop-up in the workout and then I have to skip and I feel like I haven't done the proper workout",4
10202,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,I own the full version which is supposed to allow you to customize workouts. It's frustrating that some exercises won't cross over out of Pilates or Kettle Bell. Ex: you can't add Supermans unless you are in Pilates. Please consider changing this in the next update.,4
10203,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,"Good. The voice is too monotone, gets boring. Would be nice if 10 sec warning or some motivation as doing each exercise. Good exercise options though.",4

10206,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,Great app but wish you create more than just 1 custom routine.,4

10209,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,this is a good quick ab workout,4
10210,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,Seems great so far,4
10211,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,"I love it! It's a great and simple app, and now it works with Google Fit! (Edited: not working with Google Fit anymore)",4
10212,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,"The ability to skip some moves, due to injury or something, and have new ones subbed in would be great. I can't bend my wrist right now, so planks and such are out and to get a full workout I have to start again.",4
10213,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,I rated this app for the first time in 2015 and I am still using it. I still wish they would update and change things up. use this app daily. I like that they just added a few new exercises as the old once are getting ......old ! Wish they update more often is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars,4
10214,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,good,4
10215,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,"One of the best fitness apps. Easy to use and does what it should do. Nevertheless, certain useful features such as length of transition pause / rest breaks and sound notification before the end of each exercise are missing.",4
10216,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,Excellent app one of the best for 40+ or the struggling universe. Perfect for the person with little free time. Each exercise tells you what muscles to contract during the exercise and unlike many more it doesn't make you feel like a failure for being unsuccessful with a set. I docked one star because the Nvidia Shield TV doesn't have the streaming videos on it and secondly cloud save would have been brilliant. Despite these negatives easily worth the ‚Ç¨10 if not more.,4
10217,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,I love this app. It has tons of routines and it's very simple to use. The only suggestion I have is that they signal the end of each workout step. That would have made it at 5 star,4
10218,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,"It's nice for those days when I don't have time for a run but want to keep 
on track with a short work out. Really wish it had Cat Camel and I wish you 
could repeat an exercise within same workout.",4
10219,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,Transition between exercises is far too quick : 3 seconds! App needs to make this configurable by the user.,4
10220,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,"Overall very good. Logical grouping of exercises is great and the pairing of exercises in full body mode balances the working of muscle groups. Interface is also intuitive.  Would like to see the full range of exercises made availably in the full body custom mode (including pilates and stretching) to build complete workouts. Also like to see the ability to enable /disable the randomising of exercises in custom mode. Finally, like to see the 3 second timer between exercises made adjustable. With those additions, 5 stars. üôÇ",4
10221,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,"This app is brilliant! I use it every day for a warm up stretching routine and three more times each week for a full body workout. The ability to create and customise your own routines is fantastically useful, or simply run a random programme to mix it up!  Edit: Previous issue fixed with an update. 5 stars now!",4

10227,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,Pick two workouts get at it 10 minutes a day before I go to work.  I like it I do feel the app should recomend what equipment you should buy because it does say what to use while working out.  But still great app,4
10228,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,Love this app. I'm not great at making myself exercise but this this is so simple. I pick a different app everyday. Started doing 5 mins a day now doing 10. Brilliant app x,4
10229,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,"It's been a great app for targeting problem areas.  I would recommend it to friends.  I do still keep up with running, but when short on time I can do this in place of circuit training.",4
10230,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,Good app for quick 10 minute workouts.  The video and instructions are very clear and this app is so easy to use.  This app would easily be 5 stars if it would link to Google fit and the times for each workout could be extended.,4
10231,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,This app is great along with the new/added workouts like kettlebell and pilates but what I only want to request is to extend the pause between exercises. It's only 3 secs and please add a warning tone or a countdown for the next exercise position.,4
10232,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,"I like how this app help me target an area I want to strengthen or I can just do a full body workout. Also the pausing, rewind and skipping to the next exercise gives you a little custom to the workout.",4
10233,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,"Brilliant. Would be five star if only they made the full body workout for kettlebell the same as the other one. Meaning longer options than 10 minutes, I end up doing it twice...",4
10234,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,Would like to have the ability to change length of time between exercises to allow for longer breaks when using heavier weights. Overall great app and very easy to use,4
10235,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,"I have been using these apps forever, they are great! I do wish I could save custom workouts I build for more than just the one session, though!",4
10236,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,This is a nice app with video instructions for working out at home. There is a good variety of routines and lengths of work outs. The hardest thing is choosing what to do!,4
10237,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,Simple but powerful. The only changes I would suggest is some sound at the end of one exercise. Maybe a countdown for the last 3 seconds,4

10239,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,"Quick and easy, I would like a better calorie counter though. My best results came from this app!",4
10240,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,Great app. Awesome that there's exercises targeting different areas. More variety please?,4
10241,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,"I love the simplicity of this app and the exercises available,  but it does not save my selections for the custom sets. :(",4
10242,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,You can do these anywhere. Limited equipment required these are a great starting point for those looking to start body weight training.,4
10243,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,"I understand that it will take a while to learn the workouts, but the stretches on this app are not very complicated. Thanks!",4
10244,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,"Because of my job  have to travel quite a lot so I find it quite hard to join a gym. With this app, exercising is easy and you can do it almost everywhere!",4
10245,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,Great app but would be better if I could create my own  random workout from all the exercise choices without it having to be in the order dictated by the app,4
10246,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,Easy to customise to what you need. Easy instructions to follow. Download the full app for more extras. Very handy workouta where ever you are.,4
10247,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,I wish it would work with my fitbit app for enter my exercises. But it still is awesome!,4

10272,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,It takes just five minutes to feel your  heart / lungs beating seriously.,4
10273,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,I really like this app in the fact that it is flexible and has different areas you can really focus on. It is simple and does its job. I like to the point exercise. My ONLY complaint is I wish I could watch Netflix at the same time but that isn't all that important. :),4
10274,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,Ive only had it less than a week but I'm really enjoying all the variety of different exercise options and the explanation as to what those exercises work on. I did think that the full version would have more to it with regards to personal monitoring and goal setting.,4
10275,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,"This app doesn't necessarily help youu to build a significant amount of muscle, but it sure does help youu lose fat and tone up your body! Perfect app if you're trying to slim your tummy and work on your legs and arms. Helps me to keep in shape.",4
10276,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,Good for shorter workouts in the week.  Easy to use.  Some exercises a bit hard for beginners but can aspire to them.  Better if you could set longer times per exercise.,4
10277,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,"Only thing I would like is to be able to choose more than 10 exercises. I like that they added three places to save custom workouts, but if I could do a 10 minute workout of 20 exercises, that would be awesome.",4
10278,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,"Not bad and it is quite use for days you can't or are not going to the gym. Nice ab and cardio, especially if you do custom full workout and only choose to work two things for 30 mins.",4
10279,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,I love that I can do a full body work out in just ten minutes. I love the reminder it sends as well. I would like to see more variety in the workouts.,4
10280,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,It's nice when you're short on time and trying to crunch in a workout.  I have found some new exercises which are great for targeting different muscle groups.,4
10281,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,"I'm new to the idea of daily exercising, have little access to a fitness center, and am alone in the the quest.  This is great. In this stage I'm counting calories. I rated this a 4 because it doesn't calculate the calories correctly or allow a way t access the overall daily calorie burn without going through a set of exercises.",4
10282,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,"Can do workouts wherever, don't need a tv for videos. I like that you can select various workouts or create your own.",4

10291,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,It works! !,4
10292,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,Love this app. Would be great if it had an interval timer in between exercises. Its not very convenient to pause the app for a 30 sec breather after every exercise. Hope they will unlock the other exercises for  customers who bought the app before the updates instead of asking us to pay to unlock the other exercises.,4
10293,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,"I like the app, I have been using the free app for a few weeks but wanted to change the routine.  I bought the full app and still enjoy it.  Only drawback is that the custom workouts have to be ten exercises each, why?  It would be much better if I could create workouts of varying lengths.",4
10294,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,The excersice for ten minutes makes me sweat. Amazing app for working out at home. Only thing that sucks is paying for the app then having to pay for more excersices.,4
10295,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,But I wish that once I had payed I would have accessed the whole thing.. you get more training exercises options but you have to pay to access the stretching exercises,4
10296,com.tinymission.dailyworkoutspaid,I would gladly give 5 stars if I could cast to my TV via chrome cast. Please add with the next update!,4

10720,com.rainfrog.yoga,So far so good. Will post more after a few weeks of trial.,4
10721,com.rainfrog.yoga,"I like it, just wish there was an option to cast to my tv. As a beginner, it would help with learning the poses.",4
10722,com.rainfrog.yoga,Looks like it has useful reference and routine.,4
10723,com.rainfrog.yoga,"The variations of ocean, desert or mountain are great; the options meet your needs depending the type of flow, duration and difficulty level. I'm still on the beginner level but I'm hoping as I progress the app will challenge me. I'm not sure if there is a way to choose different music, I thought maybe the music was associated with the various environments but that does not appear to be the case.",4
10724,com.rainfrog.yoga,Really good app,4
10725,com.rainfrog.yoga,"I'm a beginner at yoga; this app is easy to follow, has a clean interface and nice relaxing music. The voice instructor is not robotic sounding as some other apps I've tried. It gives breathing techniques during the poses and also explanations for each pose once selected. The transition from one pose to the next seems to go extremely fast. If there were an option to slow down or speed up the pace, based on skill level this would be a 5 üåü app.. IMO. Still, by far the best yoga app I've tried.",4

10735,com.rainfrog.yoga,Great app. Good start to fitness routine,4
10736,com.rainfrog.yoga,Good app. Could do with a speed setting. Some beginner poses quite hard (e.g. headstand). Keeps saying right leg instead of left. But enjoyable and a generally good experience with the app.,4

10742,com.rainfrog.yoga,"As a total novice, it's a simple and intuitive app, though some of the pose switches are pretty rapid even on the beginner difficulty. Wasn't quite prepared for it! But that said I enjoyed it and will keep going with it!",4

10749,com.rainfrog.yoga,"It's a very good app,  but few improvements would make it the best one:  1. More practice types, available for purchase, subscription etc.  2. Ability to create personalized programs for advanced users, and set the time manually for every pose 3. Men-friendliness: it feels a bit girly to exercise exclusively with women (no offense), but possibly to choose a gender of the voice and poses coach would be appreciated.  Thanks!",4

10754,com.rainfrog.yoga,"It's good, however I feel it to be a little difficult as a beginner. The intermediate routines are more like advanced in my opinion.

10760,com.rainfrog.yoga,Nice app,4
10761,com.rainfrog.yoga,Love this app overall however the voice/practice could stand to slow down a bit during the sessions. As the session progresses it gets really quick which is difficult for beginners.,4

10770,com.rainfrog.yoga,"I am not very flexible, so not only has this app helped me relax, it also has helped with my flexibility!

10782,com.rainfrog.yoga,"Love this app. It's helped me get started with a few simple yoga sessions per week. I'd love if it integrated into Google Fit for fitness tracking. Also, the voice prompts for lowering the left leg always say right leg, which always pulls me out of the practice a bit. Other than those minor annoyances, it's almost perfect!",4

Different routines for different goals (power, cardio, flexibility) as well as difficulty levels and time options make this app shine. The voice guide is great, and the images are super helpful generally (sometimes hard to tell for some poses which leg is forward vs back). Sometimes guide mixes up its left/right as well. 5/5",5

10879,com.rainfrog.yoga,"gave 4 stars for usability and features, the 5th star was for value for money, quite cheap, no need to make further in app purchases, however further purchases are also not expensive.  However I installed the app on multiple devices and the in-app purchases don't transfer across, would be great if we could sign in with an account and do it that way. Illustrations are fantastic, i was skeptical at first thinking it would be more like the wii-fit yoga, but it is just as informative as apps that use HD Videos. I did the ocean workout found that there were sections where it moved through the poses way too fast, I'd just get into one pose, and it would already be onto the next one, but that might be just a matter of getting used to the routine.    I like the 30,40,60 minute workouts, would like to see 15 minute workout added to that, sometimes that's all you got. Taking costs into account, I think this app beats all the others I have come across, even some of the $200 apps, and the free ones I tried aren't worth bothering with.",5
10880,com.rainfrog.yoga,"This is a nice yoga app. It has clear pictures of the poses and good 
instructions during the exercise. You can select from a couple of exercises 
and preview them before you start. It also contains a list of poses with a 
good description. Unfortunately the app is not longer updated, but it is 
still worth the price. You can earn points or buy them so you can get other 
backgrounds during the exercises. Everything else is fully functional. I 
hope they will start working on the app again.",5
10881,com.rainfrog.yoga,"This app is so amazing. I love how it gives a little bit of every exercise you need, plus if you look into the descriptions of the poses, it tells you how to get into the pose and the health benefits. Just amazing. I feel better than I ever have because of this app. You can take it with you anywhere and share it with your friends. I love it!!! Definitely recommend worthy.",5
10882,com.rainfrog.yoga,"Great for those who have completed at least beginner classwork. I don't need a video to explain downward dog or plank. I need routines, good voice. This app is the first I've liked! Good amount of instruction mixed with time to hold poses and concentrate.",5
10883,com.rainfrog.yoga,I love the choices between length of practice and level from beginner to intermediate to advanced. This is an app that gets a lot of use because I can tailor it to my needs. Plus the flow is slow to start and then speeds up to one breath per move. Some days I will only do 15 minutes of the 30-minute practice but that's enough to help work out the kinks in the morning.,5
10884,com.rainfrog.yoga,"This is a great yoga app for the average person. I have been using it on 
and off for years. You can do short sun salutation workouts, or their 
desert, mountain, or ocean workouts, which are each set for 30, 45, or 60 
minute sessions. Also, you can set each workout to be at beginner, 
intermediate, or expert. Currently I do 30 minute intermediate, and find it 
is challenging for me. Clear instructions for a noob like me, no ads. One 
time purchase, and worth it. (I have bought it twice: once for ios and once 
for android.) I am pursuing yoga more intently but expect to get a lot more 
use from pocket yoga. Buy it!",5
10885,com.rainfrog.yoga,I used to love this app until the last update messed up with the guided voice. What I mean by that is the guided voiced would not do the transitions from pose to pose. It would skip the fist few seconds and then move on. It is really annoying! Please fix it!,5
10886,com.rainfrog.yoga,"This is even better than being in a yoga studio. As an absolute beginner, Pocket Yoga has guided my journey impeccably. Best of any workout apps I've ever found, the best yoga app by miles",5

10890,com.rainfrog.yoga,"This is the prefect go-to when I want to practice yoga, without searching through thousands of youtube videos. Ability to choose 30, 45, & 60 min workouts or a quick few sun salutation reps, this app is simple, explanatory and a great way to practice yoga.",5

I would agree that the pace may be too fast for beginners, but there is a pause button if you need it. And, it's rewarding when you realize you can finally keep up.

and off for years. You can do short sun salutation workouts, or their 
desert, mountain, or ocean workouts, which are each set for 30, 45, or 60 
minute sessions. Also, you can set each workout to be at beginner, 
intermediate, or expert. Currently I do 30 minute intermediate, and find it 
is challenging for me. Clear instructions for a noob like me, no ads. One 
time purchase, and worth it. (I have bought it twice: once for ios and once 
for android.) I am pursuing yoga more intently but expect to get a lot more 
use from pocket yoga. Buy it!",5

10999,com.rainfrog.yoga,"I love this app BUT I wish I could make my own workout with the poses. Otherwise, it's awesome!",5
11000,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Very good app overall. Excellent time burning app that does not run ads nor any of that play to win nonsense a lot of games do. The draw back is it does get repetitive and once you get to a certain point you basically can coast through the game with no real challenge that is assuming you know what you are doing and invested properly early on. On that note if you are new to the game it can get frustrating as you have to figure it out as you go . But that aside this game is worth playing .,4
11001,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Another good Kairosoft game. While very entertaining, it has a few areas of irritation. Characters only get a max of 10 years so if you have a favorite boxer, his career is over at that point, and you have to start over again with a new one. Items can be very limited and adds a new level of frustration when you are trying to develop skills faster. There needs to be a way to choose from a list of coaches in the beginning instead of being stuck with one default coach. Otherwise another good game!",4
11002,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Having fun with it overall. I guess my only complaint is how low the stat caps are, and there's never the right uncap item available when you need it. Other than that, I'm loving it",4
11003,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"It's an alright game, no ads, and no store, so you can't pay to play better, and it's a great time killer, totally worth the little i paid for it",4
11004,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"This is a fun game, pretty interactive and i dont really notice any time gating elements that are out of place or frustrating.",4
11005,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"I've played a bunch of these, and while I did enjoy my time playing, ultimately I was left disappointed. I would recommend waiting til they make a 2",4
11006,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Ngl I'm only leaving a review for the in game rewards. It is a solid game that does what it says in the description. It loses a star because fast mode isn't available from the start,4
11007,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Great game, very enjoyable first play through but as others said, there is room for improvement. Maybe a speed-up button once you reach new game+ so that waiting for the weeks to go by goes quicker. Another training session which focuses on Health? Very difficult to build that up without using items and doing so is tediously painful Trainer specific items would be good aswell I like the idea that maybe you could implement a ""a fighter has called you out/challenged you"" for your title",4
11008,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Game fun. Prices are a little nonsensical (often better to skip new builds), but just like all kairosoft games, it's good for hours of entertainment",4
11009,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Game is pretty strsight forward if you've played kairosoft games previously. Not sure what these other reviews are about TBH. Gameplay is pretty simple and i feel like stats/grading for stats etc arent really as important. Ive literally just been going fight after fight dumping points etc into each character and just winning everytime(in a lot of the cases - by the skin of my teeth). The game doesnt really feel like theres an end goal direction though.,4
11010,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"This gane is pretty good, I've played for a few days now and so far it's pretty solid. The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is that boxers start at 20 and retire at 24. Alot of people start younger and go until mid late 30's and some longer than that. Also I'd like to be able to not have to change weightclasses and just defend titles there but that might be a giant ask. Personally I'd say hold onto your 7 bucks until there's more features or a sale.",4
11011,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Very fun game but a little repetitive. The opponents could do with been stronger as its almost impossible for them to beat you. The career extension means I had one character a champion at 4 separate weights, which is a little outside the realms of credibility. Overall worth playing",4
11012,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,It's a good game. Very slow at first and the game mode + isn't easy if you've not figured things out. I'm on my 4th play through and the only thing I dislike is the character doesn't port over so you have to build boxers from scratch all over again.,4
11013,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Love the game, but you can't start in airplane mode, gets stuck at 90%",4
11014,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Just bought this game 2 days ago. Highly entertained. My tips, focus only on one boxer at a time especially on your first game.. build horizontally the gym cos you are only building up one boxer.. hoad all your items once your boxer reached it's category champion level.. so that when you start a new game+, you bring those items forward. Especially those that increase your skillsets max . Those can't be bought from the store",4
11015,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Heads up, this game does not cloud save but saves locally on your phone so if you delete it or change phones you will lose all data and saves. Otherwise this game is phenominal in their story series and addictive because they know how to control your brain lol.",4
11016,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"So far it's definitely a kairosoft game, but one issue. I'm not sure if it's something I'm not understanding or its a bug, but I can't place any of my outdoor facilities. It shows me where they can go and touching those spots does nothing",4
11017,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"it is a normal kairosoft game, nothing new for the mechanic. Game is about training boxers and buying facilities for said boxers. The boxers have 4 active years before retiring, this can be extended for around 5 years more by using items. A bit lacking in facilities and items usefulness, in the end all that matters is collecting smiley points from people and advertisement. There is also a bug that can let you fight final boss in only around 4 game years.",4
11018,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"This will feel familiar to fans of Kairosoft games, and is definitely a fun management sim style game. The graphics are cute and the gameplay simple. Occasionally it feels repetitive, but overall I have been enjoying it and I am certainly not normally a boxing fan.",4
11019,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Honest critique here. The good: it's entertaining. Similar powerup system to High Seas Saga. Good simple char designs. It's fun for like 10 minutes. Nice fitting environment. The bad: The economy is unbalanced. Shouldn't have to wait 5 minutes irl just for power ups. You need the power ups to make your guys stronger unless you train, which also depends on a different currency (Smiles). Basically you shouldn't have to spend currency when you already have to wait. Theres more but no room",4
11020,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Lots of fun, but the in game credit system makes it pretty much impossible to reach the peaks of what the game has to offer. If the credit system is made just a little bit better balanced this is a solid five star game all day.",4
11021,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Great game if you have lots of time. Not if you don't. Hard to figure out how to play it at first.,4
11022,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Pretty good game. But the income system didn't work for me. Huge investments needed and with A stats boxers i was having trouble with earning enough to upgrade my facilities.,4
11023,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"A bit of a 'Frank Bruno'. Lovable and ultimately good at what it sets out to do, just lacking the true greatness to be the best in the division. It seems to plateau out and progtession past a point becomes sluggish.",4
11024,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Boxers retire way too fast. Only get a short time to train them.,4
11025,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,I enjoy the game but there are some things in unbalanced but it is good to pass time. I like there is no paying to play would also be great to see against other people after the year.,4
11026,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Awesome simulator and management game. Matches are fun and exciting, only criticism is that resources could be a bit more generous throughout the game.",4
11027,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Pretty standard Kairo, but no need to worry about combos. The main action plays out like their baseball game where you observe and occasionally use points to coach. Lots of fun and new game + is 100% worth going thru.",4
11028,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Not as easy to maneuver compared to your other games. I hope there will be some updates to help the fluidity of the game. This would open up more possibilities! I would love an MMA type one eventually. Keep up the great work!,4
11029,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Entertaining game with a old school look to it.,4
11030,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Hmmm... It's a bit boring compared to all other Kairosoft games... can only train 1 boxer at the start and after a match, there's nothing to do but wait and watch until he recovers (tho it's only a short while).",4
11031,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Loved the game but to be honest expected more from kairosoft after games like Ninja village or grand Prix story just feels rushed like something is missing.,4
11032,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Awesome game. Just needs more in the after 10 years part. Also the fights never break 3 rounds. Would be cool to tone down the damage,4
11033,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"I really enjoy the game. I wish we could influence our boxers' aggressiveness during their fights. I like what the developers did too, just wish for a little more control during the fights.",4
11034,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Really fun and nailed game. No complaints really.,4
11035,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Drags a bit halfway through the first playthrough, but if you build well on your first run then new game plus is really fun. I reccomend having one fighter in all sponsorship gear to consistantly have 1.2 mill income. Then you can focus on other fighters for titles",4
11036,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Fun game but runs out of content fast. Your boxer caps in stats and you can gain boosts by winning fights in the different weight classes only once.,4
11037,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,It's good but they gap between your first and second boxer is too wide. Maybe I played wrong but by the time I got my 2nd boxer my first was ready to retire which really set back the funds.,4
11038,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,As a fan of Kairosoft I think this is top 5 of their games. However since Im an old boxer maybe Im not objective. 4 because there is need of some bugfixes.,4
11039,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,I was actually surprised by how much I enjoyed this game. It stands up well next to other kairosoft games and has plenty of replayability. Only gave it a 4 because I wish it was MMA story instead of just boxing but a great game overall.,4
11040,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Fun game, progression is really enjoyable. It is a little bit of a grind at some points, but overall very enjoyable.",4
11041,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,It's a fun game kind of wish sometimes that you would have the fast option immediately but it's a game to kill time with that's pretty fun,4
11042,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Not the best kairosoft game but love boxing so the story is right up my alley. The app will constantly crash during training sessions.,4
11043,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Not bad but the RNG can be pretty wonky. Guys with lesser skills in everything but stam and hp putting my fighters away with huge crits while my fighters forget what offense is.,4
11044,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Very fun! Loving it!,4
11045,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,The max +50 hp etc potions dont work. They cost a whole upgrade and then they don't work. Everything else great. Typical of a kairosoft game.,4
11046,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"It's a sim boxing game! It is a little slow, but did you really want to beat it so quickly? I am doing a Newgame+ now and still enjoying it.",4

11048,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Good offline game to kill some time.,4
11049,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Fun lil' game. I really appreciate that it isn't an in app purchase game.,4

11053,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Awesome aesthetic and fun gameplay, but for 5 stars I want to lock screen in portrait mode.",4
11054,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Pretty addicting. Played for two days straight and burned out but it was fun and there was more room to grow.,4
11055,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Nice game. It could be better by adding online or comparison to other players would be nice with extra goals,4
11056,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Been non stop playing this game. Having a great time. Would like maybe some more features but all in all good,4
11057,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Been waiting a long time. Solid game. However i refuse to use the default gym name, but i cant change it at all",4
11058,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Fun game. It's a nice change of pace from some of kairosoft's other big names, but it's still theirs. We'll done.",4
11059,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Great game, could be better with more potential boxers to train and more focus on the gym than the supplemental businesses.",4
11060,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Solid Kairosoft Game, doesn't tell you when the game ends so you can lose alot when you start a new game plus.",4
11061,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Great game but not being able to let coaches go adds huge monthly fees in game there can't be removed. Please let us fire coaches!,4
11062,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Fun, but seems a lot more limited or lack of variation compared to their usual games.",4
11063,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Game is really really fun until near the end giving opponents 200% more punching damage where they outright drop you in a hit,4
11064,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Love the game, however there are some bugs. Why do the uncaps not work? It's supposed to give +50 into a stat and it does nothing.",4
11065,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,All these games become like an addiction.....I love it...reminds me of when I played a computer game with baseball players in the same style many years ago,4
11066,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Pretty cool game, little less options than many other kairosoft but it's mostly straightforward and plays well.",4
11067,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Another great game from Kairosoft. Lacking a bit compared to others in their sporting categories.,4
11068,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Needs more boxers and areas. Big issue with the rewards since they either get bugged or don't show more items,4
11069,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Still not the Cargoship game. But this will do for now. Translation team please release an English version of that too.,4
11070,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Very good game. There's a few bugs that need to be ironed out but overall a pleasant experience,4
11071,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Fun, but frustrating. Repeat play rewards aren't what I had hoped for",4
11072,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Very fun game! I enjoy watching my fighters grow, the training, surprises. Very cool sim.",4
11073,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Very fun but wish there was combos for gym equipment boosts.,4

11075,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,It's pretty fun without the need to constantly pay attention,4
11076,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Good game with fun animations but can get slightly repetitive,4
11077,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"I love this one, although it is bad in the ways that every kairosoft title is.",4
11078,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Good fun, a time sink for when you have some spare",4
11079,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,I like the game but I really wish I could speed through the matches.,4
11080,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,It's very fun and I could play for days but I think they should make a mma version,4
11081,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Quite fun, been playing for weeks and can barely put it down",4
11082,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Feels tedious and slow. It's not a bad game. But it's not a great game.,4
11083,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Had allot of fun with the game I like old simulating games n grinding so it's fun to me,4
11084,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Game is good , but wish there was a speed up button for training",4
11085,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Good easy fun,4
11086,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Good Sim, but a little slow",4
11087,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,It's OK. It's really not worth the high price. I'll just buy any kairosoft game that's released with out question.,4
11088,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Very fun and addictive. Enjoying this very much.,4
11089,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Good but slow progression could be faster,4

11091,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Very stickable game, just what you can expect from Kairosoft",4
11092,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Its a fun basic game great for passing time,4
11093,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Cute game.....first play thru is soooo long tho....,4
11094,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Reminds me of ippo the fighting boxing cartoon same moves very similar to the cartoon with flicker jabs corkscrew punches ect good game,4
11095,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Fun game, not as much to do but good time waster",4
11096,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Pretty decent game, but not a lot of variety to it.",4

11098,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Very Fun experience. It's kind of small tho,4
11099,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Great game, needs better instruction.",4
11100,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Good easy fun,4
11101,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"It's an alright game, no ads, and no store, so you can't pay to play better, and it's a great time killer, totally worth the little i paid for it",4
11102,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Loved the game but to be honest expected more from kairosoft after games like Ninja village or grand Prix story just feels rushed like something is missing.,4
11103,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Very fun! Loving it!,4
11104,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Great game if you have lots of time. Not if you don't. Hard to figure out how to play it at first.,4
11105,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Fun lil' game. I really appreciate that it isn't an in app purchase game.,4
11106,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Fun game. Takes me back to my Genesis days.,4
11107,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Love the game, but you can't start in airplane mode, gets stuck at 90%",4
11108,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"This is a fun game, pretty interactive and i dont really notice any time gating elements that are out of place or frustrating.",4
11109,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Really fun and nailed game. No complaints really.,4

11111,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Good offline game to kill some time.,4
11112,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Entertaining game with a old school look to it.,4
11113,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Cool,4
11114,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"I've played a bunch of these, and while I did enjoy my time playing, ultimately I was left disappointed. I would recommend waiting til they make a 2",4
11115,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Having fun with it overall. I guess my only complaint is how low the stat caps are, and there's never the right uncap item available when you need it. Other than that, I'm loving it",4
11116,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Very good app overall. Excellent time burning app that does not run ads nor any of that play to win nonsense a lot of games do. The draw back is it does get repetitive and once you get to a certain point you basically can coast through the game with no real challenge that is assuming you know what you are doing and invested properly early on. On that note if you are new to the game it can get frustrating as you have to figure it out as you go . But that aside this game is worth playing .,4
11117,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Ngl I'm only leaving a review for the in game rewards. It is a solid game that does what it says in the description. It loses a star because fast mode isn't available from the start,4
11118,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Addicting game,4
11119,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Boxers retire way too fast. Only get a short time to train them.,4
11120,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Game fun. Prices are a little nonsensical (often better to skip new builds), but just like all kairosoft games, it's good for hours of entertainment",4
11121,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,It's fun.,4
11122,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Hmmm... It's a bit boring compared to all other Kairosoft games... can only train 1 boxer at the start and after a match, there's nothing to do but wait and watch until he recovers (tho it's only a short while).",4
11123,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,It is a good little game to work on here and there.,4
11124,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Pretty good time waster,4
11125,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,It's a fun game kind of wish sometimes that you would have the fast option immediately but it's a game to kill time with that's pretty fun,4
11126,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Fun game, progression is really enjoyable. It is a little bit of a grind at some points, but overall very enjoyable.",4
11127,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Fun little game. Great time killer.,4
11128,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,I enjoy the game but there are some things in unbalanced but it is good to pass time. I like there is no paying to play would also be great to see against other people after the year.,4
11129,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Reminds me of ippo the fighting boxing cartoon same moves very similar to the cartoon with flicker jabs corkscrew punches ect good game,4
11130,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Very Fun experience. It's kind of small tho,4
11131,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Quality fun sim,4
11132,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Very enjoyable,4
11133,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Fun game. Boosts don't work for me.,4
11134,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Give me the coins,4
11135,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Nice game. It could be better by adding online or comparison to other players would be nice with extra goals,4
11136,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Solid Kairosoft Game, doesn't tell you when the game ends so you can lose alot when you start a new game plus.",4
11137,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Awesome game. Just needs more in the after 10 years part. Also the fights never break 3 rounds. Would be cool to tone down the damage,4
11138,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,It's pretty fun without the need to constantly pay attention,4
11139,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,It's a nice little grinding sims,4
11140,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Nice time waster,4

11142,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Fun,4
11143,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Fun game but runs out of content fast. Your boxer caps in stats and you can gain boosts by winning fights in the different weight classes only once.,4

11155,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Heads up, this game does not cloud save but saves locally on your phone so if you delete it or change phones you will lose all data and saves. Otherwise this game is phenominal in their story series and addictive because they know how to control your brain lol.",4

11160,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Game is good , but wish there was a speed up button for training",4
11161,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Great game, very enjoyable first play through but as others said, there is room for improvement. Maybe a speed-up button once you reach new game+ so that waiting for the weeks to go by goes quicker. Another training session which focuses on Health? Very difficult to build that up without using items and doing so is tediously painful Trainer specific items would be good aswell I like the idea that maybe you could implement a ""a fighter has called you out/challenged you"" for your title",4
11162,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Good game it will keep you entertained,4
11163,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Pretty standard Kairo, but no need to worry about combos. The main action plays out like their baseball game where you observe and occasionally use points to coach. Lots of fun and new game + is 100% worth going thru.",4

11172,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Awesome simulator and management game. Matches are fun and exciting, only criticism is that resources could be a bit more generous throughout the game.",4
11173,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Very fun game but a little repetitive. The opponents could do with been stronger as its almost impossible for them to beat you. The career extension means I had one character a champion at 4 separate weights, which is a little outside the realms of credibility. Overall worth playing",4

11180,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,I was actually surprised by how much I enjoyed this game. It stands up well next to other kairosoft games and has plenty of replayability. Only gave it a 4 because I wish it was MMA story instead of just boxing but a great game overall.,4
11181,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Good,but simple.",4
11182,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,The max +50 hp etc potions dont work. They cost a whole upgrade and then they don't work. Everything else great. Typical of a kairosoft game.,4
11183,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Pretty good game. But the income system didn't work for me. Huge investments needed and with A stats boxers i was having trouble with earning enough to upgrade my facilities.,4
11184,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Pretty addicting. Played for two days straight and burned out but it was fun and there was more room to grow.,4

11193,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Been non stop playing this game. Having a great time. Would like maybe some more features but all in all good,4
11194,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,A great take on owning your own gym.,4
11195,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Drags a bit halfway through the first playthrough, but if you build well on your first run then new game plus is really fun. I reccomend having one fighter in all sponsorship gear to consistantly have 1.2 mill income. Then you can focus on other fighters for titles",4
11196,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Honest critique here. The good: it's entertaining. Similar powerup system to High Seas Saga. Good simple char designs. It's fun for like 10 minutes. Nice fitting environment. The bad: The economy is unbalanced. Shouldn't have to wait 5 minutes irl just for power ups. You need the power ups to make your guys stronger unless you train, which also depends on a different currency (Smiles). Basically you shouldn't have to spend currency when you already have to wait. Theres more but no room",4
11197,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Finally kairosoft going back to what they do best. One of their best games in years and no more greedy and stupid IAP's which lost them their fans.,4
11198,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Good game,4
11199,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Very stickable game, just what you can expect from Kairosoft",4
11200,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"I started playing, and I thought it was cool. Now I've done a new game+ 8 times. Fyi, items carry over, max items (besides age and special) stay on boxers permanently increasing their max stats, and trainers keep their stats. Use items frequently on masked trainer to ensure new runs go smooth. ALWAYS restart as soon as you're on Y11 M4 as if you don't you can bug future runs, they will wrap up everything then for a final score. Amazing game, 8/10 Edit: Look up the wiki. It's helpful. ^_^",5
11201,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Great game, no in game apps, or purchases, just good clean fun, love the overall game play, easy to get wrapped up in it, because it's got pizazz, keep up the good work, I hope there is a sequel , or maybe some added features soon, but I will enjoy, and keep playing this game",5
11202,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Love it. Need 20 year pro extension. Once it hits that you have to fight gyms as organizations. Like destroy competition different levels. You have to do one 11 year game first however,5
11203,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,It's a fun boxing life simulator game. I like the graphics and the controls of it. It's very easy to play.,5
11204,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Addictive ""Game+"" styled grinder in a tycoon wrapper. Worth the couple of bucks for 0 ads. I'd give it 4.5 if I could. Biggest flaw is the default career life of your boxers. Very sad indeed.",5
11205,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Love these games please keep updating and creating!!!!!! Have almost entire app lineup on my phone. Great conception and execution. Replay value 10/10,5
11206,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,‚≠ê GREAT GAME ‚≠ê I love playing this game. The only negative reviews about this game are all mistakes. I guess it's confusing to some because there is no instructions. I wish there was an online option to box other live people. That doesn't seem like a hard thing to create.,5
11207,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Very enjoyable game, wish I'd read previous reviews before firts playthrough about the new game+ and only the original trainers carrying over. Levelled up a retired boxer üôÉ",5
11208,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Very fun if u use the wiki. Make sure u only get the best boxers for each division and get the ones that can be used for many different divisions,5
11209,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Usually I am a little skeptical of games that want you to pay up front. So knowing my enjoyment of sports sims I decided to give this a shot. Glad I did, sure it gets repetitive but it's light hearted enough to make me laugh and forget that. The actual fights remind me of ""ring king"", so a positive there. Best of all this game is a great diversion from the thousands of dollars wasted on ""rise of kingdoms"" and ""infinity kingdom"". A lot less stressful too. Great job.",5
11210,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,üëç game. Good amount of facilities to play with and rewards are rewarding which is great. Fighting mechanics are simple and fun! Able to change weight class when finishing 1 weight class. Recommended! But can get repetitive. The other mechanics have about the same features as other kairosoft games. Just the change of wordings that is different. What i truly appreciate is that kairosoft does not change what's not broken and implements it in every game. Only the gameplay varies. üëç Must Play. üòÅ,5
11211,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Good game to pass the time. Like the fact you don't have to pay to play, but earn everything through hard work",5
11212,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Love Kairosoft games! This one has a TON of replayability, I have just gotten to Game+ and still have belts to win!",5
11213,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"So great. I was never into the building and micromanaging in most Kairosoft games, but this one has such a perfect game flow that it doesn't feel like a chore. You basically manage their stats and invest money in expanding buildings and equipment. That's it. So satisfying hot do this and watch them win a match. Great game.",5
11214,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Another great KSoft game, can a bit to get your head round at first, and a bit slow to get going, but once you've had one boxer through it gets going, and once you unlock faster mode the combination of having the knowledge and increased game speed make it very enjoyable.",5
11215,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Just completed the game, as a whole. Very good, it's a bit tricky when you get to heavy weight. I'd recommend getting someone in the league bellow to win the title and move up a rank. Wish they was a little more to the game but overall. Very good",5
11216,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Town builder and boxing stats game all in one. Kairosoft did a great job making a fun game with a theme I can get behind. Glad that this isn't a pay to win game like the others I've played before or lately from Kairosoft. But it's a good return to form. Like the boxing theme and sim town building aspect. If you're familiar with Kairosoft games and enjoy boxing, this is what you're looking for.",5
11217,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"For casual gamer idk but if u boxing fans this game is best... People said this game is slow actualy developer want u to learn the game first because after first playthrough you unlock ""speed"" Option and a new game plus so i dont feel its painfully repetitive since theres tons of upgrades which carried over to ur new game plus and u wont be able to fully upgrade them all in just 1 or 2 playthrough.. I hope theres an update to add more ""boxer skills"" So we can customize our boxer way more!",5

11220,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"I'm a big fan of Kairosoft's sport management sims and have been waiting for them to put out a boxing themed one for ever. It has the usual hands off approach where you provide direction for training your boxers rather than directly controlling them, filling a niche left unsatisfied for me since monkey puncher on the GBC üòÖ. If you enjoy other Kairosoft style sports sims and boxing then no doubt you'll enjoy this one. Also glad to see they have opted for one off payment rather than ad based.",5
11221,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,I enjoyed this as I felt different to there other games. Plus I had to go watch ippo again after playing.,5

11242,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"While we all wait for the next Game Dev Story this installment in the larger Kairosoft works is solid. Expect the usual with some twists and turns. Also expect to work hard. Raising a world class boxer isn't the most difficult, being truly successful within the time limit is much more difficult. Solid 4.4 out of 5.",5
11243,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Honestly the entire developers suite of games is amazing. I love the depth of the games the different elements and just the overall presentation of this game. Highly recommend any from them,5
11244,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,I've been a fan of kairosoft games ever since game dev story and I have to say that this is a good one.The boxing is fun to watch and it feels great to watch your boxers get stronger and learn new skills to beat back their opponents and claim titles all while building up your own little neighborhood where your gym is located,5
11245,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Very unlike any other Kairosoft game. It's going to be nearly impossible to ""complete"" it on a first run through, I believe. Some things you will still want to reference a guide for.. like what the heck does ""Skill"" do? I dunno yet.",5
11246,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"So far, so good. It's much not complicated than I thought it'd be, but you'll get the hang of it after over playthrough. Big tip: HOARD ITEMS YOUR LAST FEW YEARS! It makes new game+ so much easier",5

11256,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Wonderful, little boxing sim. I get this with my play pass, but it's totally worth the money to buy. If you even remotely enjoy watching boxing, this game is for you.",5

11260,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"This game is amazing. Love getting smile points,sponsors,gear, etc. Also love getting new stores and equipment. You should make a wrestling game that involves this.",5
11261,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,You know I get it its an uncomfortable subject but it would be nice if you guys made black characters I love all youre games but it would be nice or give a couple different shades or lights of skin for other players ik it proably won't happen but it would be nice.,5

11264,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Love it good game wish all exhibition fighters looked different.. But love the building tree effect. And love all the odd characters we can unlock.,5
11265,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,Kairosoft games are always addictive and have a certain beauty to their simplicity. This is one of my favorites.,5
11266,net.kairosoft.android.boxing,"Good, not my favourite kairosoft game not a big fan when you have multiple character developments going on at the same time. It was the same with the movie game they did.",5

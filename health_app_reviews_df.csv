0,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"So unfortunately, I have to edit my review. These people are taking my money even after I cancel, I have emailed multiple times. Floowed full directions from the FAQ for Android! This app wasn't on ""active"" list so I couldn't cancel. Went back to my email to make sure it wqs the right acct and it was! They are messing up. I will update when they get back to me! Very messed up!",1
1,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I had this app for years. But since last one year this app hasn't been useful at all. Predictions aren't that great and in the beginning it had amazing features to log symptoms and activity throughout the month and read information about particular topics. Now whenever you click anything, it just pushes you to buy their premium subscription. The pop up adds are so aggressive, it makes the app difficult to navigate and the ads won't close either. Deleting the app.",1
2,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I have used flo for over a year to give it a good shot. The only functions that are actually helpful is tracking period dates and symptoms. The app is overtly sexual with its imaging. It it truly softcore pornography. PLUS considering how sexual and suggestive a lot of the content is, there isn't even a way to log emergency contraception! AND the notifications have never worked, even when enabled.",1
3,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've been using this app for many years, and it used to be great! It used to give health advice and was very unobtrusive. It's slowly gone downhill. Today, I updated the app and went in to track my period like normal. When I opened the app, I was bombarded with ads trying to make me pay the subscription fee! Not just one or two, but four! Four ads when I opened the app. I will be deleting this and finding a new tracker that doesn't shove features I don't want and ads down my throat.",1
4,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This company has gotten more and more greedy since I've started using it. They've completely stripped all free features to push their $40 yearly subscription, which is always ""on sale"". The ads are obnoxious and excessive. Even when I select no, I keep getting ads. They use to allow basic features in the free plan, but I can't even see an article. They also stopped the cycle reminders. I will never pay for premium, so I'm going to eventually find a different app.",1
5,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Not worth the premium. Help options are basically AI. No actual help. Was difficult to cancel and couldn't get a straight answer on when my renewal was taking place. That type of membership information should be provided in the app itself if you have already purchased. As a period tracker - there are better quality ones that are free.,1
6,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I downloaded the app, but never signed up for any subscriptions, but you somehow deducted $1 from my checking Account?? That's illegal, especially when I didn't sign up for anything, especially any trial period. I even looked into my subscriptions to make sure I didn't consent to anything by accident and there is no subscription, or trial period showing anywhere. I've already uninstalled the app, and will be contacting my bank, because this is wrong!",1
7,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It used to be a great app, then it started glitching when I went to document basic info because of all the ads and subscription pushing. It doesn't even keep me logged in anymore and asks me multiple questions each time. I'm completely over it and I wouldn't pay for a subscription ever. Moving on to better aps after using this for over 5 years. Goodbye.",1
8,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This is just ridiculous... I used for years before and it had some ads but was fine. I am 10 months postpartum and possibly starting my period so wanted re-download app... I can't even get through the freaking ""intro"" a million questions and no way to skip all of it. Just let me log in and track my stuff 😡 so annoying. Deleting app immediately.",1
9,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app sucks. I use the partner app and it frequently logs me out and gives an error when I try to log back in. Doesn't work when I need it. Furthermore, I can't actually do anything with the partner app except see where my partner is in her cycle. I can't add or do anything. It's dumb, I might as well just ask her what day she's on. It's also filled with ads and useless information. I wish my partner would choose a different app. This one sucks.",1
10,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"App used to be amazing. I had even had the sub for awhile while I was pregnant for the extra articles and advice (it used to have tips and today bits for free), but when it ended, I tried accessing the usual tips and pages.....and it's all premium now. You literally are only able to track your cycles unless you sub. I valued every bit of the tips they use to share before I subbed. I don't even open this app anymore. I track in my calendar without having to dodge ads to sub. uninstalling.",1
11,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Used to be great, but now every time I open it it asks me to upgrade & has what feels like a million pop-ups to close... And I could get past that if it worked. But it's been not saving when I record my period dates, and then doesn't warn me when I'm due - which is the whole reason I want the app. So looking for a new one now that I've reached the end of my patience with the terrible app changes over the years.",1
12,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app is decent for tracking and finding out info about different symptoms and things like that. The thing that's making me give it 1 star was the yearly subscription. I had signed up for the free trial and it slipped my mind to turn off the auto renewal. The app basically stole $40 from me. It automatically paid for a yearly subscription after the free trial. I would have been ok with it if it was an auto pay for a month only, but no. An entire year. Reaching customer service is impossible.",1
13,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Used this for a month. Changing apps now, as this one is really obnoxious and anxiety-inducing with it's constant notifications and popups over ""symptoms"" and ""concerns,"" making you click out of worry just to tell you that information is a 'premium feature.' Pretty much everything, minus the bare minimum notes and tracking, is a premium feature, despite always being pushed into your face or displayed as a tip for you. Save yourself the headache and use a different app.",1
14,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I was randomly logged out but to log in you have to go through their ENTIRE intro thing. I logged onto the wrong account (thought it was with Gmail) and opted to delete the account since it would never be used. I would have to go through the intro thing AGAIN to try logging in again. I used this app for 5 or 6 years and I'm just done. The app works fine to track my period but damn, the ""health assistant"" won't leave me alone! No I don't want to chat with an AI bot. No I don't want to upgrade.",1
15,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app was great when I had my previous phone. Once I got a new phone nothing worked (both androids so I don't think it's a system thing). I have to log in every time I open the app, none of my data will save, it asks me if I want to upgrade to premium every time I open the app (I do not want to). I have contacted support multiple times and they gave me a million things to try, none fixed it. Flo, do not reply to my 1 star review telling me to reach out to support.",1
16,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've been using this app for 5 years! During that time I've gotten 3 new phones, no problem, everything transferred over. NOT THIS TIME. I tried buying a subscription, that didn't work, instead I'VE LOST EVERYTHING EVEN ON MY OLD PHONE. FIVE YEARS OF HISTORY GONE! Which would normally be fine, but when going through peri-menopause, you need at least a year of history, now it's gone. FU, Flo.",1
17,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Used to give you alot of information. And now you have to pay for it. Why when it was always free! Update: ended up paying for the subscription for a year, forgot I did and I don't want to have the subscription for another year but was not notified that it was getting ready to resubmit the subscription. So now I am stuck with another year when I never wanted it. Should really have the app notify in advance to remind people that they have it.",1
18,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I used to really like this app because I could track the pill along with experiences and symptoms. The app stopped giving reliable notification reminders for taking the pill which was the main reason I used this app. This caused several late doses because I was not reminded by this app. Due to this. I had to get a new app as a pill reminder. Not sure why the update changed the notification and reminder settings but I'm not a fan anymore.,1
19,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I like the app it's okay. It's just pretty annoying when I log on to the app and there's a bunch of ads as soon as it opens. I don't and won't subscribe to flo premium but it's really nice to have something to track my period and pre pms symptoms. The adds are too much and I wish they would stop.,1
20,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I've been using this app for several months and unfortunately I've come to find it to be useless unless paid for. But the paid version seems to be mostly useless filler to make it seem worth paying for. I just want to see if my cycle is regular and be able to see patterns about the symptoms I've logged. It appears I can not longer see any patterns that occur during my cycle. I am switching to a different app.,1
21,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It was working great before the update, I was using it to track my cycle and as a pill reminder, but since the most recent update, the reminders and notifications stopped, and nothing I've done will allow the app to notify me, in app it says to update settings and when I go into my app settings in the phone I can't change anything and it says all notifications from the app are blocked which makes the app completely useless for me.",1
22,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Update: had to switch to another period tracker because the ads are out of control. Have been using Flo for several years and loved it, but now with these new updates the ads are annoying. --------------------- Tried a few period tracker, this one is my fave. Easy to track your period.",1
23,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It just sucks to fall in love with an app, use it for 4 years, (two different accounts bc I forgot my info) 2 pregnancies, and then all your favorite features become premium. I just loved the way it was in the past, I even paid premium for it to read extra info, but the fact that I can't access anything at all really bums me out. Sad to see it go, but I'm hoping to find a better app!",1
24,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"EDIT: In Dec 2020, I got an offer for 14.99/yr subscription for premium, so I jumped on it since I loved the info I got during my pregnancies and couldn't get them without the sub. Now we're done having babies, so the ""extras"" aren't needed. And since a recent update, the last few things I kept it for don't even exist anymore (or it's so hidden, I can't find it anymore). Kept it until I found a new app and now I'm gone. Really enjoyed it in the beginning, but too much has changed.",1
25,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"As far as tracking cycles and predicting fertile windows, the app is great. It's also easy to use. But after having the app for over 1 year, I finally removed it and switched to a different one. There are so many images that I don't care to see. The content is very sexualized. I got tired of seeing things in the app, such as sexual poses and near nakedness, that I finally removed it.",1
26,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It's pretty simple and easy to use. Unfortunately the background cannot be dark in color. My eyes cannot handle white/light colored backgrounds. I'm about to stop using this app totally. Update: July 1st 2023 Still no dark backgrounds. I've stuck through the terrible white screens but goodness I don't know how much longer. Update: Dec 28, 2023 No dark theme still. It's been nice using your app but no more. Goodbye.",1
27,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Tried the ""for partners"" version of this app. Nothing in this version is free without a subscription. Literally the only feature that was available for free was telling me when my partner is on her period, which I can just go up and ask her about anyways. Even the survey that asks how Flo for Partners can be improved required me to be a subscriber to even participate...",1
28,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Accidentally deleted previous review. The app seems great and has a lot of cool features but it has constant pop up adds and a pop up subscription request as well. I have no issue with them having a paid subscription it's advertising but it's the fact that the pop ups are constant. When using the app I receive a minimum of 5 pop ups within the span of a couple minutes.,1
29,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Everytime I try to upgrade to premium it glitches and won't load. This doesn't happen on any other app when I make purchases. It didn't even want to load the page to make this review but again, I don't have these issues with any other app on my device. Have tried to uninstall and reinstall and it does nothing. (Adding after 3rd response) I got one response from the support team, asking me to do things that I already explained didn't work and support never responded after that.",1
30,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This is quite possibly the most annoying app ever. Despite turning off notifications, I'm hounded daily with "" health insights"" and random useless tidbits (this didn't start until about two months ago). It's pretty accurate for tracking your cycle, which is literally it's only redeeming quality, but your data doesn't carry over when you switch phones even if you have an account.",1
31,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Have used this app for years and loved it. Until now. It stopped being able to predict my period or show my history due to a ""syncing error"" and kept crashing. I tried multiple things before deleting the app and reinstalling. It didn't save any of my information despite me having an account and it crashes every. single. time. I click anything in the app.",1
32,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Unfortunately, after years of use I will be deleting this app. The constant badgering about paying for premium everytime I log in or click on anything is unacceptable. The ""tips"" seem helpful at first, but only serve to pressure you into purchasing premium. While I understand that it's necessary to have a revenue stream, the ad saturation is through the roof. Ironically, if there weren't so many ads, I would've eventually purchased the premium version.",1
33,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I used to LOVE flo. I downloaded it a year ago. Back then, absolutely everything was free. All the health insights and chats were free. Recently, and without warning/notification, Flo locked all it's features! You have to pay for everything now! It would have been nice to receive an email for existing members. I would've liked a heads up that they were going to start charging for all the features they have. I definitely don't think the health insights and chat features are worth $9.99 a month...",1
34,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I used to love the app - it was perfect. Until on of the recent upgrades.. it started spamming me with useless notifications every other day - I've tried everything in the settings, but it seems that you either have to turn off all notifications completely (but then you won't receive a notification about an upcoming period) or you will be spammed with almost daily notifications like 'check out secret chats!'. Shame",1
35,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"They ruined it. 2 years ago I used Flo while trying to conceive our youngest. It was easy to use and free. I re-downloaded it and have been trying to use it for 3 days. They moved the place to track BBT and I can't find it anywhere. I even tried the subscription.The helpcenter is for the old version, with videos on how to customize your symptom parameters. Useless, bc none of that exists now. I emailed the help desk and have not gotten a reply. I'm so irritated! Can't find or change anything!",1
36,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"A great app until the most recent update. I'm uninstalling. Asking for premium membership would have been fine, but it feels like I'm being bullied into it. Features I enjoyed have been taken away or rendered more difficult to find/use. I can't even see DAILY walking distance, only a cumulative total for my entire cycle. If there is a way to look at the daily distance, they sure as hell made sure it was difficult to find.",1
37,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Loved this app until it started nagging me to upgrade to premium. The tipping point was when I opened the app while on the phone with my doctor and couldn't access the calendar without taking a questionnaire that ended in a pitch to buy the premium version. I didn't mind that features got moved to the paid version as I only used it as a period and symptom tracker. But when I wasn't even able to do that without getting an ad, it just wasn't worth it. Deleted the app.",1
38,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I loved it at first. It is very accurate at predicting. But it sends daily notifications for very random things, sex tips, etc and turning them off also turns off notifications for period predictions. I contacted the company and was told it is NOT possible to decrease the random notifications and keep prediction notifications at the same time. Even if I chose to turn off notifications & just check the app calendar, the app opens articles and tips that I really do NOT want to see. Kinda gross.",1
39,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I loved it, it was working great. One day I stopped getting my pill reminders, and when I opened the app up, all of my information was gone. Months of tracking, not only my periods but my neuro symptoms for my appointments, all gone. And it says that my email isn't associated with a backup account even though I made sure I set that up when I started using the app. I'm incredibly disappointed.",1
40,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Used to be a really helpful app but now all the useful content is behind an unreasonably expensive pay wall. I'm talking more expensive than Netflix. On top of that every other button you click makes the premium add pop up. If they switch to ads before the articals I think that would be a happy medium. They still make money and I won't be changing apps!,1
41,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app may say it's free to download but if you actually want to use it you might as well pay their subscription fee. Almost everything is locked behind a paywall and the app is constantly pushing ads in your face. I've seen some different sales they have going on for the subscription fee but honestly it's not worth it. Also, I'm CONSTANTLY getting notifications. Like at least twice a day. In the beginning I thought they were helpful but now they are just annoying. Don't get this app.",1
42,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I have used this app for a couple years now. For the last few months, it has become bloated and slow, and annoying to use because of its incessant ampunt of pop ups, not just for Premium Upgrades, but also for unwanted services, stories and other things. I held on because it would be a pain to have to start over again on a new app. However i am officially leaving because of the bloated nonsense has gotten me to the point where getting another period makes me dread having to open the app to log.",1
43,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Been using flo for almost two years now, and they suddenly completely chance up the symptom tracker interface? It's too jumbled for me to make anything out, they take away the option of what categories you want to see, and they completely remove the weight tracker? Why? I sincerely hope y'all change it back, there was nothing wrong with how the interface was before.",1
44,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I have had this app for a couple years now, and I'm sick and tired of the need to buy the ""unlimited"" plan to get any insights on anything. I've also had multiple losses, and the app doesn't adjust appropriately for it. I feel like it just ignores it and doesn't adjust cycle averages appropriately, insights on loss and grief, etc. I'm just done and looking for something better.",1
45,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The only thing you get free is tracking and bare basic graphs. People don't have the extra for all the ""tips"" and everything they want you to pay for. I used to be able to see the first slides of the daily insights but since I got a new phone I get NO daily insights now. I'm about to find another app that will actually let me see some information without needing a subscription.",1
46,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It USED to be great until I updated. I'm constantly harassed by the notifications that aren't even useful. The one notification I did like was when it told me my cycle was starting in a few days and that's gone. Everytime I go to the home screen it gives me a popup asking for a rating. This is so disappointing, as I've really come to love this app for its accuracy and personalization settings. Now everything just feels corporate and annoying.",1
47,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Too. many. alerts. You guys have done something and now I'm getting so many alerts and your options to turn them off seem to be all over the place. I just want to know when my period is stating. That's it. Edit: developer responded to turn off notifications in the phone setting. Hello? Did you read my review? I want to get notifications for my period etc. Turning off all notifications defeats the purpose. Unhelpful response. Time to find a new app!,1
48,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It is one thing to have features tucked behind a paywall that don't bother the user into ""sUBSCRIBE 2 PREMIUM"" pages. It is entirely another to have those features ping you multiple times every day and masquerade as regular features. There are advertisements that pop up as soon as you open the app, multiple times, that do not let you use the app until you continue to the payment plan page. Then you may exit out. Would not recommend, it's absolutely infuriating to use on a regular basis.",1
49,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"App was great before the update. Please give an option to get rid of those annoying pop-up stories! I DO NOT need more notifications on my phone every day. UPDATE: Emailed support to ask about removing daily, unnecessary, notifications. I only use app to track my period. Their reply was for me to turn off all notifications, which would also turn off the notifications that my period is coming! Doesn't that defeat the whole purpose of why I have this app? Dropping from 3 stars to 1. Uninstalling.",1
50,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app was alright. I had been on an IUD that kept me from having periods, so it was mostly used for symptom tracking. It was frustrating when I started trying to get pregnant because it would say my cycles were 6 months long because of the IUD, so trying to find ovulation was difficult. I managed to get pregnant with out it, and now suddenly at 30 weeks, all of the reading content is premium content. Not paying for previously free content. Give me a reason to pay for something extra!",1
51,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Great App! I've used it for over a year now. Very easy to put your information in. But the past month, maybe, it's been bugging and lagging.

I always make sure my app is up to date also.",1
52,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app was great before. However, with the recent update, I've been getting daily notifications about my hormones, body temperature, and just about everything period and body related in all the functions of this app. I have all my notifications TURNED OFF because I DO NOT WANT THEM. I AM NOT INTERESTED IN THEM. Yet the notifications keep coming in. The settings need to do what it says it does. Also, all the notifications settings needs to be all in one place rather than on 10 different places.",1

I literally just want to track my period and if these irrelevant notifications don't end, I'm switching trackers.",1
54,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"My pedometer stopped working after the last update. I have tried everything. Checking Flo settings, checking my phone settings, looking online. Reinstalling the app was the last resort option and Flo claimed that no data would be lost. Well that only works for paying customers, not those who have been using the app for years. I lost years of data and the pedometer wasn't fixed. Great, thanks a lot.",1
55,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I do not recommend! Try this and another app at the same time and you'll see the difference. The app has not changed at all and I've been using it for years. You will get bombarded with ads asking you to upgrade when you open the app. If you have the notification on you will get several of them a day and it's annoying. I never get the notification that my period is coming in but the can get the annoying notifications out smoothly.,1
56,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I used to really like using this app to track my periods but now it's sooo annoying. All day, every day, I get these annoying notifications (even though I went into the settings and turned OFF notifications)!

I'm 36 years old, been having periods for the past 24 years..I don't need information about periods. I JUST want to track my period so I know when it's coming. Uninstalling this app",1

Now hit after a certain time that I need to upgrade and pay for the subscription to get the insite information. It is 9.99/month or 39.99/year. I am not paying that much just to read the insite pages that I could get from another app. Very disappointed now and will be switching to a different app.",1

Idk who thought making it look more juvenile was a smart idea, but it isn't a good experience. Not to mention I now longer have the ability to have my symptoms list with the items I use most. Not everyone logs their mood, or if they took any type of test, and having the ability to move what I actually want to the top of the list is gone. Do better, Flo!",1
60,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I used this app for 7 years, but they changed the icons and now everything is worse. They got rid of the easy to use circle icons, in a row grouped by category, and replaced it with text. Now I have to scroll and use a search bar to add symptoms. What used to take 30 seconds everyday is a chore now and i cant track sleep and weight easily anymore. They added a bunch of clutter, half of them ads, to the home screen. Please revert the design changes.",1
61,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Used to really like this app until everything became about buying their premium subscription, slowly removing the available features until free users have nothing. I became so sick of seeing the pestering reminders to purchase that I'm now switching to a different period tracker even if it means that I have to manually input all of my historical data. That was the only reason holding me back from switching to another app. I'm sick and tired of Flo and now moving on to greener pastures.",1
62,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"If you want a free app experience, the whole app interface is essentially bloat. Anywhere you click will most likely be met with it asking you to subscribe. Even the most basic things like ""Why is (body part) tender?"" Which is a quick Google search away. When I don't know where to click to get the most basic cycle information without having to see pushy advertisements, that's when you push users away.",1
63,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Too much clutter and pop ups. Used to be a good, simple app, now it bombards me with chat bots, daily articles, a never ending ""offer"" for a subscription (which I wouldn't mind paying if it was the old app of years ago), and time consuming and unnecessary animation. I wish there was an option to turn off all the bloat and focus on just my symptoms and predictions. Switching to a more minimalist app.",1
64,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It was a good app. Lately, there are so many notifications for things that they want you to spend money on, it became much like harassment. These notifications can't be turned off. I had to find another app and uninstall.

Turning off all notifications means you don't receive notifications about upcoming periods and such, which makes the app pretty pointless.",1

I checked all the settings to not revive any notifications (aside from when my cycle will begin), and I still get unnecessary notifications for random stuff. This app used to be great. Now it's just bloated and annoying. I'm going to be looking for a different app.",1
66,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Used to be a fantastic straightforward app for tracking dates. It is now nothing but a data mine. It's so riddled with surveys, ads, and pages of them begging you to record your every minute symptom, that it's unusable. Want to quicky log in and see when ovulation is coming up? Too bad, you now have to click through 10 pages of required training and questions before it'll show you your calendar. Unusable garbage.",1
67,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app was helpful but now I'm getting lost under all the adds. I've email twice to cancel the subscription but they email its been done and I just received another charge. Why can't it be simple like other apps just one click and your done.

But now it does not function the same and I all they want is to pay for the app. I have found a different app to replace almost everything on here so it's unfortunate that they kept changing to make it more difficult. And the ads for the upgrade are ridiculous.",1
70,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I got this app a couple years ago when my husband and I were trying to get pregnant. It was great at the time, and helped track and gave great health insights, however with everything switching to having to be a premium user, I'm finding myself looking into another app. I understand the need for premium, but when you can't even track baby's growth and changes without paying extra, it makes it difficult to enjoy the app.",1
71,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The update ruined the free experience. Almost every button leads to a paywall without any indication it will be doing so. It's a guessing game of what works and what's an ad. It does not make me want to upgrade. *** To respond to the dev comment, I'm not disappointed by your business model, it's the integration into the experience that's a problem. There aren't clear indicators of free vs premium. It's a UX issue.",1
72,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"To reiterate and emphasize what so many have said already, this app is good for keeping track of your period and that's basically it. Nearly every other feature is locked behind a subscription paywall that the app constantly tries to push on you during use. I've been using Flo for about 5 years and it was great in the beginning, but I feel like it strays further and further from what set it apart from other period apps as time goes on. Now, any other app does the same thing- and less obnoxiously",1
73,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I have been using this app for years now. Never before has it been so incredibly frustrating. Ads for premium every other second when I dare go onto the app for anything. Good luck clicking on ANYTHING, that's a premium feature! BUY BUY BUY! Ugh. The UI has become uglier and uglier, less customizable than ever. Spam notifications are also constant. I have literally EVERYTHING except my period start date turned off. Yet I'm getting constant notifs for other BS! Click it and it's another ad! BUY!!",1
74,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I used to love this app but this latest version will tell you about relevant information and when you click on it, it tells you it's for premium members only. I get that they have bills to pay, but they at least need to fix the settings so I'm not constantly baited with premium content. It's really frustrating to only be able to track your period and not get relevant info when you need it.",1
75,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Flo was my go to app for years, but the pop up ads at launch have made me turn to something else. When I need my period data quickly, say at a doctor's office, I have to wait for the X to load and click it multiple times to reject something that they could easily have as a ""upgrade to premium"" button. Poor choice on someone's part at the company, I'm surprised they haven't watched their data and reviews and fixed this. Bye, Flo!",1
76,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It didn't track my ovulation period as well as another period app I had been using, and the free version is so cluttered with ads and pop ups that it is extremely annoying to use. I honestly detested using this, I just wanted to have another set of predictions in addition to the other free one I was using. Would not recommend unless you feel like paying for it.",1
77,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've had this app for years and it used to be the absolute best! But the ads and pop-ups for the premium are constant and now I can't access even the most basic information for free. For example, it used to just show some expected symptoms for where I'm at in my cycle, now they're all blurred out. Also, a lot of the article that are in full view (but I wish were blurred out) are ""How to get the most out of your orgasms"" in all caps with two naked girls hugging each other. Will be deleting.",1
78,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I used to love this app, but now it's extremely annoying and cumbersome to use. Too many bells and whistles were added, causing lots of incessant and unnecessary pop ups, ads, recommendations, chat bubbles, etc. The earlier version was perfect -- why mess with a good thing?! Uninstalling and finding something else that's more clean and minimalistic, like this one used to be.",1
79,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"THIS APP IS A WASTE OF MONEY. Wish I could rate 0 stars. I can't rely on its accuracy anymore, rendering it useless. Recent updates have only served to make it less useful and harder to navigate. They removed basic ""features"" like weight tracking (important for pregnant women!), but left any existing data to be used in its ""insights"" and graphs, as well as daily notifications to log weight, as well as an option to set a target weight. At best, it's sloppy. What else have they messed up??",1
80,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Have been using this app for over 12 years to simply track my cycle, not all women are of child bearing want or age. I get the ads, and don't mind them, but now I'm being forced to pay for anything and everything. This was the best app out there but not any longer, bring back the ads and free features. A reasonable one time fee of $20ish would be fine too. I know it costs to develop the ad but to the tune of $100 / year per user without the ""holiday discount"", hard pass.",1
81,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The ads are absolutely horrendous. I can look past ads in almost all apps, but this is different. The more time goes on, the more I do NOT want to purchase a subscription. Actually, I'm manually re-entering my data into a new app because clearly, this one is getting worse with ads, regardless of how many people write negative reviews. As a software engineer, this app to me is a dressed up cheap algorithm with extremely invasive and renders the app borderline unusable.",1
82,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I have used this app for several years and through several phones, but I'm done. I loved Flo when it was simple, since all I wanted to do was track my incredibly irregular periods to try and look for trends and averages. But every new feature takes up more space on the screen and makes it harder to find and access the simple parts. I can't even launch the app without at least one ad about the Premium version, which has dozens MORE features that I don't want. I am switching to a different app.",1
83,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Ok, I've used this app for actual years but it has recently become impossible to use. It is constantly asking for payments, it's significantly slower with its unnecessary ""health insights"" and it's shoving massive ads in my face opposed to the small ones below that 95% of other apps have. It's just become too much. Unless something changes, I will be searching for a new app and would dissuade anyone from downloading this one in the future.",1
84,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,This app used to be perfect. Now it's useless and full of ads. I only want to get notifications on my period and not insights I am not interested in. Also everytime I open the app I have to close all the annoying premium pop-ups just to finally see when my period starts! I understand that the developers want to make money from it but they can make it in a more peaceful way. I am going to uninstall it.,1
85,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I got this app because I have irregular periods and wanted to be able to accurately track them. What I got instead was several popups in minutes to ""join premium! join premium! give us your money!!!!"" One of the worst experiences I have ever had with any app. I cannot in good faith recommend this app to anybody who doesn't have the money to throw away just to get rid of the annoying popups.",1
86,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Have had this app for years. If someone could recommend me a new period tracker that doesn't shove advertisements for a subscription down my throat, let me know! I just need to check where I am in my cycle and I get bombarded with at least 2-3 ads. With medical diagnosis being skirted, due to healthcare where I live, having this app was consistent for tracking and information. Now I can't seem to get a solid answer , even from an AI bot, cause it wants me to spend money for a full explanation.",1
87,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I used to love this app but now there is just too many ads, its hard to even navigate. I understand that all apps need to find a revenue model but I can't even use the apps basic functionality anymore without having a pop-up window asking me to purchase the premium version between every click. It is excessive and distracting. I personally just like the tracking function, I'm not interested in the period coaching so getting ads every second makes me want to look elsewhere. Disappointed 😔",1
88,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Been using for over 5 years, even despite the data selling headlines. However with every update it gets more obnoxious. I'm ok with a few ads in order to pay for an otherwise free app. But lately every function has been moved behind a paywall. I couldn't even log my symptoms or days of spotting. It's no better than a paper calendar at this point. Sorry but this last update did it for me and I'm looking elsewhere or just using pen and paper, which is about as useful.",1
89,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This used to be the absolute best app I've used, but the latest update introduced tons of useless notifications. You cannot turn them off within the app, and if you turn them off via your phone's notification settings then you also won't get your personally set reminder notifications, so you're just stuck with the annoying ones. time to find a different app.",1
90,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"April update was a bust. It needs to be redone. Why would we want the options? Things we have been logging for years now are just erased. Data is completely gone. Makes no sense. Paid for premium since you keep hassling me to each time I open the app. Thought maybe all the data you took from me would be part of the now premium plan, but no, it wasn't. Hopefully, another update is on the way to fix all the issues that were overlooked. I'm just gonna have to go back to my trusty pen and calendar.",1
91,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Lost All Data. They changed the app and it is no longer a free service with the option to pay for premium. You have to pay after the ""30 day free trial."" Because they made this change, all of my previous data is lost. This was data I was planning to bring to a gynecologist, because my cycles have been irregular for the past three years of using the app. I was given no warning, no option to back up my data, it is simply gone. Three years of meticulously tracking my cycle and symptoms. Gone.",1
92,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It used to be great. Now it pushes you to switch to premium when your ""situation"" changes (ex.= pregnancy). Once you change to ""Free trial"" it never reminds you that you are close to the ending of the free period and all of a sudden you receive a notification of your annual bill. I cancelled the subscription the exact same and received a refund. It keep insisting to change to Premium. Why do I need to pay, when I'm giving you more info than the one you give me. Avoid it. Look for other options.",1
93,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I used this app for almost a year. It was accurate and easy to navigate. The tips and insights were awesome. I switched phones and tried to log into my account. It said my email doesn't exist in their database. Emailed support, no response. Every night at midnight there's a blank notification on my phone from the app. Uninstalling and will be finding a different tracker app.",1
94,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The app itself is okay (tracks my period, all I use it for). However, multiple daily notifications about irrelevant topics that I cannot turn off or opt out of - very annoying, very frustrating. This is a relatively new ""feature"", and I wish it would go away. App also used to remind me when my period was about to start, but does not do that anymore - thank goodness for telework or that would have been a humiliating day at work! I will be researching other alternatives to replace Flo.",1
95,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I really liked this app, truly. I've been using it for almost three years but after recent updates the symptom screen is a mess, you can't track your bbt without the paid version (?????), and when you go to the hell screen it's like it's giving answers for the version of the so that wasn't messed up. I hope they can fix this app but I am looking for something new.",1
96,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app is okay but just so annoying to use? It takes way too many steps to log your period, and it's less of the actual logging and more of like how many advertisements for premium that you have to go through to tap like 2 buttons. Instead you have to keep clicking to, like, close this advertisement, close this little chat box, etc. etc.",1
97,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app used to be great. I used it for years to track my irregular periods. I was pregnant so I deleted it for a while. Now that I want to use it again, I see that they have started pushing a subscription and the free version is now super slow and glitchy. I cant even track my period on it because the calendar screen freezes. Terrible, I'll be looking for another option",1
98,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This is the perfect example of how to ruin an amazing app. They took off all the nice free features like insights about possible symptoms, add a bunch of ads to go premium and restricted the available info for free users. And the UI, omg, it was nice and clean and customizable and with every update is getting worse and worse. I was lazy to uninstall it before, but congrats, your bad decisions have overcome my procrastination.",1
99,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Used to be my go-to app but after a recent update, turned into my least favorite app. Getting reminded of your period sucks, but is necessary. Getting random reminders from the app about all the random advise they can help with (that use to be free) for a price is both infuriating and misleading. I don't want to see that stupid little icon unless I'm 3 days from the main event. Can't seem to stop them without stopping the important reminder.",1

Its gotten worse over time and has become basically impossible to check quickly on my period tracker without at least triggering two prompts to go premium. I'd advice anybody to better go to any other app to keep track of their period, this one is not worth it",1
196,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I don't know why people are saying the free features are good when you can't click on anything without having it pop up to ask for money. What exactly is free?

It also gave decent info about my babies growth stages during my last 2 pregnancies. But within the last year, it has been overwhelmingly advertising its premium subscription. And some of the locked content hidden behind the sub service has images and titles that are so sexual! I understand that this is an app for women, but is it really necessary to be so lewd? Hunting for a new app now!",2
202,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Over the years I've used this app, it has become 3 things: inaccurate, misleading, and extremely aggressive. Every second you use this app, it pushes its expensive premium subscription onto you in some way or another. Upon opening, it gives you pop-ups for an AI assistant that Flo admits is unreliable. Additionally, the way they log and predict your symptoms and periods has become more complex and yet I find that it's predictions do not adjust to new data and are inaccurate 60-70% of the time.",2
203,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app used to be great. Unfortunately, the recent update has completely ruined the app for me. I wanted this app as a simple period tracker. However, the app has become so sexual! It's not even about tracking periods anymore. It's about tracking your sex life and pregnancy. As a teenager, I just want to track my cycle. Also, the ads for purchasing a subscription are constant and annoying. I'm not inclined at all to purchase the premium version. Overall, this app has become a disappointment.",2
204,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"App is good for tracking the start & end of your period. Which is good, but they charge for EVERYTHING else. Up until recently, I was able to see my ovulation days, but now it looks like that feature is only available in the paid version. The app constantly tries to offer tips and advice under the guise of a friendly chat, but when you want to learn more, everything is behind the pay wall. The app is barely useful anymore. Everything has a monthly fee, I'm not paying one to track my period.",2
205,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I used this while trying to get pregnant in 2022, and then used it through my whole pregnancy. It had a function where I could easily look at the development of my baby across different weeks to see how they changed. I would look weeks ahead at a time and get excited learning about what was coming. I guess they got rid of that feature and now to get that info I have to scroll through the calendar and view each week separately. Feels like a downgrade/backstep as far as functionality goes.",2
206,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,It's my (5th) yearly review reminding you guys that you're still throwing things in my face that I don't want and would like to turn off. I don't need the assistant to pop up ever 3 seconds trying to get me to interact with it. I'm also super confused as to why I'm getting ads to purchase a subscription when I have already paid for a subscription and it's not up until next summer... Also why I will NEVER pay full price for this app. $40 a year is too much to be annoyed every time I open the app.,2
207,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've used this for years and it has been a great help with tracking my periods, but every time I open it, it just glitches. The stories don't pop up and it can be non-responsive at times. I also enjoy the updated tags, but it would be nice to add our own. I'll continue to use it to track my periods, but it is difficult to explore.",2
208,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"There are simply too many intrusive pop-ups, ads, upsells, etc. Launch the app, there's a two page upsell. Mark a symptom, another upsell. Initiate a period and want to check some things, nope, there's the Flo assistant pop-up with the same conversation tips you've already seen. If you're a free user you will spend more time dismissing popups and dialogues than navigating through the actual app. Used to be really good but there's absolutely no ease of flow (haha) when using the app.",2
209,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Used to be super helpful but now I can't look at a single article without having premium. It won't even list a few reasons why my period might be late without asking me to get premium. I love the conversations we as girls can have on the app and I love that they're completely anonymous but there have barely been any new conversations since I first joined the app in 2021. At this point the only thing I use it for is to make sure I'm having a fairly normal schedule. I might use a different app,2
210,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Used to love the app, but now I hate that I keep getting pop ups for premium service! What makes me really mad is that I did have it at one time for a discounted price (15$ a year) and was then canceled on me out of nowhere way before it was due for a renewal. And that discounted price I got was supposed to last a lifetime when I got it 2 years ago. Now if I want to use it, I have to pay 40$ a year. Seriously? Thanks flo for capitalizing on tracking our periods🙃",2
211,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Loved this app until I had to switch phones. It makes me go through their questionnaire instead of giving me the immediate option to log in. Then when I did finally get to login, none of my data was saved, so I have to log out, go through the whole questionnaire again before I get to try another login method to see if that one works. Very irritating.",2
212,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Too many ads these days - it wasn't always this way, and I used to think it was a great app, but now everytime I click on just about anything, I first get an ad to switch to premium, which I don't want to do. I get that that's how they make money, but it's still annoying that it happens SO much. Also, I REALLY wish there was a way to turn off notifications about symptoms I may or may not have that day, like headaches. Otherwise, it's helpful with tracking periods and pregnancy.",2
213,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I like this app except for the fact that it takes away certain features after using them for a little while which is really annoying. Wish you could at least watch adds to unlock things. Took away my ability to log my birth control which is extremely annoying. Good for tracking period and that's about it. All the other features are available through prescription which I think is overpriced so pretty much the rest of the app is trash.,2
214,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The app is usually very good and I even sprung for the premium version but in the last month, the notifications function stopped working. Since the primary reason I have an app like this is to remind me to take my pills, the app isn't very useful at the moment. I hope it can be fixed soon. Edited to add: I reached out to support on November 1 and as of November 10, the issue still isn't fixed.",2
215,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The information provided is helpful. It's a decent tracking app. I gave 2 stars because their attempts to get you to upgrade are obnoxious. Then, once you pay for a subscription and then cancel so you don't get charged again, they're literally right back at it with the obnoxious upgrade pop ups!!! I'm about ready to completely cancel everything, delete the app, and demand a refund for what I've already paid.",2
216,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The app is easy to use, but as someone who refuses to pay for premium, it's ineffective. It wouldn't be so annoying if there wasn't pop up ads each and every time. Not only that, but a user shouldn't have to pay for premium just to read articles related to their current delimma (in my case, late period). So 4 stars. I'm switching to a different app. This one is a bust.",2
217,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Even after the newest update the options for darker settings are still unavailable. The pushiness of promoting the paid version is also irritating and near constant. Especially since I've done the free trial and wasn't interested in continuing the subscription. I'm considering switching to a different app even though I like this one when it leaves me alone and lets me use it as just a tracker Nearly 8 months later and still no option for darker settings so I knocked off a star,2
218,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I had been loving this app until all of a sudden my notifications were blocked and now it's not sending me any reminders or alarms. What am I missing here that all of a sudden they would be blocked and there doesn't seem to be a way to fix it in my settings so must be on the apps end somewhere. Would really appreciate help with this!,2
219,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app was amazing when I found it years ago, with so much good advice and real science to help me understand my cycle and what I could do to try to conceive. I was never interested in the premium features. Unfortunately, in the past year or more, many of the features I made much use of have been locked out as a premium feature. So I literally only still have the app because I don't want to lose the years of cycle history.",2
220,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I just wanted a cycle tracker. This app always has pop-ups, asking me if I want to chat about things such as discharge, etc. NO THANK YOU!! Disgusting topics and too many pop-ups and windows to close before being able to just see the calendar. It is also always asking me to subscribe to the premium version for a ridiculous price. I just got a new phone and SO HAPPY to try a new, more basic app for this purpose.",2
221,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Edited for respone to developer: Overall not a bad app and does what I was looking for which is to track. My issue is how misleading your features are for free users. Basicaly everything outside of basic tracking is an ad but with no warning. I was prompted to start a chat but after the 3rd step I find out its only for premium users. Take away: don't waste our time. Show us whats premium and whats not. Maybe throw a free article in here or there and people would be more likely to subscribe.,2
222,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It works for basic tracking, but the constant ads for upgrading to the paid version is annoying. It's every time I open the app. I get teased for special features that are only available on the paid version. I'm never going to pay for a period tracker and I wish there was a way to opt out of the upgrade ads.",2
223,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,It was great but suddenly I wasn't getting notifications anymore. I tried everything but nothing works and it seems that the notifications are just blocked for no reason. I use this app religiously and very much rely on the notifications. I'm extremely frustrated that it isn't working anymore.,2
224,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"So I had this app installed on my last phone and I just got a new one and right away not a fan. I have no idea if it's the app or the phone but it will not allow me to set reminders or allow any notifications to go through, regardless if this issue is not fixed I will unsubscribe from this. Even though it has been very helpful for me, but once again if I can't set reminders for myself on the app what is the point of even using it.",2
225,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've been using this app since 2021. The predictions are very accurate and the layout is nice. However, I can't even open the app without at least one full screen ad for Flo premium.

226,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Unless you pay for it, the only thing you can do on this app is log your period and symptoms. The constant bombardment of ""pay for a subscription to get helpful info on your cycle"" popups has me looking at other apps. There seems to be good info available if you feel like paying for, but you can also just Google it and get the same vague stuff. They sell your info, just like any other tracking app, but you have to pay to look at it.",2
227,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,TOO MUCH. And most of it is locked behind a paywall. I tried this app when Clue was under construction and it's just too busy there's way too much going on. And most of it you can't even click on. After trying to deal with it since Clue locked an important feature for me after their update (literally just notes) I've given up and looked for a simpler app.,2
228,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I miss the widget. I'm editing my 4 ⭐ rating to 2 ⭐ I used to keep up-to-date because seeing the widget form of the app front and center reminded me to keep on top of recording my cycle and symptoms. so now I don't use it at all because I forget about it which defeats the purpose of the app. On top of that the user interface is so ugly compared to before, I really don't like it.",2
229,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I used to love this app. It was a great period and ovulation tracker and I've been using it for years. There was a recent update that added a premium option (no problems there) but since then there are notifications constantly about random ads and their premium offerings (that won't turn off. I can't open the app without having to close out of the premium option. I'm sure the app is great if you want a ton of paid bells and whistles, but I really just want a simple and effective period tracker.",2
230,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Works fine for tracking my period, which is all I want. Unfortunately it keeps trying to push all these other features that I don't care about and started sending frequent notifications about those other features with no easy way of opting out of those extra notifications without also disabling the regular period notifications. I'll probably try to find a different app soon.",2
231,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Flo is a great app for period tracking, and that's about all I can say as a positive. Every time I open the app, I have to click out of 3 separate ads trying to get me to buy their premium subscription. Every day, itll offer you a ""private chat"" that you can't access any of the information unless you upgrade, which is truly infuriating. The main feature of the app (period and symptom tracking) works fine, and is available without a fee. EVERYTHING ELSE is locked behind the premium subscription.",2
232,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Similar to others, I used this for years & it was really helpful. I've never particularly been interested in the insights but the period tracking and reminders were helpful. Now notifications are only about paid features I don't have or want and the notifications I actually use the app for, ""your period will be starting soon"" no longer pop up at all. My options seem to only be turning off all notifications through the phone or being bombarded with ones I tried to turn off through the app.",2
233,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've been using this app for several years through 2 pregnancies and loved it. I'm assuming the recent ""update"" forced some bugs into the system, It doesn't keep period logged so it won't show ovulation unless I re-enter every time. I contacted support which wanted me to download something else to record/ show them the issue (even though I see others reported it below) even though i was very clear. I'm bummed because I've loved this app for so long but it seems to be time to look for another.",2
234,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It's great for tracking your symptoms and period. Prediction is usually accurate. My frustration is that they're really greedy. They offer you Flo assistance on the premise that you'll get any insight at all and each time it's like clickbait because it won't tell you anything new without demanding that you pay. I tried a trial week of their subscription and it's not worth it. It's over priced. Maybe helpful for people who want to get pregnant. But for regular menstrual users, skip it.",2
235,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Used to be good, even without the subscription. Now after recent update it takes forever to load everytime you click on something. By the time it unfreezes you forget what you were going to do. I don't even want to pay for the upgraded version if the regular version won't work right. EDIT: to their response- this has nothing to do with moving things out of the free plan. ITS LITTERALLY SLOWER THAN DIAL UP. If the app loads regularly in the paid version then this is a junk app.",2
236,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app was the best out there, but I agree with others. The ""premium"" option is too much money, and it's in your face all the time. I'm good with the free version, but it pops up with an ad for the ""premium"" version every time I open it. And it will show up in my notifications about whatever and the notification stuff is behind a paywall. I shouldn't have my notifications used as advertising.",2
237,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"While this app was pretty great, the constant bombardment of ads for premium is off-putting. There's so many unnecessary features, why would I want to talk to (or pay) an AI to give me tips on my period? I thought I could ignore it, but the first thing that pops up when you open the app is an ad for premium. The birth control reminder and drink water reminders never worked, no matter what settings I change or toggle on/off, I never get push notification reminders. I've been using since 2017",2
238,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I used Flo for years, and I honestly loved it. It was simple, easy, and accurate--pretty much all I wanted from a period tracker app! But I've noticed they've REALLY been pushing the premium subscription. Every time I get on the app they advertise it, and when I try to use some features I'll get a pop up that says ""To go further, get our premium subscription!"" Things that used to be free aren't!! I can't do it any more, and I've been forced to uninstall. Sorry, not sorry.",2
239,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Used this app for several years to track periods& symptoms with no issues. Unfortunately there has been more of a push towards Premium which has very much gotten in the way of basic period tracking. Must close out of several premium pop ups when to open the app. They recently changed notifications to include ""personal advice"" which was sending me half a dozen notifications a day. When I turned those off I no longer received period start notifications (whole point of the app!) Will be uninstallin",2
240,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I used this app for over a year and really liked it. I felt it was pretty accurate and easy to log things. HOWEVER, it has gotten to the point that every single time I open the app there is an ad for the premium version that I have to press multiple buttons to get through. Sometimes I have to click through 3 pages just so I can log! It has completely ruined the app for me and as soon as I find an alternative I like I will be uninstalling.",2
241,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Never mind, the picture blocks are still there when I try to log symptoms. Please return to the old interface, this is terrible. I'll be keeping my review at 2 stars until it's changed. I mostly use this to keep track of my period so while the premium stuff can be annoying, I still like using the app as a period health record. The secret chats are also nice to shoot off thoughts.",2
242,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Unless you want to pay for premium, you might want to look into different period apps. Because of the recent updates, most information other than the basic tracker is premium only. Personally, this was okay at first. However, now I keep getting notifications from this app, and it seems that I have no actual option to turn them off. It's extremely annoying to get notifications about orgasms and working out. This app had a lot of potential but their main priority now seems to be making money.",2
243,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Had a pretty good experience for a long time & the calculator was very accurate for my overall pretty regular cycle. It's gotten much worse in the past year with the advertising and near forcing me to sign up.

244,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Works great for tracking your period and symptoms, but as other users are mentioning, it drives me INSANE with push notifications. I can't turn them off completely, or else I don't get notifications about my period starting soon. It's so bad I'm switching to using my fitbit's tracking instead and uninstalling the app. I would come back if it wasn't constantly pushing ""tips,"" ""info,"" and their premium features all the time.",2
245,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app is getting greedier the longer I have it! I first downloaded the app in 2018 and I loved it, because they didn't shove their subscription thing down your throat. That has totally changed. Now if I want to go back and read previous insights that were free for me, I now have to buy the subscription! Also now they shove the subscription down your throat because you can't do anything in the app without first staring at their add for several seconds! It is accurate though.",2
246,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I loved this app and have used it for many years. I resisted updating as I anticipated basic features would suffer from the Premium push. I was right. I have zero interest in any of the ""premium"" features and only want to long my info.

Close the pop up, second upgrade pop up appears. Middle of the screen, do you want to upgrade? Go back to the home page, pop up again! I had to uninstall, it was just too much.",2
248,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The app is helpful and was pretty accurate in predictions, and the assistant is a nice touch with learning more info. I had the premium service for a bit, but in light of the social climate in the US, and that anonymous mode was promised and doesn't seem to be available yet, I'm cancelling and uninstalling. Quite frankly, it just doesn't seem to be safe, and I'm in one of those states unfriendly to women.",2
249,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I thought your app would be useful many years ago. As you build something creative, you can and should charge money for it. However now I'm bombarded with ads, a ton of extra ""chat"" bots, and screens I can't exit out of. I think that you have turned at least one person away from something that used to be a useful tool people appreciated. An ad-free version vs an ad-included version...fair. Me not being able to choose the ad-incl version without being BOMBARDED...I think greedy. How much $?",2
250,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Edit: I got a response from their team but it was in Aramaic or something. I'm not sure why they thought I would be able to read that but that's even less helpful. I wouldn't recommend this app to anyone at this point.::: This app was great until 3 weeks ago when it won't give any insights. I'm a premium member and have updated the app but nothing changed or got fixed. It also won't count my steps. I have it synced with my Google fit but nothing. It really need to be fixed.,2

I like it for a period tracker, but advise against using it for pregnancy tracking.",2
254,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Works as well as any decent period tracker, pretty accurate predictions. However, the ""daily insights"" and health assistant popping up everytime I open the app with useless or inaccessable(due to not having premium) advice are very annoying. The app is so cluttered, and there's no way to declutter it or at least make it useful except pay for premium. Very great if you need sexual advice and information, not great if you simply want a good period tracker. I'm moving back to Clue, personally.",2
255,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Used to use this app consistently for years to track when my period was and estimate when I would get it next. I did not use it to track fertility or hormonal changes and rarely would use it to track side effects. When I first started using it, it was great! Now, the ads for premium are overwhelming the app. Each time I open it, premium ad. Nearly all features the app boasts are locked behind premium. All the ads made me finally reach my breaking point, I'm switching tracker apps.",2
256,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Great for tracking but I get spammed so much with push notifications on insights and/or premium membership deals, even though I have tried to turn off all notifications except for cycle reminders. I feel like there's a bug causing my settings to not retain after app updates or something and it's so annoying to the point I'm now looking for an alternative.",2
257,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The app has a great interface, and operates efficiently. My frustration with it and why I uninstalled it is that it provides multiple reminder options that you can toggle on or off. However, it doesn't seem as if they serve any purpose, because I am frequently receiving notifications. I am not trying to get pregnant, so I don't care about ovulation notifications. I also do not care for random advice. I simply want to be notified of when my menstrual cycle is about to start. It's simply annoying.",2
258,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I love(d) Flo! It helped me get pregnant with my baby! Finally returning to the app after having the beebs to start tracking my cycle and wow. If I can even get it to work, the ads are insane. The latency--even after updating and restarting the app multiple times--is over 10s long between button press and the app responding... It's almost unbelievable that what used to be an incredible app is now useless.",2
259,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I used this app for almost a year. I started tracking my periods with it in Oct 2019, and after finding out I was pregnant in March of 2020, I used the pregnancy tracking feature. I did enjoy the app at first and really felt like it was in sync with my body. However, partway through my pregnancy they moved almost every single feature to ""premium"". At one point I couldn't even read the weekly update for my pregnancy. I decided to delete the app, and found one I like better, that is actually free.",2
260,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"There's a pay wall behind pretty much everything except for just putting in when your period starts and stops, which I usually wouldn't mind but you have to click through these walls at least twice everytime you open the app. I can't say for sure because I've never paid for their other features like text help or articles, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's all just information you could look up for free.",2
261,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Would be great for what it's advertised for, if it didn't try to get you to buy premium every time you open the app. Plus, it advertised as an advice and tracking app but fails to mention that you can't even look at any articles without being premium. I used it for a while, but I'm tired of trying to get around the premium subscription boxes every time.",2
262,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app is good, just a lot of content you can't access due to 'premium' limitations and having to buy into the app. I can't go back and say I had a pregnancy and track my postpartum because there isn't an option. You just are treated like a woman without a child. It would be nice if I could add in a birth and start from my first postpartum bleed. Otherwise everything seems to be worth having the app and using it for tracking your period or trying to conceive.",2
263,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Two stars, because this app used to be perfect. I used it for years - probably since around when it was developed. They've added too many notifications with no way to disable the overkill ones without getting rid of the helpful, personal cycle-related ones. I've even emailed the help desk and they said there is no way to get rid of them. They currently send multiple notifications a day. Fix this, and I'll be back.",2
264,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I've been using this app for years and loved it. Now I'm seriously considering uninstalling due to all the push notifications. You. Can't. Turn. Them. Off! I've tried numerous times to do so in the settings. I'm busy. I only want notifications about my period starting soon. That's it! Instead it's daily notifications. Sometimes more than one a day. I don't want to pay for extra stuff I don't want or need just to get the extra notifications to stop.,2
265,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Frustrating. I want to track my period and get a notification when my period will start. Instead, I get daily (or more) push notifications about buying the full version. If I turn these off, I don't get my period notification. And it doesn't seem to ""learn"" from what has been logged. I guessed at my cycle length in the beginning and was off by about a day. It has not corrected this error. While in the app, it nags me about symptoms, which just leads to the pay wall. Gonna find a different app.",2
266,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Ive had this app for years and really liked it. However, recently there are sooooo many ads and pop-ups. It is a nightmare to look at, not mentioning annoying trying to close all of them just to log a simple symptom. I understand they are trying to make money for a great product but please be less invasive???? If people are willing to pay, they will do so with just one notification. If they arent, you can have a million popups, and they still wont. It would just piss potential buyers.",2
267,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Flo has been very helpful in keeping track of my cycle and helping identify where I'm actually at in my cycle. I really enjoyed using this app up until recently when every feature/insight other than basic tracking has been locked behind a paywall, hence the 2 star rating. Tbh I'd probably consider paying even a smaller sub fee for the features I actually use but as of right now the value doesn't match the price. Fantastic app if you're willing to pay, though.",2
268,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I used to love this app for tracking my period. Now they keep pushing their paid version with multiple popups, they have cluttered the home page with daily insight boxes. I preferred the old, simple view. Ive used this app for years to track my period and loved the other tracking features- exercise, sex, water, sleep, emotions + period symptoms. It's just become too busy.",2
269,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've had this app for over a year. It was fantastic, however this most recent update was awful. All the information that was free. A update from some time ago took away some information and gave it to users who paid. Now, for $10/mo., I can get all the information I used to get for free. Some content would be understandable, but now it's the majority. Plus, the layout just *flo*s wrong. Women pay for more. Edit: they took down the weight tracker, too.",2
270,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I USED TO to love this app. It really was my favorite, i checked my review history. Sadly they've now filled it with superfluous amounts of unhelpful info that they pester you continuously to pay for. Also, since I switched phones I can no longer access the free version and years of my personal history. Password reset DOES NOT WORK. Highly disturbing. I've switched back to the ""my calendar"" app, it reminds me of what flo used to be. Why did you have to mess with a great thing!?",2
271,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I decided to try out a new period app, but as someone who is asexual & nonbinary, I had a few issues. The app is very nice and flushed out, despite the ads. But as a more masc presenting person, I found that being unable to change my profile picture from the default girl picture, made me uncomfortable. That & the constant reminder of sex. I have no problem with it, I just wish there was a mode to filter that content, as it doesn't apply to me and is about 75% of the app. It was nice otherwise :/",2
272,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,use to be really good...now it just makes you subscribe and that's really annoying. the app had really great healthy tips and great info on your body changes and stuff for you in the beginning about three years ago almost four. I loved the app and all the info but it's just made it more difficult to know what's going on with your body when you feel somethings up. I rather deal with ads than have to subscribe for an app I use twice a month.,2
273,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Flo technically does what it says it does, tracking your periods and notifying you when they are going to start. However, I found it much too annoying to keep using. I would get daily notifications about random topics that I did not want, and could not turn off. Also, there is little graphicall information about period symptoms, just about cycle length, and then a bunch of other health/wellness metrics. It felt like they were not focusing on periods, which is the point of the app.",2
274,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app used to be my favorite but the constant pop-ups for the premium subscription is awful. Happens essentially every time the page refreshes. Their generic response is that the revenue from premium helps them improve the app. Yes, we get that, but tone down the ads! Make it happen once when you log in or something, not every couple of seconds. It's absurd and I'm currently looking for a different app.",2
275,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It was a good app, until they decided to make premium content and subscriptions. If I wanted more detailed info on the things they offer via subscription, I would simply Google it. I will be looking for a period tracker that doesn't want my money. (Even banner ads would be preferable) Update: I decided to stay with Flo for a while. It has gotten worse!! Now flo is *constantly* sending me notifications, despite disabling every single notification option aside from my actual period reminder",2
276,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I use to really like this app. I used it for over 3 years. I certainly wasn't taking advantage of every feature because I didn't want to pay for premium, but I really appreciated what was available for free..... Until just a few months ago. Now, nearly everything requires premium subscription to use. You can still track your cycles and symptoms, but the health insights are locked tight. And the begging for me to purchase premium is getting annoying. I probably won't keep this app much longer...",2
277,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"You can't view or export reports on Android. The ""insights"" can be useful but they become redundant fast. It is geared towards people with regular cycles and people who want to get pregnant. You can turn the pregnancy stuff off, but it still suggests articals involving pregnancy so if you're infertile or child free its not great. You can't add custom symptoms/mood and the options are limited. Overall seems like it isn't made for a variety of menstruaters.",2
278,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,When I downloaded this a year or two ago it was very insightful and I loved reading all the tips and articles but somewhere along the lines it took away all the free content. I've got a lot of data history so I'm hesitant to switch to something else. It does a good job at predicting periods so if that's all you need it for then great.,2
279,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Most features that stood out against other period trackers aren't free anymore. Even more concerning when some insights say you logged something that may be of concern but when you click on it, you have to pay premium to see it. The ads for premium come up constantly. With the basic user, it's just the same as any other period tracker so keep that in mind unless you don't mind paying for premium.",2
280,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I love this app, it's been really helpful for the past couple of years I've been using it! But lately, the app keeps crashing and glitching. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, hoping to fix anything that the new update caused. But sadly, to no avail. I'd love to continue using this app, because all of my data that I saved is on my account. I would hate to look for another app. Please fix the problem is you can.",2
281,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I used to enjoy using Flo and found it really helpful. Now it's so full of proddings to subscribe to the premium membership that I'm considering deleting my account. I'm content with the features of the free version so I don't want to upgrade, yet I don't want to be inundated with ads when I open the app. Women have always had periods. The period tracker app is a very new concept. I can live without it and enjoy the simplicity of having less tech (and fewer ads!) in my life.",2
282,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've been using this app for about 2 years and it has been so helpful. It gets more accurate the more you use it and honestly its helpful for when you have like a trip and need to see where your period would land. It adapts to your body and the app itself is easy to use so I definitely recommend. Recently though, the ads for the paid version is getting kind of annoying because every time you open the app there is some kind of pop up advertisement",2
283,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I started using this app to track my period and symptoms because I was diagnosed with endometriosis and had started medication. It was fine for what I needed at the moment, tracked my period, symptoms, and ovulation. For whatever reason, they decided to put most of the features behind a pay wall recently. They've become very pushy with their premium version which you need to access most features. It's very off-putting and makes me want to switch to a different app.",2
284,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I am here to echo other reviews after the update: what helped this app stand out from the others was their insight to your logged symptoms, which were helpful and encouraging. Most basic options, such as charts etc, are no longer accessible. Plus, I learned that the only way to disable the enticing push notifications that ultimately led to paywalled content is to disable ALL notifications, which is silly because I look forward to receiving Flo alerts for when my period is almost due.",2
285,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Used it for years. All I ever wanted was a calendar to track my cycle. It's SO frustrating to use with premium popping up all the time. And now? Several times it's forgotten the dates I've logged. I started to doubt myself... Well, I just opened it and found January and December gone, and I remember several weeks ago having to go back and try to remember December and putting it in when I logged January, and now they're both gone and it's a guessing game again. You had ONE job! Uninstall time...",2
286,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I found (and LOVED) Flo several months ago after leaving another app that ""improved"" itself to the point that it was one giant advertisement for a yearly subscription and useless for basic period tracking. Now I'm in the same boat with Flo. It doesn't let you tell it about yourself, so it assumes you're 20 and straight. Before the latest update, at least it didn't put health and sex ""help"" in your face, but now it's front and center, which makes it hugely annoying. I guess the search for a basic and solid period tracking app begins again. I'm sorry for all of you trying to track pregnancies and now faced with paying or getting nothing.",2
287,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app has gotten so incredibly annoying. I have been using it since 2017 and it used to be so straightforward, but now it's way more complicated. It sends me notifications nearly every day, even after I activated settings to stop that. It also has this fake ""chat assistant"" that is incredibly slow to give you the damn information to simulate someone typing, but no one is typing, so it comes off as weirdly condescending. I am actively looking for a different app to switch over to.",2
288,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I am not one to write reviews, but I've been using Flo for over 5 years. The most recent updates have taken away features I've used from the beginning. I'm seriously considering switching to a new app so I can continue to track what I like to track without it suddenly being taken away. The push to upgrade to Pro has gotten annoying and ridiculous. I wish things would change but I highly doubt it.",2
289,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Been using app for 2 years. Accurate and easy to use until recently. When I got pregnant and entered my positive result, the app never recognized my pregnancy and still counted my period as late for 9 months. Anyways, the reason for the 2 star is for the constant popups and ads. These were not here when I first downloaded the app. Irritating to wait for the ad to countdown, so I can click off and finally check my tracker! Constantly bombarded with them and it makes me not want to open the app.",2
290,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The app used to be amazing, the tracker is very accurate and it gave articles to assist you. Ever since they made a premium option all you can do is track your period and you can even get the full report on your cycle anymore! I'm honestly considering finding a new tracker and if you're for something free that does a little more than tracking this isn't the app.",2
291,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It tracks fine. It doesn't seem to adjust all that much from the amount of days you put in for cycle length. I've used this app for 4 years and it used to be much better, but now it's just covered, and I mean COVERED, in buying their premium version. I can't even access my main page for 10 seconds because of the stupid ads that cover my chart. They always pop up right when I click on something and they happen every couple seconds. I'm literally about to uninstall.",2
292,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I originally downloaded this app because it was simple and straightforward. That is no longer the case with constant pop-ups and forcing the chat to open to discuss personal and private issues with a data collection algorithm. I just needed a period tracking to relay accurate info to my private licensed physician. Too many extras have been added with the last couple updates and has made it more difficult to navigate the app for basic information.,2
293,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This was great for a long time. I've used it for a couple years at this point, but the constant nagging to sign up for premium is really annoying. It's not that I really miss the features which used to be available and are now only for subscribers, it's more that every single time I try to use the app it tries to get me to subscribe. The latest update also seems to ignore factors which can alter a period (stress, injury, exercise, etc) and just makes you feel bad if your period is a bit late",2
294,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I used to love the App. It was insightful and full of information. It answered questions to what I had and tracked my period great. However, everything that was free now costs money. They want a subscription which is over $60 a year which is extreme considering we are in a pandemic for one and two ive had the app for over a year or two. Seems like a rip off now. I would charge a one time fee for the app and let it be",2
295,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"As others have said. It was perfect. Then they took features away from long time users for their premium subscription. You might as well write your periods down on a paper calendar. I get you have to make money. But if the premium was to fund more advanced features, you shouldn't take away basic features if we don't subscribe. Also the way the error for predictions comes up, it just looks like it's a malfunction and maybe it will work later but if you click, they shake you down to upgrade.",2
296,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,It is useful for tracking but it has a pop up for premium and it has a pop up for someone to chat with you every single time I get on. It also has constant annoying notifications about random stuff that are not helpful. I wish it would notify me only when my period is about to start. I will be switching to a different app to see if it provides a more minimalist experience.,2
297,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It's a nicely organized app, but you can't make notes or do much besides track the days and if you exceriszed, basically. Not a whole lot with the free version. It's extremely annoying how pushy they are of the premium subscription! Every second pops up an advertisement for paying $15+ a year or $10 a month just to track your period with someone else's opinions! I'm going to find a different app to use that won't shove their subscriptions in my face and gives me what I want. I don't recommend.",2
298,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Used this app for five years now, but the most recent update has made it sooooo annoying to use, everything pushy pushy to upgrade to premium, maybe 3 or four times while normally using the app. Everything mostly behind a pay wall now it seems. Took away some of the symptom tracking options, the flow amount is sometimes there, but mostly not. Even the calendar view seems to not show predictive info sometimes. It's really just all taken the quality and experience waaay down (as a free app)",2
299,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've had this app for 4 plus years. It works great for tracking periods and pregnancies. The weight tracker has always been a pain and difficult to read, but they seemed to have done away with weight input altogether. Now, the only place to put my weight is in the notes. This means my weight is no longer added to the tracker, and the weight tracking chart is now useless.",2
300,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Yes it's a period tracker but most features are premium which can be really inconveniencing because they are very much helpful, I'd really love it if they let all users get all the features for a better FLO app!",2

I gave a second app a look, intending to use them together, only to find out that ovulation windows are completely different between the apps. I checked with several sources and found that, by blindly trusting Flo with my ovulation predictions, I may have screwed myself over for an entire year. How is it that Flo's prediction software is so wrong?! I've cancelled my subscription and am fully moving over.",2
302,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Brilliant app when you pay for it but I refuse to pay for another period affiliated product. Condoms are free but I have to pay for sanitary products and then this app wantse to pay just to keep in check with/ and explore myself? Absolutely not. I'll just up with what I already have to pay for. Aaaaaand they collect all of the data we upload on our cycles for studies - if anything flo should be paying US!,2

305,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"great at tracking, but no option to hide pregnancy related things. ""Sterile"" and ""gay"" are not available choices as birth control options. And the ""secret chat"" area meant for finding community and solace is FULL of Christian purity and sex shaming culture. There appears to be little to no moderation as well, so good luck if you have any religious trauma. If it's not religion or purity culture, it's complaining about men as a whole. Fix it up, Flo.",2

308,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I used this app for years and loved it before. Now so much has been taken away. You have pay more for less and their ads are so agressive. I used to have years worth of cycle history and all I wanted was the statistics of my cycle length , now they erased all that (to my horror) and you can only see the last 6 months. Every time you want to check something, you bombarded by ads for premium stuff. Gone is the simple reliable app I used for years and now I am looking for a new app.",2
309,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Flo used to be a good fit for me in years past, to track period dates and view ovulation days. It also gave decent info about my babies growth stages during my last 2 pregnancies. But within the last year, it has been overwhelmingly advertising its premium subscription. And some of the locked content hidden behind the sub service has images and titles that are so sexual! I understand that this is an app for women, but is it really necessary to be so lewd? Hunting for a new app now!",2

323,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Used to love the app, but now I hate that I keep getting pop ups for premium service! What makes me really mad is that I did have it at one time for a discounted price (15$ a year) and was then canceled on me out of nowhere way before it was due for a renewal. And that discounted price I got was supposed to last a lifetime when I got it 2 years ago. Now if I want to use it, I have to pay 40$ a year. Seriously? Thanks flo for capitalizing on tracking our periods🙃",2

331,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Used this app about 9-10 years ago and always thought it was great. Even used it to track my pregnancy. It was great! But now I'm having weird periods even though I've been on an IUD for 5 years. Remembered about it and then I find out you have to pay for it?! I'm sad :(,2
332,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Literally will only track your daily symptoms, and nothing else. Good if u only want it for that. But really annoying how many notifications u receive. Even through email. App offers a lot but it all costs money. Trying to con you into paying by telling u that u might be sick because of some of the symptoms u put down, they try to get u to pay to speak to a doctor over symptoms that are quite normal and common. Money hungry, annoying app. I do not have money, I cannot use this app.",2
333,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Over the years I've used this app, it has become 3 things: inaccurate, misleading, and extremely aggressive. Every second you use this app, it pushes its expensive premium subscription onto you in some way or another. Upon opening, it gives you pop-ups for an AI assistant that Flo admits is unreliable. Additionally, the way they log and predict your symptoms and periods has become more complex and yet I find that it's predictions do not adjust to new data and are inaccurate 60-70% of the time.",2
334,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,This app is alright but not able to start free trial at all without a credit or debit card sucks.,2
335,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"waaaaayyyyy too many popups, very messy, constantly screaming in your face to buy the subscription. although, it has been my app of choice for more than 3 years now. i like that you can log the type of discharge and symptoms, and the predictions are fairly good.",2

337,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Its okay...but If you want to do anything you got to pay for it and That's kind of annoying,2
338,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Please add a Birth Control option. I used to take the pill to skip periods. Now my app is scaring me about my irregular periods after birth control. This is annoying enough to discontinue using the app. -I stopped taking the pill thus putting reminders to take it is not helpful...,2
339,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It gets the job done but my god are the constant pop ups for the premium subscription annoying as hell. Why send me a notification for a feature that's for premium users?? Everything, even the articles on the main page are for premium users apparently. If I can't use them, at least give me the option to turn them off. I'm honestly disappointed.",2
340,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,the app is pointless for partners because there is no ability for the man to see the symptoms and the future cycle of the partner. which is the entire point why I tried it. I could care less about non penatrative sex ideas that a quick Google search would lead me to. Allow more information to be shared between partners and maybe I'll try this again. So glad that there's a free trial so I didn't pay $40 to answer a question that I can just ask.,2
341,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Good,2
342,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The chat message for the users is generated which is annoying and doesn't let you express yourself or tell them what is the issue is because you can't type your challenges and problems. Can it be fixed, it is really pissing? Thank you",2

I purchased the subscription 1 day and by the next day I asked for a refund and that was from December 27,2023 and I have reached out to the support team and Google play and I still have not received my refund even after cancelling the subscription and deleting the app and requesting a refund 3 times.

349,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Flo used to be such an excellent app, now it feels more like a sex education app. Way too much irrelevant information splattered across the screen when you're just trying to track your cycle and view your cycle summary (why do I have to scroll to the bottom of the home page for this?!). Not to mention having to pay to access a majority of the app. The ONLY reason I still use it is because it has a nice UI.",2
350,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app used to be great. Unfortunately, the recent update has completely ruined the app for me. I wanted this app as a simple period tracker. However, the app has become so sexual! It's not even about tracking periods anymore. It's about tracking your sex life and pregnancy. As a teenager, I just want to track my cycle. Also, the ads for purchasing a subscription are constant and annoying. I'm not inclined at all to purchase the premium version. Overall, this app has become a disappointment.",2
351,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,first time but still looking towards Flo app,2
352,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,The only part it does for free is track your period. Everything else has a fee. There really is nothing on Flo that can help you for free without paying.,2
353,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,It's really good for ladies. There's no problem even if you don't remember your mentrual cycle start day. Flo will make it easy.,2
354,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Too many ads to upgrade. Good to use only to track periods,2

I'm off BC now so I thought I'd re-download it. I loved the articles and discussions, but not enough for 7.99 a month. And it asks you to subscribe everytime you touch something. This app was so good for women, but now it's just another subscription hungry company.",2

364,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,ok,2
365,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Nothing is free, it's has so many features that are locked and is trying to make me go premium to pay them 40$ a year. The only thing it does it tracks menstrual cycles on a virtual calander. You can't even change your avatar in the app for free!",2
366,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Y'all took $100 for an app I'm not using. Plus it's hard to cancel the subscription for the app. I had to go through loops just to cancel and get my refund back. Your customer service is amazing by way.,2
367,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The tracker part with the symptoms log etc is ok. But the fact that EVERYTHING else is premium is frustrating. As if as a woman, we don't pay enough for having a period! I get it's a business but some things could be free, maybe an article a day. Especially as it wants to bombard me with subsequently useless notifications everyday. So far, a bit of a glorified calendar which my watch app can do for free.",2
368,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Loved this app, had it for nearly 3 years with premium but I just got a new phone and it wouldn't allow me to log in and never sent me a rest password email. I'm now using the app with premium (I think) but I've lost all of my previous data. I have tried contacting flo and it just takes you to an online form and no one got in touch with me.

372,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The app has so many pop ups telling you to buy the premium version, it constantly wants to tell you how to get pregnant and about sex. It sends me notifications despite me having all notifications except period reminders off. I used to have an apple phone, and I used the built in period tracker. This is worse in every way except its availability on android phones. It also for some reason refused to allow me to use the app without creating an account.",2

375,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I just downloaded it. Can't verify email, it keeps giving an error message.",2
376,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Can't really do anything without paying money.,2
377,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Really like this app, which I pay for, but.. The new contraception reminder/planner seems great, exactly what I wanted, but pretty worthless when it doesn't show up on your calendar in any way, and you have the notifications off and it doesn't tell you.. considering using a different app and canceling if they don't fix this.",2
378,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I love the feature of being able to see your partner's cycle and join under the same subscription, I just wish I could see more of what symptoms she is tracking, and a more tailored version of the partner tracker instead of just seeing the same ""most people feel like this when they are on their period.""",2
379,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Hate this silly app!! Everything is paywalled but they lead you on for like a minute before revealing that its not free! I know it's just graphic design but the the ui having the motif of texting 💅 and emojis ♥️ and social media feels almost misogynistic 😭 the fact they make you click ""yes queen im ready to commit to flo 😁🎷😇🤪"" and stuff like that to use the app feels so patronizing 💀 the tracking itself is fine but there are other apps that do that without giving the user a lobotomy",2
380,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I've been using Flo for a long time and used to love it. Something changed recently where you can't get ANY insights at all unless you pay to upgrade. I'll be looking for another app to use..,2
381,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I have the free version, which is all I need. The app has tracked my cycle with accurate predictions after only 2 cycles. I have a shorter cycle which I found surprising. I find the notifications on the app really frustrating. I've asked it to only notify me before my period is about to start but I get notifications every single day. I also find the pop up chat annoying, I try and close it but it'll open and I cant learn anything from it because its for premium.",2
382,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Tired of the amount of time it takes to load up the app because the promotional pop ups keep coming up as soon as I open up the app. It's not something I want, slows me down and is unnecessarily annoying. Can we have an option to switch off the pop ups upon opening the app?",2
383,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Edit: I get so. Many. Full screen pop ups for their articles when I try to do ANYTHING. Its annoying! Especially because Ive read half of them already! Ill probably cancel my subscription and try a different app at this point. The new layout, especially the symptoms menu, is a bit clunky to navigate. Also a lot of the informationtexts seem to expect me to try for a child (like it's something bad that this symptom means that im probably not pregnant etc) which is weird+uncomfortable for me.",2
384,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The app hasn't been working properly for the last week, none of the widgets are displaying. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling and even though I've logged into my account all my information for the last 6 months is missing.",2

386,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Been using the app for years. I don't like the new update because they removed some of the features and repeat cards. I can't find the symptom tracker in the neww layouts even thkugh I pay for the full version for a few years now... but I'm looking for a better app now because I don't like the new changes.,2
387,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I had quite high hopes for this app. It really did help me. But there is no dark mode, straining my eyes whenever i open it. Im quite angry that iPhone has more background options. I read through the reviews and most of the replies from Flo say that they would be bringing them back mid-way 2023 (which has already passed) or *soon*. WHAT IS SOON? Please give a date where flo will be bringing back dark mode because i dont see you guys ""trying to make things better"" at all.",2
388,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Good,2
389,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Very limited info unless u paying for premium.,2
390,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,It's good but I don't get to have insights. I have shared the app but I still have not been given premium services. It make the app super boring.,2
391,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I can't even use this app because I'm broke! Make this app free for everyone to use! I will be deleting this app until you do so,2
392,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It was really working well for about a year, I had recorded all my symptoms and my dates and there were an educational part in the app where you can see other people experience with their period. Slowly, that part was removed and then suddenly after I completed the one year mark , my data was all lost and I had no access to anything. That was so disappointing. I deleted the app but I hope you work on that part because it was really a good one",2
393,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Most of the stuff on there you have to pay xtra 4 so,2
394,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,The app is okay. If you don't pay the subscription then it's kinda useless. I was charged for the subscription when I was supposed to be given a free trial.,2
395,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"There are simply too many intrusive pop-ups, ads, upsells, etc. Launch the app, there's a two page upsell. Mark a symptom, another upsell. Initiate a period and want to check some things, nope, there's the Flo assistant pop-up with the same conversation tips you've already seen. If you're a free user you will spend more time dismissing popups and dialogues than navigating through the actual app. Used to be really good but there's absolutely no ease of flow (haha) when using the app.",2
396,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I used to love this application it was so helpful, but recently, it's not saving my period dates. That's very annoying because i was waiting for the app to tell me how many days left for my 1st date, now it got useless for not saving all the info.",2
397,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Used to love this app, now every time I open it I'm bombarded with pop ups to pay for premium, and everything I click except the basic tracker prompts me to pay for premium.",2
398,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I have been trying to contact support about some issues...but no answer...now...I got charged $100 dollars. For something I can not use and don't want...app is okay, but need better way of communicating with customers. Now I'm having to contact my bank about this issue and blocking them.",2
399,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I'm trying to contact the developer thru email to ask for my refund but until now there's no progress. I already cancelled subscription and deleted the app so that I have no chance to use this app anymore. That's why I'm asking for my refund. Anyone here who can help me where to follow up my request? I badly needed my refund. I hope you understand.,2
400,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Updated review: No support. Contact 4x via email. Nothing. They lost my data. Loved until it stopped. I used it monthly and it helped so much when I needed to understand trends. I got a new phone and am now locked out and getting any support is ridiculously hard. I don't think there are actually people behind this app, at least I can't find one that doesn't repeat what's on their FAQ.",3
401,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Still my go to tracking app. The interface is user friendly and simple enough to understand. However, I initially got this app BEFORE the subscription update. It was amazing then. Great track. Helpful info. Mostly positive community. The paywall, in my opinion, really hurt the overall usefulness of the app. I feel like 90% of the information available is now locked behind that wall. And I just don't know how much of the information is worth the cost.",3
402,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"If you aren't going to buy the app to access all that is there don't get this and just download a simple tracker. I downloaded this to compare it to one that I've had for years. I'm able to log my periods, but logging symptoms is a little confusing at first. To read the articles or use any of the pop-up features they advertise, you need to pay. It's kinda teasing. It's just a lot going on in the app which you don't get to use anyways. I rather just use my old one without having so much going on.",3
403,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Very user friendly for tracking your period and has a lot of good info. The main thing I don't like is there needs to be an option for people who are not sexually active. I get tired of it accusing me of not being in the mood and giving me fertility tips. Also, the upsell for the subscription is very annoying. Every time I do anything in the app it tries to get me to subscribe. Otherwise a good app.",3
404,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Great app if you want to know about your body better, but DO NOT put your card info in at all for a free trial because if you do not cancel before it's over they will charge you and will not refund you. $40 for the year for something I'm not going to use, and they've offered cheaper during my investigating it a bit. Not happy about that.",3
405,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Love the app but poor customer service. I was unable to access my premium (paid) account for nearly a month after multiple attempts to reach customer support through every possible channel. It took multiple follow-ups and a mention of a possible refund to finally get a response. Not getting support for multiple weeks is unreasonable.,3
406,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Useful app but the ""assistant"" is the most annoying, useless, waste of money AI I've ever dealt with. The pop ups are more like a punishment than a feature. It can never tell you anything more useful than you can look up on the internet. The app itself would get 4 stars but the ""assistant"" makes the use of the app so much less enjoyable. Also, the toxic positivity jesus talk (trust in the savior and you'll get pregnant!) in the forums is super gross and there's no way to filter it out.",3
407,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It used to have a lot more for free, then accidentally signed up for more, then cancelled and basically nothing is free but the forums and logging your period and ovulation. Great app, if you pay, sucks otherwise to take everything away. If you have a miscarriage, it doesn't understand and will badger you about adding your period and give tips during your healing period. They didn't do well preparing for that, even though it's such a common thing.",3
408,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app was perfect when I first began using it. Now, not so much. Good for tracking your monthly cycle but inaccurate with the ovulation timeline. It used to show a 10 day fertility window, now it only shows a 7 day window during the present month. Once the month is over and you go back to check the previous months, it goes back to showing a 10 day fertility window. That's not very helpful when you're trying to conceive. Please fix this issue....",3
409,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I loved this app! I've used it for yrs but the past few months it's become less helpful as the insights and articles have disappeared. I feel as though if you don't pay for the premium subscription (which some people can't fit it in their budget) you get the bare minimum when it comes to features & information. It's basically an additional calendar on my phone since then. It is still helpful but nothing compared to what it used to be. Unfortunately I'm considering searching for another app.,3
410,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I used to really like this app but all of the sudden the reminders and notifications stopped functioning. I'm not sure why this is. I really only use it to track my cycle and get reminders for my medications but now that one of two things aren't working there isn't really a point in keeping this app. Most other features you have to pay for, so if you're interested in that then I reccommend it.",3
411,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The app itself is great, easy to navigate, easily track symptoms but the only issue I have is that barely anything is free! None of the videos, articles or insights are free, the only things that is free is the tracker and chats. And I understand trying to make money but some people can't afford memberships.",3
412,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,The chats are often repetitive and don't really offer new info. I also feel annoyed every time the app tells me it's too soon to take a test. I have irregular periods and want to be able to test whenever I want and log it without getting a lecture. The logs and tracking are nice. The community is nice.,3
413,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Overall, the app is fine. Flo does what it is supposed to do. However, it seems almost impossible to do the most simple of things without some in-app pop-up trying to get you to buy premium access. The ""health assistant"" pops up every time you go to a new screen, and there are almost always 2 premium pop-ups with difficult to find exit buttons. I would just like to be able to track a period without all the extra effort.",3
414,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Editing my review. I liked it on the one hand: even without premium, it fit my needs, which was just to track period and ovulation. It was pretty accurate as well. However, I do not like how many nearly pornographic photos there are for the different articles. And since seeing the ""Ethical Guide to Porn"" posted, I have decided to delete this app. I find its views on sex morally wrong, and do not wish to be continually shown other people's bodies in sexual positions.",3
415,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I used this app for about a year. We were using BBT as a passive birth control method and I loved their charting system for that. However, after I had my baby and wanted to get started with temping again, I find that they have removed the option to track your temperature. I'm very disappointed, as I love this app ( with a premium subscription) for everything else.",3
416,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Used to love it, now it's over the top with extra ""features"" that clutter up the interface and interrupt when all you're trying to do is enter a period date in the calendar. There are unskippable ads every time you open the app or try to leave the main screen. I like the long list of symptoms you can choose from, and the calendar itself works well. But I don't want all these extra things that weigh the app down. I'm switching to a simpler app.",3
417,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Im torn with this review. I loved the Flo tracking app! It gave me great articles to read and was really accurate in period tracking for me, since my periods can be a little irregular because of my birth control. I used it when it was totally free, but that was a little over a year ago, now you have to pay for it!! I think that's terrible, and unnecessary especially since it's an app for promoting both awareness and self care for women. I sadly will not be downloading again.",3
418,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Super easy for tracking period, ovulation, and all associated symptoms. The health assistant is a great tool, giving personalized advice about your cycle and any symptoms you enter. However, it's extremely limited unless you get premium, but on premium the health assistant didn't show up at all for me. So don't count on actually using that feature until it's fixed.",3
419,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Been using this app for a few years. This app is sorely missing a search function, more graphs to help ID patterns in a useful way, and an export function to share/review data with my doctor. I'm manually importing data from a web-based tracker I used in the early 2000s, and it had more nuanced tracking and search functionality. I'd like to see these features. I'd also like to see cycle exclusion (like Clue has), so the gaps in my tracking over the years do not impact my predictions.",3
420,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The premium version is making a once great app look horrible! You took away free features for premium! You stated it was going to be $10/month after a 1 month trial, now it's $16/year after a 3 month trial. A price reduction is a good start, but I still haven't found anything listing features between free & premium. I wouldn't mind trying the 3 month trial as issues are worked on, but how will I see the difference to make my decision? I understand needing funding. Why not run small ads?",3
421,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I have used this app to track my cycle for over two years, and for that function it earns five stars. However, after an update I can't pinpoint, the app now pushes repeated and annoying notifications. There is no in-app setting to turn these off, and I can't disable them globally either--I rely on the app's once-monthly automated warning that my period is approaching. (After all, the whole reason I have a period tracker app is to automate the tracking of my period!) Very frustrating.",3
422,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It works great for tracking my period but the insights are mostly on premium. I get two slides saying ""here's a tip"" then the next slides are blocked. That's not helpful at all! At least let me watch an ad to continue to see the next sides instead of trying to force me to pay for something I can't afford/don't need in full. It's really not beneficial to only provide half of the information. Ex: [Tender breasts?] [Here's a vague reason] [give me moneyyy!] How about [watch an ad for more info] 💁",3
423,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I used this app for tracking my abnormal periods for several years and it was very helpful for identifying patterns long term and helped me become more aware of pre-period symptoms to look out for. However, as time has progressed, it seems all the extra features of the app (articles and the customized advice) are locked behind the paid subscription wall. The subscription ads have become annoying and since the newest look update, there is no longer a weight tracker.",3
424,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I used this for a few years and loved it. Now, it feels SO intrusive with all the in-app ads for their premium services and their notifications. I turned off all notifications in the app because they keep sending notifications for their extra features, but I STILL keep getting notifications. I had to completely turn off notifications for the app through my phone app settings. It is basically adware now. I will be finding a new app.",3
425,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I like the app and the ability to easily track my cycle, but I am frustrated by the latest update. Before when on the main screen I could easily see my logged BBT and weight underneath my cycle day. I could easily flip through the days and see how it changed. Now I have to go into log my symptoms, and click the graph to see my BBT changes (which does not show the numbers). I am a numbers person and want to easily be able to see them. I don't understand why the feature disappeared.",3
426,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Do not like the new Flo. I have used Flo for years. It was the best period tracker . It was very accurate in tracking period and ovulation. I loved the simplicity and accuracy. I had to uninstall the app due to issues with my phone. Well when I re installed the app where the hell did all these pop ups come from. I understand sometimes you want to change up (upgrade) your brand but come on now the purpose of the app is drowned. Bring back the old Flo.,3
427,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The app is great and the tracking is usually spot on for me. The last year or so the pop up ads are RIDICULOUS. Nearly rendering the app unusable. You think you're going to open it up quick to log the start of your period. Well you're not because you have to wade through a bombardment of ""chats"" and ads before you can even do that. I don't need any additional features and essentially use this app as a calender. The sheer amount of ads definitely detracts from the app experience.",3
428,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This really makes me sad but I think I'm switching apps. It helps keep track of my periods and luckily it's never made me miss a cycle or anything. I also really enjoyed those little ""secret chats"". However, everytime I came across an issue, I'd have to pay for premium which pretty much ruins my experience when before it would let me know whats wrong :// I understand yall wanting money to grow but it's way overbudget for some of us.",3
429,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Have used this app for several years and up until now how loved it. The new update has changed a lot of things that I'm not a fan of, the biggest being that it no longer says if my period is late. In the old version is would say for example ""3 days late"" on the home screen, and the calendar would show when my period was supposed to come. Now if I'm late the calendar just pushes my start date back to a different day. Very frustrating. When tracking I would like to KNOW when I'm late.",3
430,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've had this app for a long time! It was beautiful and simple to use. It really helped me stay aware of my hormones and shifting moods, through multiple birth controls. However, the recent switch to a very pushy subscription model has been annoying at best. New features (it has stories!) clutter the UI. Notifications used to be reserved for upcoming periods are now used to tell you can buy a flo premium sub for your friends. While I'm sure thats configurable, I hate the direction it's taking.",3
431,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Used to be amazing. After they started charging for things it became very frustrating. The app is designed beautifully and easy to use with helpful tips and insites, but the insights cost to use now and thats the best part in my opinion. Very easy to use and easy to log symptons just don't like that they charge for what used to be free.",3
432,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I really enjoyed this app for tracking/calendar purposes. It did what I needed it to. But recently every time I open the app, I have to go through what feels like a lot of timed ads (for upgrades) to just put in some quick information. Recently I've been getting a lot of unwanted notifications too. I think I'm going to have to start using a different app. It's really disappointing because I liked this one.",3
433,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It's a great way to track your period and the different themes you can choose are pretty neat, too, though it was better before they started charging you for things that uses to just be included in it by default. I understand that they need money to continue working on it, though. Overall it's easy to use and pretty good for a period tracker app.",3
434,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Used this for years. I have repeatedly attempted to turn off superfluous notifications, especially about offers and Premium-locked information, yet the app continues to send them to me. Today I got a notification about orgasms right on my phone where anyone could see, including my STUDENTS. It also hardly ever sends me the notifications I ask for about the start of my period. Yeah, it'll track and predict my period, but I'm sick of all the extraneous stuff, so I'm switching to a different app.",3
435,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I went down two stars because of all the pop ups. TONS of half advice/questions based on what data you previously entered. It' good information,BUT to have it pop up SO MUCH,then the advice stops halfway,saying you get more if you pay. I get you have a great product so $. BUT you make it annoying with pop ups that come up even when I turn off notifications. I've had trouble tracking my periods sometimes I have had irregular periods too. This app helps you track everything to do with your cycle.",3
436,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It's extremely unclear that there's a free option. It looks like you have to do a pro trial, which actually signs you up to pay for a subscription once the trial is over. The only way to not do this is to click an easy-to-miss X in the upper left corner. But, this stupid popup will keep popping back up in your face every time to return to the app. It looks like the free version only lets you log your period and symptoms. ""Fertility Friend"" is a better free option.",3
437,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It's a decent period tracker. The UI is very nice to use and look at, with a lot of customization options. I've been using this app for a long time and the tracking is usually off by a day or two but overall mostly accurate. The biggest downside is the constant pushing for the premium subscription and the tons of content that's locked behind it. Overall, if you can deal with the pay walls and advertising it's pretty decent.",3
438,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I loved this app until they started constantly showing you articles to help you conceive or manage periods but in order to read them you have to upgrade and pay monthly. I plan on keeping because it's user friendly and I'm able to track periods, symptoms and temperature easily (I use this for natural birth control). But I'm disappointed that as of recent, anytime I log a symptom, they ask you to upgrade at a high price tag.",3
439,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've been using this app for years and it's been really useful in tracking and understanding my cycle better. My favorite part of the app was being able to use the widget (Android), but suddenly it has disappeared from my home screen and is no longer a widget option. Please bring that back- the widget made it easy to remember to log my information every day. My only other complaint is the incessant push to upgrade to Premium. No thank you!",3
440,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I'm having problems getting my data analyzed. It's been 30 minutes and it's still analyzing. I have pictures to show the timestamps. I tried re installing the app and it erased my predicted period and ovulation dates. I wanted to give this app a 5 star rating. Because of how well the progress was going. But after this mishap, I decided to go with the 3 star. If this can be fixed, then I will reconsider.",3
441,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I like it for what it is and tracking stuff. But it doesn't track movement accurately. I've had it in a stroller while pushing and it didn't get counted. So very irritating when your trying to get extra steps. And apparently walking isn't considered a form of exercise since that isn't an option listed. I don't find the insights helpful either. It's very biased and sometimes inaccurate. There should be more options for moods as well.,3
442,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I agree with many other recent reviews. I really enjoyed this app but since they've been pushing hard to switch to premium it's not as good. Maybe listen to us that don't have, need, or want the premium and stop pushing SO hard for us to pay for a period tracking app. I'd hate to stop using it but removing some of the free features to the premium service was a bad move. Having part of a health insight then not the rest is pointless. Just be upfront that option is avail to premium users only.",3
443,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I just want an app that tells me when my period is coming. This used to do that and it was fantastic. Now I get notifications for everything except that. I get multiple notifications every day for everything except to tell me that my period is due. I've turned off notifications in the app. I've turned them off on my phone. I've emailed help. I'm out of ideas. I don't want to throw away years of tracking data but if I check my buzzing phone one more time and see it's a Flo blog I'm uninstalling.,3
444,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Really great app to track your cycle and can keep track of a lot of symptoms. The only downside is that there are so many ads for the premium version- ""hey that thing you logged is super concerning"" ""learn more?"" ""oops, no. upgrade"". I only keep it at this point because I've logged so many cycles that the predictions are really accurate. tl;dr love the app, hate the constant ads",3
445,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The best menstrual cycle tracking app, for tracking more than just your period. I use it to learn how different phases of my cycle affect me. However, the ads for premium when you open the app are very annoying. I do not want to pay $7.99/month for the premium features. I wish there was an option to pay a few bucks for this app without the ads and no premium features.",3
446,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've been using this app for years now, and used to really love it. Recently, they've changed to app to push their subscription model, and it's gotten to the point where the basic stuff I want to do in the app is harder to do, and their upsell content takes up space. Generally, I'm not opposed to paying for apps that are worth it, but $50/year really doesn't seem worth what you get, and the reminders to try are really annoying. Today, I ended up downloading another app to track my period.",3
447,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Was working fine, suddenly crashes upon open, can't access my history. Did appreciate clear calendar view, flow light/heavy & vaginal discharge tracker, it helped me start to notice that, but too many symptoms now cluttering up menu. Should be able to hide some or at least manually move them to end of list, or maybe auto-move them there if I gray them out, so don't have to scroll through n/a options to get to what I want. Also, not bad but weirdly had a ""no symptoms"" option, lol, redundant!",3
448,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,The app tracks periods which is great. The last 6 months the app has really pushed to purchase a subscription. I understand it's how it keeps running and makes money. I just feel slightly annoyed that it pushes so hard and has started to take away from some of the free information it use to give. It seems every update gives less and less for the free version and just keeps pushing more and more for a monthly subscription.,3
449,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It's great for tracking, but you cannot use any resources in the app with paying for a monthly subscription. I can litterally Google of the information myself for free, it's just convenient to have it in one place. I would rather watch ads before reading an article or something. The monthly amount keeps going down (I assume I am not the only one who doesn't want another subscription to pay for) so I don't see the point.",3
450,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I'd been using Flo for over a year. I used to like it a lot; it's accurate and has a lot of useful features. However, lately it's been more aggressive at pushing/advertising the premium subscription, to the point I feel like I'm being spammed every time I open it. I'm going to be switching apps. Worth it if you're using all of the features I guess, but wouldn't recommend for just tracking.",3
451,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Great if you aren't recently postpartum. I enjoyed the articles, tips, and the ability to track many different symptoms. But I am about 18 months postpartum, and breastfed for about 16 of those months. There was no way to indicate this is the reason my cycle may be messed up. My doctor is not concerned but the app is! I wish the app would stop telling me that infrequent cycles is something to be concerned about with no way to indicate a recent baby.",3
452,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I have used this app for years and have loved it. However, I am going to uninstall and look into a new app because Flo has been pushing way too many notifications and ads. I have all the extra notifications turned off other than my reminders, but I still get ads for the premium and other ""helpful tips!!"" which I don't want at all. I get nearly 10 notifications a day about that stuff, and all I want is my period and birth control reminders, that is it!",3
453,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"the app runs cleanly, and is user friendly and attractive, but I wish it were more adaptable. for example, it would be really helpful if I could add additional moods or symptoms, or at least edit the existing ones. there's a short selection of stock activities, moods, and symptoms. (breast ""pain"" is an option, but not tenderness, and those are wildly different things in my mind. walking/hiking are not listed activities.) let's see more options to personalize!",3
454,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It's a pretty accurate tracke I've been using for years. My biggest complaint is, in the last year, they have started this constant bombardments for upgrading to the premium. I'm hormonal and short tempered. I just want to log my period and get back to feeling miserable, I don't want to figure out where the hidden close button is just so I can get in to the app.",3
455,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app has been very helpful. I've never been good at tracking my cycle and this app has really helped do that for me. The only issues are the really expensive subscription for premium. I can't afford that on an app. Also, the pedometer is sometimes very off. I walk a distance I know is 5 miles and it says 13 miles instead. Not helpful when I want to manage physical activity.",3
456,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"2020 Update: Issue not fixable as the instructions don't work on my phone, but changed review back. Original: It would be nice if I could easily see what the flow of light medium and heavy is rather than posting it in a long gone article. I wish a history of the accuracy of the app is available, because my periods are usually consistent, but when on the rare occasion it predicts inaccurately, it would be nice if it lets me know how far away from the prediction I could be based on the past.",3
457,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"As much as I love this app, and it's accuracy... I'm only giving it 3 stars. As a woman who doesn't have a flow, or has an extremely light flow (but still gets all of the other symptoms of menstruation), it's incredibly annoying to not have the option of ""no flow"" & ""extra light flow"". Heck, it even fluctuates across a few hours. I've written in requesting to see these options added, but have been ignored, so until they actually decide to include them, I'll be sticking with my 3-star rating.",3
458,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It was a good app.. i mean it does the job if you log your cycle correctly and consistently. However since the upgrade , I feel like I can't access anything without the ""premium subscription "" I get it ... thats what they are supposed to do to make you want it but its to the point where navigating the app is getting annoying and pointless. Could just use another basic tracker without all the internal ""sly"" ads.",3
459,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"So far, I really like this app. It has a clean interface, you can customize what you track, and the insights are really helpful. What I don't like is the premium system. I think that it makes some information less accessible. While I realize that the app has to make money, maybe the premium articles could be ones where you can watch an ad to unlock it, or you can pay for premium and get all the premium articles without an ad?",3
460,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've been using this app for over 2 years now and it was great back then. Ever since they upgraded and got premium the user experience has gone down so much. I just like to log and track things and it used to be so quick and easy but every 5 seconds now you get prompted with an 'upgrade to premium' 'look at this premium feature' to the point where it takes so long to just try to mark one thing. You have great content, but when I hit X on something I expect it to close and not keep popping up",3
461,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It was really easy to use. I lost some of my period history when I got a new phone, but I was able to manage. It helped with logging and tracking so that I had the info for my doctors visits. I used to be able to read articles and get good and useful info. After premium I couldn't read a single article any more, and that was a little upsetting. I ended up deleting it, the article and tracking both periods and my health was a huge plus for me.",3
462,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Used to be better. The ads for premium are really annoying. When I open Flo, I'm just trying to put information in there before I forget it, often on the go. The, sometimes multiple, reminders to try premium, that take up the whole screen, are distracting and obnoxious. Plus, telling me there might be something wrong with my health and baiting me with a report I can start reading but need to pay to finish is so scummy. Considering uninstalling.",3
463,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I do like this app and it's helpful, but I don't think it really tries to improve it's predictions at all, which is disappointing. However, I've gotten better at doing that myself since this has encouraged me to pay more attention to my health. However, since I switched phones (which tells me if apps are still using battery) I've noticed it keeps uaing battery even when I close it down fully, meaning I have to force close it every time I use it. It also gives me tons of annoying notifications.",3
464,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Suuuuper handy tool, but recently, it seems that the majority of the app just clickbaits you into something that only works if you have the premium version. Similarly, one of its main features, the flow assistant, is supposed to give you individualized insights. But it has literally never actually given me any useful information.",3
465,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Its ok tracks your period as long as you don't have to uninstall or reset anything... why bother signing into an app if it doesn't actually keep track. Have had to sign in about 4 different times for various reasons and it makes you start over each time... Now that they have a ""paid subscription "" it is VERY basic service. Meh... REPLY TO FLO HEALTH INC.: Not true... I have done this and it never works... I am 45 years old and can figure out how to properly sign in to an app. It ALWAYS restarts",3

467,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The app is OK. There are some nice graphics and videos, but there are lots of missing symptom options, the content provided is sometimes irrelevant or outdated to when it would have been useful for the user, and most importantly, I seldom see any major updates to the content or interface of the application, suggesting that development is rather slow and they don't often accommodate for user feature requests.",3
468,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The biggest downside is you have to pay for even the basic stuff & it doesn't outright advertise that. Plus it's actually really expensive for an app that you don't even talk to a real person on.

There are other period trackers that do the same thing with faaaaar less aggressive ad tactics.",3

It used to be really accurate and actually helped me conceive twice earlier this year, but they must have changed something, because now like once a week, when I open the app my fertility date change and period dates change. It's been like that for the last two months. It really annoying, so I had to switch to a whole different app. It just doesn't seem reliable anymore.",3
471,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I have been using Flo for a couple of years now. It was one of my favorite applications. Logging your period is simple. However, they push the premium features so hard. The premium is great if you want to pay $40/year for all the extras. But it feels like all the extras have invaded the most basic, originally free services. You can't log in without the app asking you to purchase something. I get they need the money, but can't you put a ""donate"" button so if we give you money, you'll stop asking?",3
472,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Loved this app until recently. It stopped pulling in my active, sleep and steps from Google fit. I have reinstalled both apps and still nothings working. it also freezes whenever I try to switch from the calendar to the daily windows.

Also love the notification for your ovulation prediction.",3
473,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app works well for tracking normal periods. One of the curses of having PCOS is that my periods are completely unpredictable, so as far as Flo being able to predict my period, it's impossible.

I think the subscription isn't worth it however.",3
474,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Coming back to edit my 5 star down to a 3 because of the constant (and I mean constant) ads and pop ups for you to purchase a membership. The articles they try to sell to you look and read like the first article you click on when Googling the most basic period symptom.

No way near worth that much to me...im canceling. Sorry.",3

The app has become super freaking annoying with how much it tries to get you to interact with all the different chats. I used to plug in my symptoms to track them.

The amount of ads pushing the premium product is obnoxious to the point I am looking for another tracking app. I also would love it if a period app would be sensitive to fertility issues, miscarriages and the such.

492,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I like the virtual feedback chats for when you log certain things, but hate that most of them, after a certain point, require you to make in-app purchases to go any further and don't give you any other options. so many times, I've had chat dialogues that are actually relevant to myself and that i wanna learn from, but they withhold that important info from you until you buy. Very disappointed.",3
493,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I recently downloaded Flo to track my cycle & symptoms. It's a really good concept and has lots to offer IF you subscribe to premium. I don't need the app badly enough to subscribe, so I'm just trying to use the free features, but there's an ad for the premium with almost everything I try to do. I wish I could continue using this because it has great potential, and I need help tracking my reproductive health, but the ads are becoming so annoying that I'll likely delete and find a different app",3
494,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Most of the app has to be paid for, except for the actual tracking feature.... it has a lot of information, that has to be paid for, which I find incredibly unfortunate as I did search for ""free"" tracker apps. the frustration of always having to pay for things like this is wearing. But it's just alright app, pretty much like all the others.",3
495,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Would be five stars but it won't stop advertising the premium version to me. Had to turn off push notifications and all emails because of neverending ads. Every time I open the app I get a non-closable pop up ad for premium. So irritating. Otherwise I love the app, functionality, UI and design. If I didn't love it so much I would have deleted after the first 100 ads for premium.",3
496,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Decent period tracker. I had used the same tracker for a couple years and ended up having g to download a new one when I got rid of my iPhone. Flo seemed like a good new app to try. So far it's been pretty accurate, I've used it for about 6 months . However I wish it had more options for different symptoms to log and wider mood range. my advice would be to work on that.",3
497,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It's great for adding symptoms and everything but there is zero info shared on how to help with anything and you get bombarded with ads to upgrade. There are so many popups that make you think you'll get answers for symptoms etc, and you'll flip through a bunch of slides that tell you nothing only to be told to upgrade it you want to know more. Also can't purchase the premium anyway it always says error when I try to buy the subscription on sale.",3
498,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Good tracking, not great that everything is ""premium content."" I've used this app for a while and through multiple phone changes. It seems to track pretty well as long as you enter in your symptoms. I used to really enjoy the articles and how informational they were, now almost every one is for premium users only. Have been searching for another app with similar resources that I won't have to pay for because I simply can't afford the premium price and it doesn't seem that worth it anyways.",3
499,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Tracks everything I need and helps me to predict my cycle. Update: July 2020 There is a lot of unnecessary social media style stuff that has been added over the past few months or so which is quite annoying to me. Additionally, the 'insights' are almost never related to data that I input. It is as if everyone is just getting blasted with the same unrelated information. I typically just try to ignore it and purely use this to track my cycle.",3
500,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've used this app for 3 years now and between 2 phones. I can say that Flo isn't on the money every single time simply because of my body, but the app is always close. Before the premium update, it was very simple and easy to use, after the premium it's still fairly simple and mostly easy to use. The ads that pop up when I start the app telling me to buy premium when all I wanna do is log a couple things and get out are annoying and the secret chats not having dates on them is equally annoying",3
501,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Been using this app for years now and its been good for the most part. The ads for premium are getting annoying to deal with. Everytime you open the app I swear it has to ask you several times if you want to try out Flo Premium. Just makes me not want to use the app anymore. And I think they could absolutely add more choices for symptoms and such. Really hoping they turn down the ads, its not what it used to be.",3
502,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I switched to Flo from Clue. There are a lot of features I like better with Flo but the non stop notifications make it hard to keep. I have all notifs except period reminders turned off and still get irrelevant notifications at all hours of the day. Turning off the notifications from my phone settings doesn't help because I won't get the reminders I need. I love Flo and would love to see this issue fixed.,3
503,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Flo has become my favorite app for tracking my period. I'm subscribed to the premium but I still wish they have more options on the flow of my period from light, light med, med, and heavy. I also would love to see an decreased sex drive and an increased sex drive option. I also wish there was an increase and decrease appetite option. Basically just more options to track my symptoms. Other than that I like my daily insights, chats, ect.",3
504,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I love the app for it's period tracking abilities and other features like secret chats, the ability to track my water intake, and birth control use BUT I'm so annoyed with the constant ads about upgrading to the premium version. The ads have become so much more persistent since I first downloaded the app years ago. I get that premium is how they make their money but I shouldn't have to click off 5 ads about premium before I'm able to log my daily symptoms. It really digs into the user experience",3
505,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The best you could get until PREMIUM ONLY. Ever since they upgraded to premium options, all the helpful articles that came up everyday are locked and can only be accessed by buying premium subscription. I used to recommend this to people as the best app to get knowledge, accurate tracking. The articles were amazingly helpful. Now cannot get them. I don't know if tracking is still the same and free for predictions or if that's pay for now.",3
506,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Works well and can predict cycle. You can enter your symptoms. When I 1st got it it would occasionally ask you if you wanted premium. Now it's constantly popping up on screen, have to dismiss it every time i click something. Banner always on screen. Will delete if it gets one ounce more aggressive than it already is.",3
507,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Easy to use. Though it records symptoms, there is no way to see if their are correlations with symptoms month to month. The analyze this, is kind of annoying and not super helpful. I would NOT recommended to young people just concerned about health as many articles are not really appropriate (and probably undesirable for religious people as well.) You have the option to hide those articles but it doesn't stop it from similar ""adult"" themes. Ended up deleting for a more health focused app.",3
508,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It's a great period app, but not great when you become pregnant. It calculates how many weeks along you are incorrectly, and this caused a lot of confusion with setting up doctors appointments. I thought I was a week further along than I was because of the app, which caused concern and confusion when I wasn't experiencing morning sickness like I have right at week 6 for my other two pregnancies. It was really because I was still actually 5 weeks.",3
509,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I have been using Flo for many years now and loved it so much but the last couple months it has really taken a change and it is not what it was. I loved the widget and it vanished, and the usability has changed much. Having been both a premium subscriber and a free user, I previously was happy with both options, but now it is not as easy to use and is less useful for me",3
510,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've been using it for almost 3 years now. I used to love it for doing its job and being free without many cons. But the last updates changed things so much that I decided to leave my opinion. The ads certainly bothers me and feels too much, but ok. However, what really has been bothering me lately has been the amount of notifications I keep getting from the app even thought I have already disabled all those I can through the app. And I don't even think the paid version would solve this.",3
511,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Overall it's not a bad app, it doesn't like to load and when it does it takes forever to do so. I have to back out of the app and go back in to see my saved symptoms. I also don't like that it claims it's free on the download and when you search for free tracking apps this one comes up but wants you to subscribe for $49 a year. It tried to charge my card even though I didn't set up a subscription method. Thank goodness it didn't go through.",3
512,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I want to start with I love this app. Its been a pretty excellent tracker for my period, but since March I've been using it for pregnancy. My issue comes to the health insights. I logged on at midnight, as I generally do working nights, to see the newest one. However, im faced with all of them being premium content, even the ones I read just yesterday for free. I get yall need to make money, but maybe a warning? I'll now be switching to a different app for pregnancy.",3
513,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've used this app for a while, and it's great, but like others, I hope all the features return to free with ads being totally acceptable. On another note, are there any features with insights here that I'm missing for women with pelvic diseases and illnesses? I.e. endometriosis and PCOD. That or at least a setting for irregular menstrual cycles? I can't find it Anywhere! And this app is a little confusing for me now that my cycle is irregular.",3
514,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I have been using the app for years and love it. I would rate the app as 5 stars.... Until yesterday. Yesterday my widget completely disappeared. I was using the app, then closed my phone and when I opened my phone again a few minutes later the widget was gone from my screen and my widget options. This is really unfortunate because having the widget reminds me to update things which otherwise doesn't happen regularly due to ADHD.",3
515,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I used to love this app! The basic features work great. I'd give it 5 stars if it weren't always offering/advertising premium features after I've already declined every other time I've used the app! I also used to appreciate that some of the articles/videos were free without premium but now it seems that everything is locked. A lot of that information is readily available for free online already, I wouldn't pay that much for a subscription for it",3
516,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app is helpful for keeping track of your period, symptoms, and when you've had sex. I've been using this app for about 5 years now, and I can say with certainty that the virtual assistant is the most annoying, intrusive, unnecessary feature this app has to offer. I wish there was a feature to turn it off because it is entirely unhelpful. Just let me use the calendar features and shut up.",3
517,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I paid for the full version but it's not really worth it - I absolutely HATE the ""chat"" with the ""health assistant"". It takes forever to find out what it's actually trying to tell you since you have to click a response each time. Please find a better way to communicate this information or just give us charts/graphs/or a questionnaire without all the extra chatting. Also navigation is not very easy to understand since there's so many like widgets you can click on.",3
518,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I have been using this app for several years. It used to be great! Lately they have been implementing changes: longer articles that aren't relevant to my health (rather than the shorter, informative articles chosen specifically for me), no more discussion boards, and they implemented an obnoxious way to tell me new information (they have me ""text"" Flo). I am upset with the changes. Flo used to be awesome!",3
519,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I really loved this app. I've had it for years and it's one of the best period trackers. But they added a subscription which is understandable. But for someone who doesn't want all the extra coaching and extras like me, the cost doesn't seem worth it. I miss when the app was more simple, though I am glad it's expanded because there are people who need the coaching and answers to their questions.",3
520,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"(Hi Support Team, please see the last sentence of my review, which addresses the need to generate revenue.) A good app that used to be much better. You now need to pay for a subscription to use anything besides the most basic tracking features... whose accuracy is affected because you can't use the other features. I'd be happy to have more advertisements in the app rather than pay for a subscription. I hope they can make this an option.",3
521,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I like that it gives me charts of my cycles and is able to relatively accurately predict my cycle. The more you use it, the better it gets at predicting. So, don't give up on your second or third month! It also helps me track other things, like sex, cervical mucus, etc. It also has helpful articles that are picked for your particular symptoms or cycle. **Update: Almost everything has turned into premium content. It is a real shame. It's just good for period tracking, now.",3
522,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The app isn't horrible, but not too great. It helps me keep track of my period and my cycle, plus it gives me decent tips. However, it pushes premium too much.

Do better and stop scamming women.",3

Sometimes I feel just fine then look at the bad forecast about what I might experience and unintentionally, mentally expect and attract it. The negative notifications popping up just aren't needed so had to turn off notifications for this app. Then, the assistant trying to chat every single time I open the app is annoying.",3
524,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I used to love this App. It offered many useful articles let alone period tracking and pregnancy tracking. However, the excessive requests to go premium were annoying but something I was able to overlook while getting useful information.

I cant access anything in the app without saying i dont want to upgrade every single time i open it, or a new page. I just want to track my cycle and this works for that. I wont be upgrading though, because youve begged for money so aggressively that i cant even use the app without getting annoyed.",3
526,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I just use this to track my cycle but at every click im bombarded with ads for the premium subscription. It's worse than it used to be. And just to log in you have to watch a long tutorial about what premium does when logging in for the first time on a device.

But I missed how specific the app was and all the resources offered in comparison to other tracker apps so I came back. The tracker itself is still good. The daily insights are clogged with paywalls and premium has pop-up ads for itself. It's frustrating for non-premium users who used to have access to a lot of the premium benefits, most of which were genuinely helpful.",3
531,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,The app is a decent period tracker but is an excellent women's health app when using premium (I am very satisfied with my free trial thus far) but the notifications are not functional. I added an alarm for non-contraceptive medication and it has never shown up. In the same tab I also have snoozed other notifications like for secret chats yet every day they are reactivated and show up in my notification bar. Once this bug is fixed I think there's no reason this app can't be 5 stars.,3

Bummer 😔",3
535,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,It's good at helping me track my periods but you have to pay to do anything else in the app. Overall it's a good app but the memberships are expensive you only have two options 7.99 or 39.99 which is way too expensive to do some quizzes and answer questions. There's no point in having to pay for stuff you probably won't use it's just a way for them to make extra money.,3

There's very little given to users who don't have it, and it's not really that great for you to have to pay to learn about your body. The premium pop ups while talking with the Flo bot are annoying. If I didnt want to pay for premium a hour ago, I don't now. The app constantly thrusting it in my face annoys the heck out of me.

562,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The app works fine to track your period, but the ads for Premium have become overwhelming in recent months. They also provide a ton of teaser content to try to get you to buy Premium, which feels like you are being tricked. I liked the app a lot before they started trying to sell Premium so hard core. Now I only use it because it has all my data and I don't want to start over with a different one.",3
563,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I used to recommend this to everyone. Have used this for a long time. Then all of the sudden you get contant ad pushing to get premiem. Constant. I'd be okay with the little ad on the side or somewhere on the app. But its a popup that you have to press out of and that just annoys the hell out of me. I also dont like the little chat (click bait)that comes up to talk to you about your symptoms . I never press on it because it ALWAYS ends up wanting premiem to finish what its saying.,3
564,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've used this app for years, and it was exactly what I needed. Now that they're pushing premium content, I'm generally disappointed that I'm constantly trying to get notifications off my app, or I click on ""free content"" and it's actually paid content after the title page. I just want to track my cycle and symptoms!",3
565,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I used to have a 5 star rating on the app but the last few years (unless you want to pay for it) is just very basic and makes me angry with not having seeming anything for free. I will say if you want to buy it I recommend around black Friday or Christmas(maybe other times I'm not sure). They run deals then for a good price. Not necessarily for just tracking your period, But for fertility or trying to figure out your cycle I think it's worth it. Without paying its not great.",3
566,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I really like the app because it helps me keep track of my period and gives me reminders when I'm going to start, but I'm annoyed with all the extra notifications I get about fitness or mental health or whatever else. I just want to know when my period is going to start. But if I turn off all notifications I won't get the ""Your cycle will start in a few days"" reminder - the only notification I want. Stop with all the extra nonsense.",3
567,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I have been using this app for a couple years now. I started without the premium. The tracking was pretty spot on. Then I decided to pay for premium. I have had to switch phones a couple times and each time I did I re downloaded this app and logged in as usual and would notice it never backed up any data I put in like periods and pregnancy. I noticed all it does is load up I paid for premium. I would have to manually input all info. Not enough room for all issues. Fix data backup it dont save!,3
568,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I started using Flo to just track my cycle and symptoms. Eventually, I found its options limited for symptoms and wish there was a way to add a custom one. I opted into premium when trying to conceive and during my pregnancy, but I canceled afterward. Since trying to use it again, I find it very annoying with the number of times it will advertise the premium subscription. Most of the articles or the information it offers is locked to premium members, so it's less beneficial to me these days.",3
569,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Like many others, I've been using flo for years and recent updates have been not great. The update made information that we had access to before for free, a paid premium feature. The problem that has been bothering me the most though, is the birth control reminder. I have been using this app to also remind me to take my birth control for nearly a year now and the recent updates have made it so I no longer receive them no matter how much I reset it. This app is quickly losing it's appeal to me.",3
570,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app is great and accurate, however it does lack a feature that I would use. In households with more than one girl, an account switch button would be amazing. Other similar apps have that feature. I know because I had to download a diff app for my young daughter to use just to keep track of start and stop trends. Thank you.",3
571,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I do like that it keeps track of so many things and tracks my period and pregnancy process. However, I prefer how it used to be a couple years ago when I first downloaded it, before it was constantly nagging me to pay to upgrade. It used to give helpful advice and tips for free. Now it just tempts me with ""daily insights"" and tells me to upgrade and pay to view any of it.",3
572,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Wonderful tracker. Notifications are annoying though. Have to keep them on because it alerts when you're almost bleeding. When im not bleeding, it sends me useless Notifications about training regimens and mental health. Tried to turn Notifications off but they still send. Just track my period. I don't need any of the extra BS.",3
573,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Used to be good, but all the suggested reading (that you have to have a paid subscription to even look at) takes up half the screen now and I'm super not interested in having articles about birth control and masturbation advertised at me. I just want a simple app to track my cycle, all the extra stuff is annoying.",3
574,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Very helpful for day to day use with interesting and informative insights. However, the lower rating is because of more recent changes that promote the premium version so aggressively that it has actually made it frustrating to use. Before the aggressive promotion, it was an excellent app. Now, I am so annoyed that I am switching apps.",3
575,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I LOVED this app in the beginning of 2019 when I was trying to track ovulation and get pregnant but now they've changed it so much and are so pushy about wanting you to subscribe to premium to view most of their stuff. Even though there isn't much free content available like there used to be, I wish there was an option to hide all the premium clickbait.",3
576,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I love this app. Usually fantastic at tracking my cycle accurately, but there is one major downside. In the insights to your cycle, unless you have a premium membership, you can't get to any of the actually useful information. I've been using this app for at least 2 years and this need for ""Flo Premium"" has made it to where I'm less likely to use the app for anything more than period tracking.",3
577,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"mine varies so i couldn't pick how many days it comes when it tells me to insert about how often it comes. but it doesn't have the option ""it varies"". that option would make it easier for every female that has trouble trying to put down how often their time comes some has every 28 days or some come 45 or a little more or they skipped. would love to see a ""skipped month"" option. that would really help a lot.",3
578,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,The app is ok and helpful but the chat doesn't seem all that great or relevant. The symptom log can also use some change. I also wish it would track severity of cramps so I can keep in mind what to prepare for. Accidentally purchased yesr subscription but might end it after the year since it doesn't appear to be worth the money.,3
579,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I changed my review to 3 stars because the most recent update got rid of the weight, water, sleep, and notes section of every day. I really liked being able to track everything, however I am not sure why these things were removed. Edit: I see where these things are tracked, but I do not see where to enter thar information. Why is it being tracked if I can't enter the information?",3
580,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Of all the apps I've used, this one is still on my phone and I haven't deleted it yet despite me hating the premium ad but no other ads pop up so I'm keeping it. It dosen't track well with irregular/late cycles but I make it work by adding notes about how long between cylces. Can you add 2 features that allows me to save the number of days I'm late and walking as a physical activity parameter? I think if you added these extra parameters you might get more people who might consider your app!",3
581,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I would like to be able to customize the mood options to my lifestyle. I currently only use 2-3 in the app on a regular basis, but it could be beneficial to choose which show up on a daily report, or at least be able to rename them. For example, I would rather use grumpy than irritated most days. Just a thought.",3
582,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Edit: what happened to the Flo widget for Android? Works pretty well and I like the widget available for android. Although, the new-er ads are annoying. I also don't like the notifications. I turned them off but now I won't receive notifications about when my period is about to start, which are the only notifications I care about. I don't want the ""Day 12: your breasts may feel tender"" notifications.",3
583,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"They're stingy now 😕 I used to looooove using this app. It has been a life changer. But now you have to pay for everything. Like, you can log your symptoms and period but you can't look at the advice or anything helpful for long before it blacks it out and makes you buy it. There are also tons of ads. It's sad! Women should be more kind to women! Not stingy!",3
584,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It's a good app, incredibly accurate. However, the tips and tricks, or any health insight you have to be a premium member to see, if you aren't, they're basically ads at the bottom of the screen. You can't even see like one or two a day, it's all or nothing, which is infuriating",3
585,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This used to be my go-to period tracker app. The predictions are helpful and it's very streamlined and easy-to-use! BUT, in the past year or so, the ads for the paid version have gotten more and more frequent and annoying, to the point that I'm switching to a different app.",3
586,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Many of my previous points still stand but now you need to pay for everything even simple tips. It's always asking if you want to upgrade or have a free trial and at the home page at the bottom there's even an option. It's too much. Previous review: Love this app! So many options to log your symptoms (as I find other apps lack a list of symptoms such as perineum pain, etc.). Easy to use though it still doesn't have my 'average' cycle etc. Despite having it for years. Nevertheless a great app!",3
587,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Been using this app for years. Convenient for tracking periods, ovulation, etc. I rely on it quite a bit but I hate that you have to pay to use other aspects of the app like its understandable but kind of annoying. Would rather just have a limited version thats completely free instead of getting asked to pay all the time.",3
588,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Recent update is not great. Even with the paid version, there's duplicated info cards and it won't show the next days tips/info. I used to see videos and interviews from medical professionals and now they're never there? Not sure if that's a bug or it was purposefully removed. *Precious review: Paid version is very helpful for me. Lots of info without feeling intrusive. Wish the advice during the pregnancy phase mentioned or had options for non-USA users.",3
589,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It is an extremely good app. I've personally had this app years probably since it was first developed. And due to having it for so long I ended up gaining the premium for free. Unfortunately I broke my phone and tried to log in but it wouldn't let me so I ended up having to make a new one. Now Ive not got a premium account I've now realised how frustrating it is. cause you need premium to be able to get the full info on specific things, insights ect you need it to even run the app efficiently...",3
590,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app is good, but it's getting more and more intrusive with asking me to upgrade to Premium. I won't do it and I don't know how many times I have to reject. Especially since I get offers by email too, and a ton of notifications. I don't wanna lose my data, but otherwise I would've quit it for another app. Appreciate your loyal users and stop spamming them!",3
591,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I'm pretty happy with the app for tracking my period, however, what bothers me about it is that fact once you put down that your pregnant, there isn't an icon to select if you have suffered from a miscarriage, you have to delete it like it never happened. I myself had an ectopic pregnancy and the only way I can put it on the app is through my notes which doesn't affect the apps prediction. I think this should be the next update for Flo as these situations happen often.",3
592,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I use this app as a tracker, that's it. It's not very ""pro-women"". Why should I have to pay to understand things about my body? Just like how it's not right for women to have to pay for period products. Not only that, but it's just shoved in your face every turn you take, ""buy premium!!"" It's quite annoying. And for advice that could be wrong, maybe it shouldn't be something you have to pay for.",3
593,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Good app for tracking period! The only problem is secret chats. For the first year I had this app everything was fine with secret chats. I could talk and say anything without getting any suspensions, and NOW every time I chat ANYTHING I get a suspension! Please fix this. It's been over a month this has been happening. I also emailed your support team about this and they never fixed/got back to me. I want to be able to ask questions, but I can't. PLEASE FIX!!!!!!",3
594,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I love this apps and i am premium user. Right now Flo kind of annoy me bcuz they kept suggesting me to take pregnancy test again and again (i did twice alrdy) eventho i never key in having sex in the month. They also said that i might be pregnant and it is my early pregnancy so the hormone has not kickin yet. I install this app just to monitor my menstrual. Im not trying to get pregnant or anything. Hope u guys can fix this.,3
595,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Solid app, nothing special in my opinion. Starting to get annoyed. Yes, my period may be late at times, based on previous ""chats"" it should be logged that there isn't a chance of pregnancy. Ask once, don't keep suggesting the same conversations (why your period may be late) and questions ""are you pregnant?"" It gets annoying. Generally it's a good feature, but not if you're more than a few days late and have been suggested it every 2nd day.",3
596,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It's fine for tracking, but the amount of options that are hidden as premium content is honestly insane. I love the idea of being able to get further information that I can trust, particularly when it notes irregularities in my cycle. I don't love it as much if I have to pay a subscription.",3
597,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app is great for tracking your period, but everything requires payment. I am a 16 year old girl trying to keep track of things and still discover her body, since when did we have to pay for having our periods. If this was a man's app I guarantee you everything would still be free. I am not trying to be rude. I am just saying that we should get more access to what the app provides instead of having to pay for everything.",3
598,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"So far the app has been fine, I can think of two improvements that would make this review 5 stars: 1. Please stop with all the extra fluff of 'insights' and articles and adverts for the premium version. If I wanted it, I would get it. The extra noise created in the app from all this extra content that I can't access and don't want to access makes me definitely not want to get the premium version. 2. If there was an option to add more personalized symptoms, emotions and other options to track!!",3
599,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've been using this for years, have already told the developers that I can't sync between different devices and how inconvenient that is. Until now, the apps still won't sync. It's been what? 5 years? You have to login and out just so it would sync, and that is ridiculous. ANOTHER issue I'm now having is notifications are blocked on this app. I've done everything to fix it on my android, but nothing. Many say it's the app that's at fault.",3
600,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,App was good before.. since the last update I've realised that I'm now getting fewer daily insights and the daily insights on mood ect based on the cycle day has disappeared 😥...this was really important for me,3
601,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Nice app,3
602,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,u haveto pay for things like what the heck I'm not rich,3
603,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I've loved using Flo. It's been more than 3 years but because of it's anonymous mode I'm unable to restore my data and I'm switching apps now 🙄😒 Also when I log my periods in this app if I log in at 11:00 pm it shows that I've had my periods for the whole day and think its weird because it just started at the end of the day and not from morning.. Also after the latest update this app has become more sex related..?? And not to forget the irritating popups abt premium subscriptions 😤,3
604,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,the subscription is stupid but the app itself is great,3
605,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I think it's okay but for the fact that some a students and won't be able to subscribe,3
606,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Good,3

However, I do not like how many nearly pornographic photos there are for the different articles.

I was unable to access my premium (paid) account for nearly a month after multiple attempts to reach customer support through every possible channel.

Please I want all my information to be restored back on the app. I am pregnant and the articles there has been helping me. Please treat as urgent . Thanks,3

663,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I love this app it's just the best,3
664,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"its a good app,,,",3
665,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've seen that in previous version of the app, you could manually change your day of ovulation, but I can't do it now :(",3
666,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,We need to be able to move this app to external storage of our phone. Docked one star for that. Other then that I love this app,3
667,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The partner experience is pretty limited, with no access to the calendar of future possible period dates.",3
668,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Many of my previous points still stand but now you need to pay for everything even simple tips. It's always asking if you want to upgrade or have a free trial and at the home page at the bottom there's even an option. It's too much. Previous review: Love this app! So many options to log your symptoms (as I find other apps lack a list of symptoms such as perineum pain, etc.). Easy to use though it still doesn't have my 'average' cycle etc. Despite having it for years. Nevertheless a great app!",3
669,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It used to have a lot more for free, then accidentally signed up for more, then cancelled and basically nothing is free but the forums and logging your period and ovulation. Great app, if you pay, sucks otherwise to take everything away. If you have a miscarriage, it doesn't understand and will badger you about adding your period and give tips during your healing period. They didn't do well preparing for that, even though it's such a common thing.",3
670,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app is so nice that I have been using it for 5yrs now but it pains me that after changing to a new phone, I downloaded the app and used the same email but I couldn't access my data,,, this is not the first time I changed my phone, I changed it for the first time in 2021, the data automatically came in, but now I can't get it back, I really need the data back please do something about it",3
671,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Flo was working perfectly but ever since the update, everything I've been tracking disappeared and I couldn't log into my account. I've been trying and it leads me to some empty black screen.",3
672,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,True to the word,3
673,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It's a really good app, just quite expensive",3
674,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Still my go to tracking app. The interface is user friendly and simple enough to understand. However, I initially got this app BEFORE the subscription update. It was amazing then. Great track. Helpful info. Mostly positive community. The paywall, in my opinion, really hurt the overall usefulness of the app. I feel like 90% of the information available is now locked behind that wall. And I just don't know how much of the information is worth the cost.",3
675,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,quite amazing,3
676,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app would be awesome, however there are one too many pop ups advertising the premium version, and even the notifications you receive lead only to a paywall.",3
677,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I remember being able to decide which categories I saw but now everything is there and I can't edit or rearrange it. I'd prefer to have symptoms at the top, not sex. Also there is no option to mark ovulation pain. It's not the same as cramps or abdominal pain.",3
678,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It's a good app, but you have to pay! I would like to understand my own body without having to pay for it. I know they dont mean it this way, but it feels like a scam.",3
679,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Request to commit via fingerprint then to a pay wall made me feel uncomfortable,3
680,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,fine,3
681,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It's great for keeping up with my cycle. But attempting to offer health information about my cycle then sending me to a screen that tried to get me subscribed is annoying. I understand everything can't be free, but stop the pop-ups or offer us an option to disable them.",3
682,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It's pretty good but sometimes inacurrate, maybe it's just me tho. Many features are premium but for the essential tracking of your flow, it's alright.",3
683,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app is great for tracking your period, but everything requires payment. I am a 16 year old girl trying to keep track of things and still discover her body, since when did we have to pay for having our periods. If this was a man's app I guarantee you everything would still be free. I am not trying to be rude. I am just saying that we should get more access to what the app provides instead of having to pay for everything.",3
684,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Just so amazing,3
685,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It is a good app so far, looking forward to see more",3
686,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Very good and accurate,3
687,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I feel like it's not as good as it used to be and it's not really worth the money at that point? I also feel like the old flo made more things available for free which is a good idea if you want people to pay for more content imo.. anyway great for tracking ur cycle but not really worth the money for the premium version,3
688,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Nice app I wish I have extra money to use the service,3
689,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Can't log into the app,3
690,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"downloaded this for the partners, you get practically 0 features for free",3
691,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Very user friendly for tracking your period and has a lot of good info. The main thing I don't like is there needs to be an option for people who are not sexually active. I get tired of it accusing me of not being in the mood and giving me fertility tips. Also, the upsell for the subscription is very annoying. Every time I do anything in the app it tries to get me to subscribe. Otherwise a good app.",3
692,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Not bad,3
693,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Beautiful,3
694,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The app is fairly accurate and has a bunch of useful information, but that is behind a paywall. EVERYTHING is paid and it is sooo annoying. anywhere you click it tell you you gotta pay. If your users don't ant tonpay just remove all the features that are payed. Dont leae them to bloat the app and be annoying to the point it makes them wanna delete the app.",3
695,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,It's a great idea 💡,3
696,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,It has really helped me tracking my circle,3
697,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Glad they have an option for me as a partner to have access to her Flo without me having to log in. Given their poor privacy record this is a step in the right direction.,3
698,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Not the best but ok,3
699,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Why must everyone using the app unlock premium for some information? I'm using for just to continue telling dates. Because sometimes i need a something as reminder.,3
700,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Awesome but the monthly subscription is much,3
701,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,should be free,3
702,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It's good, but there are lots of options and half of it I can't access it because it's nor free.",3
703,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I've been using it recently and I extremely hate that almost everything (articles the chat and others) needs for you too pay but it can be a good app to notify you of your period but ig you just can't access most of the stuff including the educational stuff that most of us need..,3
704,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I would give this 5 stars but the annoying subscription reminders.,3
705,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Useful app but the ""assistant"" is the most annoying, useless, waste of money AI I've ever dealt with. The pop ups are more like a punishment than a feature. It can never tell you anything more useful than you can look up on the internet. The app itself would get 4 stars but the ""assistant"" makes the use of the app so much less enjoyable. Also, the toxic positivity jesus talk (trust in the savior and you'll get pregnant!) in the forums is super gross and there's no way to filter it out.",3
706,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This is a great app, but unfortunately now you can do very little without paying for premium. You used to get the extra insights for free (or at least a decent amount of them) and now you get nothing. Think it's a shame that they have reduced the amount you get over the years.",3
707,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"While this is a good app for tracking your cycle, it is extremely impractical for anytime you download the app on another device for it to do a whole new questionnaire on your cycle without giving you to simply log in with the previous information already on an established account.",3
708,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Just love the app,3
709,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Nice app,3
710,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Nice,3
711,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Could be a great app, I signed up for the trial period and am looking to cancel. I still have 9 days to cancel. No one responded to my request yet. Please help me cancel before I get charged for the app.",3
712,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I get annoyed at how many notifications I get! Just stop already! I do not want to know what might happen on the 21st day of my cycle! I just want to know when my period started! I have to get some pills for my period on the 16th day of my cycle but it can't help me with that because it doesn't have costumizabil pill reminders (but that doesn't bother me as much since it is a bit much to ask). Overall it's a somewhat good app if you are interested in all the fun facts about feminine hygiene.,3
713,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Solid app, nothing special in my opinion. Starting to get annoyed. Yes, my period may be late at times, based on previous ""chats"" it should be logged that there isn't a chance of pregnancy. Ask once, don't keep suggesting the same conversations (why your period may be late) and questions ""are you pregnant?"" It gets annoying. Generally it's a good feature, but not if you're more than a few days late and have been suggested it every 2nd day.",3
714,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,It's a great app. You get access to menstrual health and education and premium Flo is now free in my country Zimbabwe,3
715,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Very useful,3
716,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Wanted to talk and ask questions. Can't do it here,3
717,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,It's helpful to know your fertile window,3
718,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I have just started let us see how it goes,3
719,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The app is okay, but really, it only tells you when ovulation is and when your next period is. There's also stuff you can ask about anything you want to know about your hygiene and body, which is sometimes helpful, but you have to search what exactly you're looking for for the LONGEST time. Other than that, you need a premium to get into proper detail about anything.",3
720,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,it's a really good app,3
721,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,It's a very good app! But for teens it shouldn't cost much and I understand that the company needs money but do they need it so much that most of the things need a subscription?!,3
722,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Having problems logging in on new device,3
723,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I used it before the 2 updates back? I don't remember. Then i update, but why did you remove the darjer theme? If you can't have dark mode, at least give some darker theme please",3
724,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I found Flo to be brilliant in helping track my cycle. My wife and I went through ivf to become pregnant and the tracking truly supported this. However, once transfered to the pregnancy section, I wanted to use the 'partner' service but felt I couldn't. This is because it related to 'dad' and 'he' and had no alternative setting for a same sex couple or even a woman (in or out of the lgbt community) who had become pregnant through donor sperm.",3
725,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app is good, but it's getting more and more intrusive with asking me to upgrade to Premium. I won't do it and I don't know how many times I have to reject. Especially since I get offers by email too, and a ton of notifications. I don't wanna lose my data, but otherwise I would've quit it for another app. Appreciate your loyal users and stop spamming them!",3
726,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Wish didn't charge but keeps up with my cycle,3
727,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Nice,3
728,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Great app,3
729,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It is an extremely good app. I've personally had this app years probably since it was first developed. And due to having it for so long I ended up gaining the premium for free. Unfortunately I broke my phone and tried to log in but it wouldn't let me so I ended up having to make a new one. Now Ive not got a premium account I've now realised how frustrating it is. cause you need premium to be able to get the full info on specific things, insights ect you need it to even run the app efficiently...",3
730,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It does what it is meant to do, but everything else you need to pay for like the lessons which would have been very helpful and informative, I find that a little annoying. Otherwise good app.",3
731,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Stopped supporting being a widget I want my widget back! I have One UI z flip 5 Help!!,3
732,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It's pretty accurate, I'm 15 and I just use it for tracking my period but it can be used for planning pregnancies as well. I'd say the app is really good if you're using it for a sol purpose of managing your periods.",3
733,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Honestly it's really disappointing to see that you can get a one week free trial only AFTER filling in the questionnaire to personalize your use of the app, but then it costs from $6-$14 a month.. Why not just put a price on the app itself and give us a half decent period-tracker-and-info-only version? Maybe it's just menstrual moodswings making me kind of irrationally angry about this, but I'LL NEVER KNOW NOW WILL I!!? I am gonna go have ice cream for breakfast now, thaaaanks..",3
734,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Recent update is not great. Even with the paid version, there's duplicated info cards and it won't show the next days tips/info. I used to see videos and interviews from medical professionals and now they're never there? Not sure if that's a bug or it was purposefully removed. *Precious review: Paid version is very helpful for me. Lots of info without feeling intrusive. Wish the advice during the pregnancy phase mentioned or had options for non-USA users.",3
735,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Not the best because a lot of stuff is locked behind money not every one has all that money,3
736,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,So many ads,3
737,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Helpful,3
738,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Good,3
739,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I was trying to sync my data from my old phone with my email but it didn't bring anything over. I had a pregnancy and I couldn't backdate my pregnancy which I would like to be able to do. So I can properly keep track of things.,3
740,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It's ok, almost accurate sometimes",3
741,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,7 days free trial only. then you need subscription. I did not use it,3
742,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I don't like that you have to pay for it because people could really need the information and can't pay for it but other then that the app is rlly good,3
743,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,ينفع اغير اللغه للعربيه؟,3
744,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Meh,3
745,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app is great for me. This helps me to prepare for my period, ovulation etc. However I gave it 3 stars because before the age requirement was 13+ but now you have to be 16+ wichis annoying. So this app is now pointless to me for the next 3 years of my life",3
746,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Overall, the app is fine. Flo does what it is supposed to do. However, it seems almost impossible to do the most simple of things without some in-app pop-up trying to get you to buy premium access. The ""health assistant"" pops up every time you go to a new screen, and there are almost always 2 premium pop-ups with difficult to find exit buttons. I would just like to be able to track a period without all the extra effort.",3
747,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Great app, honestly. But can you guys cool it a bit on the q&a's and the constant sex topics? I want to know how my body works and when I get what and why. Its interesting to get something about sex every now and then but I see it every. day. And I also don't need to get a Q&A titled: your period might be late! Wanna check why? ON the day I MIGHT get my period. I have a range of at least 4 days. Calm down. Its stressful and annoying.",3
748,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Originally, I was able to chat and get feedback. I damaged my cellular device and got a new one, and when I logged back in, I lost that feature, and they kept asking me to pay. I still use the calendar to assist with tracking my cycle for ovulation and period dates, though. A good app.",3
749,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Nice app,3
750,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,accurate,3
751,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I've used this app on and off for years. But I have just deleted it as the constant pushing of paid for subscription content is just annoying!,3
752,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Honestly speaking previous version of this app was better than the new one, they have so much stuff there also they ask about period flow aswell which was really helpful to track the cycle I wish they add that feature again",3
753,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I love this app it's educational and makes you understand better about conceiving.,3
754,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I'm pretty happy with the app for tracking my period, however, what bothers me about it is that fact once you put down that your pregnant, there isn't an icon to select if you have suffered from a miscarriage, you have to delete it like it never happened. I myself had an ectopic pregnancy and the only way I can put it on the app is through my notes which doesn't affect the apps prediction. I think this should be the next update for Flo as these situations happen often.",3
755,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Not great for pregnancy tracking. As soon as it hit week 40 gestational age, the app automatically and irreversibly switched back to period tracking mode. So not cool. Please consult some actual users or at least do some basic research.",3
756,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Good app but I actually don't want notifications telling me that might have headaches or pimples today...,3
757,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Decent app, I use to like it a lot before THEY TOOK AWAY ALL THE DARK APPEARANCE SETTINGS!!!! They brought some back... THEN TOOK THEM AWAY AGAIN!!!!! Now whenever I open the app my eyeballs are scalded with blinding light. Please give us a dark mode. It doesn't have to be pretty, just blessedly dim. This app has been very helpful to me and I have years of history on it, but I'm strongly considering looking for an alternative that doesn't hurt my eyes.",3
758,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,After getting the premuim I dont see any more suggestions for the cool and helfull articles I use to see and couldn't read without premuim.,3
759,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Very nice,3
760,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,it's a great app but they should stop making eveything premium,3
761,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Does not easily let you cancel your subscription. Unable to cancel through the app itself. Seems like a way to take your money by making it hard to cancel your subscription!,3
762,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,the app is helpful but I hate how i have to be charged to go back and look at old symptoms or I'm limited to look at just about anything now. The app isnt as good as it was. I'm disappointed. There was a time I would have put 5 stars. I don't anymore. All you want to do is take my money.,3
763,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I'm reviewing this as a man who is partnered up, so I don't have the full experience of the app. It's appreciated being able to see my wife's predicted symptoms and get more info, plus the articles and such can be helpful for those who need them. However, the time-based items (such as quizzes) are an INCREDIBLE hindrance, making them occasionally nigh unusable if you are a slower reader. There is also a surprising lack of information shared with me regarding my wife's cycle and body.",3
764,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Its good does what its meant to. I like that there are topics that you can talk about. I dont like the fact that it tries to force me to pay for premium like everytime. Its soo annoying that I was starting to look at other apps to replace this one. Please stop shoving it in my face I aint buying it cut your losses,3
765,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Help needed! Partner addition isn't allowing us to pair. It sends my partner a link and code but no where to actually put in the code. What are we doing wrong!?,3
766,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,The app is good,3
767,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Dislike the fact that you have to pay money to figure out what's wrong with your body,3
768,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app has been helpful to me, Now I can track my period, ovulation and even understand what goes on in my body now.. it's a goal goal for me",3
769,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Loved this app until it became to where nothing is free except logging your period.,3
770,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It's fine for tracking, but the amount of options that are hidden as premium content is honestly insane. I love the idea of being able to get further information that I can trust, particularly when it notes irregularities in my cycle. I don't love it as much if I have to pay a subscription.",3
771,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Still learning,3
772,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,The app is incredible I've been using it since I was 16 an with an irregular cycle it's been super helpful even through having my 3 kids. The reason I've only given it 3 stars is because it started off completely free which was great then it brought in the exclusive pay parts was annoying because things I had access too I no longer did. And now it's pay only. I went from using the app to needing a phone upgrade and not being able to use it because I had to pay it's disappointing honestly.,3
773,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,It's okay for a period tracker but it's always pushing the premium option not every one can afford in your face.,3
774,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,A great app for understanding your cycle. You obviously get locked out from the most useful stuff as a non paying member. But it's still useful. The sad part is that it's pop-up hell if you don't show the money.,3
775,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Great 👍,3
776,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Sometimes it's not accurate,3
777,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It's a good app but I feel like the paid content is too much like it pops up all the time it's a bit annoying. I feel like I had access to more information on my cycle when I first started using the app a few years ago, now everything is paid content which, for some basic things, it's a shame.",3
778,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Not for me but informative. I only used the app to see when I was ovulating cause it's free. This morning, I woke up to a yearly charge that I don't remember agreeing too but I probably accepted the 30-day free trial. Like I said it's a good app but for me not worth that money nor do i use it like that. If u need help body wise this is for u. Covers masterbation, identify ur body discharge, follows pregnancy etc. My money is needed for therapy ✨️ but again this is a great app for others.",3
779,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"My only problem in this app is, I can't even do my self-assessment like talking to the bot about my period problems, because it always tells me to try the premium version, and I don't want to because I have no money to pay for it and even it says ""try it for free"" it's still not working! and when I tried to restart the app, it's still there, it's still asking me to try the premium version. It pisses me off, however this app can actually help me to know if my period will come soon.",3
780,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Is a nice, helpful app but I'm limited to ""today"" and ""insight"" only, I don't see the discovery, the chats and posts again. It's making the app boring for me because I don't get to see new stuffs again and my settings are not working please, I go to settings, try to customize it but it doesn't. I wanted to turn the ""drink water"" reminder on but it's not activating rather deactivating. Please what should I do, I couldn't upgrade to premium because I don't have debit card too",3
781,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Good app but doesn't seem to recalculate cycle predictions based on ovulation test results, which makes it seem pointless to have it as an option to log.",3
782,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,You made it so you have to pay for basically everything now. Way to be on the women's health side.,3
783,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,the old version did not request payments 🙄,3
784,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The app is good. In this case, I find the gender neutral language insulting",3
785,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It's ok the app to use it as a tracker and for symptoms, without subscription. But so sad that it's only anual payment, this way I'll never subscribe.",3
786,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,This application is very good,3
787,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,My notifications are not working.,3
788,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I have good experience,3
789,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"i've been checking my phone settings and everything but i still don't understand. my notification function stopped since idk when and i can't fix it. it always says it's blocked even though i tried everything. i don't know if it's the phone or the app, but eitherways, it's getting annoying. i hope it can be fixed soon.",3
790,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"So far the app has been fine, I can think of two improvements that would make this review 5 stars: 1. Please stop with all the extra fluff of 'insights' and articles and adverts for the premium version. If I wanted it, I would get it. The extra noise created in the app from all this extra content that I can't access and don't want to access makes me definitely not want to get the premium version. 2. If there was an option to add more personalized symptoms, emotions and other options to track!!",3
791,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,the app is very good but it should have mpesa as payment mode,3
792,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Previously 5 stars. Reduced it coz no dark mode and the dark skin on the main page was removed. Not a fan,3
793,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Great app for tracking your period and mentrual symptoms, I've had no problem with that. I am kinda shocked at how heteronormative all the articles are though. People with periods don't just have sex with men - come on it's 2023. I was okay with it to a point but when I saw the 'share with partner ' bit and it said 'he'll know...' come on - it's silly and so easy to change the language used",3
794,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I was charged for the app after I uninstalled it over a year ago. I no longer needed it. I am very upset and hopeful for a refund.,3
795,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've been using this for years, have already told the developers that I can't sync between different devices and how inconvenient that is. Until now, the apps still won't sync. It's been what? 5 years? You have to login and out just so it would sync, and that is ridiculous. ANOTHER issue I'm now having is notifications are blocked on this app. I've done everything to fix it on my android, but nothing. Many say it's the app that's at fault.",3

But I really wish there was a way to add different types of physical activity to this app because I don't do any of the cliche ones. I snowboard. I swim. Callisthenics etc. I also wish there was a way to note if you had to take emergency contraceptives aside from OCs. The app premium isn't that expensive per year too, which I like.",4
801,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It's an overall great app to help young confused teens understand the concepts of growing up. I love how friendly everyone is to each other and how helpful people are. The only thing I find disappointing is that it doesn't let you find out facts about your emotions, period, and just growing up until you set up the trial. I really wish it was free. But until then I'm completely fine with just looking at the comments for answers. It's so good to know when Im going to start. It's so scaryaccurate.",4
802,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Flo is very helpful at predicting and tracking your period dates, and ovulation dates if you're looking for them. It provides a few helpful tips about how to take care of yourself and what is good or bad for your health. One thing that gets annoying after it happens every time is the pop-ups. There are few ads, I mean more about the recommended articles, or actions. I try to input my daily symptoms and it's telling everything else. I was just trying to input info...",4
803,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It gets the job done with tracking what I need. I think it's misleading to keep having certain features pop up, only for me to find out they're stuck behind a paywall. I completely understand that the app needs to make money to keep running, I'm just not interested in any of the premium features. Running an ad here & there throughout the app is something I wouldn't mind. Other than that, I enjoy using it everyday.",4
804,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Great app, annoying notifications. I've been using Flo for years and it's been great. Pretty accurate, you can log a lot of stuff, gives you good information about your cycle as a whole. The UI is easy to navigate and tells you what you need to know at a glance. The reason I uninstalled is because it CONSTANTLY bombards you with notifications to switch to Flo Premium for a monthly fee. The only way to turn those off is to disable notifs from the whole app, which includes ""period starts soon""...",4
805,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Very good app to keep track of periods, and gives a lot of good health tips with the insight tab. The only flaw is the sync between other devices. It will not transfer data from one device to another unless you log out and log back into your account if both accounts are logged in. If you put in data in one device, it will not transfer over to the other. Overall, it is still a good app.",4
806,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This is a great, easy-to-use app for tracking your period and symptoms. The biggest thing I wish they would do is to add a feature where we can see patterns in our symptoms (for example, seeing where in our cycles we tend to experience mood swings, or digestive issues, etc). It's somewhat frustrating to log this info every day but not see any analysis of it (supposedly the analysis is happening behind the scenes to improve the period prediction).",4
807,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The app has accurate predictions, and there are some free articles with interesting information. However, a drawback of the app is that it doesn't use trans-inclusive language. Everything is centered around ciswomen. The phrase ""girls and women"" is thrown around a LOT, making the app uncomfortable to use for transmen and transnonbinary people who experience menstrual cycles. I hope that this is rectified in the future, but in the meantime, I am seeking other options for tracking my period.",4
808,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,The period tracking is usually pretty accurate. I love the daily log feature so I can record my own insights. I like the recent addition of more choices for emotions. What I don't like is that the insights section has changed & there is no longer the opportunity to interact with other users by talking about how they handle experiences that you may be going through as well. Instead there are a bunch of quizzes aimed at marketing products to you. Bring back the forums!,4
809,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I love this app. I wish there were some more customizable options like similar apps, especially for symptoms, but so far it's been amazing. It adjusts with the information I add, it is easy to use, and there are some amazing articles posted daily. Want to give 5 stars but I would need to see an expanded selection of options. To be fair though I'm sure that adds a lot of work behind the scenes since every option provides information to improve cycle predictions.",4
810,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This is now my new all in one health tracker and I love it! I'm one of those weird people who hates having a ton of apps. I'd rather have one to do it all and this does it. My only complaint is to have the pedometer under a different notification setting for Android so I can keep it minimized without affecting the other notifications that I want to pop up. I'd also like to see options for tracking blood pressure and blood sugar, but that's not a huge deal as it can be inputted into the notebook.",4
811,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I like that this app added more options in regards to symptoms and exercise, but I do wish there were more customization options. I would also like more TTC specific articles to pop up after I turned on the TTC option rather than telling me the difference between tampons, pads, and menstrual cups (spoiler alert: I've been having a monthly period over half my life. I know what they are). nevertheless, it is easy to navigate and I like tracking my BBT, period, & other symptoms to explore patterns.",4
812,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Easy to use and informative. Not all that useful for people with irregular cycles except as a tracker. Personally, I have PCOS and endometriosis. I had hoped the AI would be able to pick up on patterns I couldn't and help us get pregnant. After 19 months, no patterns have emerged. Still a good record keeper. The Dr's chats are good and informative. A lot of it I've heard from my PCPs and OBGYNs l, but if I was new to the world of fertility, it would be wonderful. Overall, it's a good app.",4
813,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Great app, and pretty accurate too especially since it tracks ovulation, periods, and pms. The only thing I don't like is that it has a lot of notifications (which is fine, sometimes the things I learn are interesting and helpful) and that a lot of the courses need to be paid for to access. Edit: Oh, and don't bother using the chat rooms if you are seriously looking for advice on whatever topic because most of the people are pre-teens and young teens who use them as an anonymous social media.",4
814,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Edit to add: somehow my birthday got erased which is what caused the issue. They're fixing it promptly so no complaints. :) other than that issue, I've loved the app. The only thing they could improve is the BBT chart. Previous: App isn't working like it used to. I use to get insights and now haven't had any in at least a month. It just says no stories for today. And nothing here yet. But I've been using the app for a long time so I don't understand.",4
815,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I have used this app for years and I really love it. However, it's starting to take too much space for an app I only need for tracking my periods. It is pretty accurate but I don't need to pay extra for all the other perks it offers. For an older phone, it's too bloated to keep around. Maybe a lite version would be good for people like me who only really need to track their periods and this one for people wanting the premium features.",4
816,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Who woulda thunk it? A period app could be so amazing! Log beginning and end of your period, heaviness of flow, your mood, other events that affect your period. The more you log in, the more personalized insight you get. If something is off, you get tons of helpful insights about what could be causing it. There's ads but they're not too bad. Some content is unviewable without a subscription but this works for me perfectly.",4
817,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Only bad experience I've had so far is when I set a notification to go off for let's say drinking water, it says it's on but doesn't do the notification until I get onto the app that day. I have to get on the app just to get reminded to drink water?? Kind of defeats the purpose! Other than that. I've used this app for probably 4 year's now, through 1 pregnancy-switches to different app which is cool! I love this app for all the symptom features, exercising, etc. Also it predicts my . well!!❤❤❤",4
818,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This is an easy to use app for tracking your period. I've been using it for a few years now and it's been great. Using the graphs to see my period trends has been helpful since I'm in perimenopause so my periods are inconsistent. One of the features I liked was the step counter that would display on the landing page. Now I see it's gone 😭. This is a real bummer since I used it fairly regularly and I have the premium version. Suppose I can use one of the other apps, this was just super easy",4
819,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Great app but is there any way you could put to ""period started"" and ""period ended"" option back? I've noticed that I've been much less consistent with the app since it was removed because I don't like the process of editing dates. Without going into too many personal details, the fact that it just checks days based on my predictions is really not helpful so i almost always end up having to go back in and edit the dates if i can remember. It's just not as easily synced into my life as before.",4
820,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Really easy to use, very comprehensive and informative. Only slight downside is the UI could be a smidge better; the calendar isn't the easiest to view as all the numbers look so similar so it's hard to tell which one is ovulation date vs today's date. I get confused almost every time when trying to see where in the week I'm at. But that could just be me :] Overall a great app, i definitely recommend it!!",4
821,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Been using this consistently for the past 5 years.... absolutely love how easy it is to enter data, the interface to view it, and the analysis it offers. Tried a few others but nothing compares. Thank you for keeping this fresh and easy to use. One request is to offer more syncing options with other apps. I use Samsung Health and Garmin just as regularly and it'd be great to see all my data for a holistic view.",4
822,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Love the app but it could a few more options for symptom tracking. A button for ""furious"" or ""angry"" or ""back of or I'll shank you"" would be nice... Seriously though, it is missing a few emotions for tracking. Funny it's missing anger since I think it's so common. Other than that it's pretty good. Update: would really be nice to have the ability to speed up the videos. I just don't have the patience to sit and listen when the speaker speaks in super slow mode. Maybe offer transcription?",4
823,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've been using this app for a while now. It is accurate when predicting my period. I like the insights and health advise. The downside is; I had two miscarriages while using it and there was no option to put that information in, so the tracker was not predicting accurate for a while because of this. Also the constant prompts to pay for premium version is annoying. But I would recommend this app because the basic version works pretty well and does what it is supposed to do.",4
824,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've been using this app for awhile and while it works and gives good insight, every possible second they're shoving their paid version down your throat. A lot of the time, you can't proceed to basic functionality of the app without going through their automated pop-ups and such trying to get you to upgrade. It's definitely annoying.",4
825,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've been able to track my period, ovulation, and even my pregnancy...very useful app! Update: I still love the app and its content. However, it has been difficult trying to change my pregnancy info. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app and there were still some issues as the app tends to save prerecorded data. Also, I would love it if I could log personal notes and reminders. This can be done somewhat using the calender feature but only after that specific date has come or passed.",4
826,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I actually like the app. I've been using it since 2018 to track my cycle, but mostly my fertility. However, it would be very helpful to have a displayed function for tracking and planning according to basal body temperature as well, as some women like myself are more inclined towards natural birth control. If that were in the package, I'd get the membership.",4
827,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This is a great period tracking app! It's always accurate within a day or two, it has options to log all of your symptoms and your flow, it can be synced with your Fitbit, it has a private chatroom (I don't use it, but I can see others appreciating it,) it has a few customizing options, and it doesn't have any ads. All in all it's a solid app!",4
828,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Great for period and reproductive health! It has its issues but I came back after a year for a reason. That reason partly being that it syncs with Google fit. Generally I find the symptoms and moods adequate and appreciate that I can select high sex drive w/o it logging sex. My 3 dislikes are: only 1 huge widget, the ads and marketing for premium is borderline obtrusive, and unlike some apps, there isn't a way to see what your current phase is unless it's ovulation or bleeding.",4
829,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I have used this app for years! I love all the options to track and the info has always been great. I am a little disappointed at how little info is available now unless you have a paid subscription. I think putting ads geared towards women, their health, and families to keep the info free would be a better option. I also wish that it was easier to make changes to your health profile. I can't access it to edit.",4
830,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I wish there was more variety for like spotting color like brown/red and calculated that in for period or just spotting. Also with the ovulation test, I wish it would be like a line to chose from instead because I can't always tell if it's positive or negative and it would be easy to see if it was getting lighter or darker than the prior day but overall it's a good app",4
831,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Does its job, but the widget is broken. When scrolling to it, it often resets to where the prediction is the next day. You have to open Flo (or close it if it's already open beforehand) to reset it properly. It's a minor inconvenience. It is also strange that you charge for most things that can easily be found online for free, such as the articles. If I can't see it free on there, I can simply look it up.",4
832,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It's a good app. helpful for keeping track of the cycle and predictions are pretty accurate. I personally wish it gave you more insights on physical symptoms, or even just the things you log in general. some of the ""insights"" seem almost irrelevant and are just random blog-type posts. Like, they aren't necessarily geared towards me. Maybe it's just me. Overall, pretty good.",4
833,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"My favorite period tracker app so far, I originally just wanted something to track cycle dates but the little reminders of how the cycles affect my hormones and wellbeing give me a piece of mind when I wonder why I'm feeling off. The digital assistant is a cool feature, I use the free version so I don't have access to all the extras. The ads are also not very intrusive which is good.",4
834,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Helps keep me up to date on my cycle among other things as well! Let's me input my emotions, symptoms, flow, weight, water intake, etc. I would recommend getting this over other period tracker apps! The only downside is that some of the features require you to get the monthly subscription, which I don't have, but it would be nice to have that available to you.",4
835,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Has been great, but not a fan of the way premium content is advertised. Having premium options is great but the way it is advertised in the app is a bit too in my face. It sucks to start trying out a new feature, like the chat assistant and then find out part way through that you need to sign up for premium. It feels less friendly and more market-y. I'd like to see the premium ads scaled back some, maybe more as an opt in ad rather than combining it with the app's basic features",4
836,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I absolutely love this app and rely on it. I've been using it for a while now and had no problems until all of a sudden you have to pay for what was free. I did pay for a year subscription accidentally and thinking should I continue to pay. The free version is good as well but the subscription is better. I feel like they could have done better when it comes to charging us for what we already had free. 4 stars would have been 5 if it wasn't for pricing.,4
837,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I have the premium version of this app because I really liked it and have used it for a long time. But I get frustrated that there's no charts of mood fluctuations throughout your cycle. I log it every day so there should be some kind of way to see around what times of the month I might get depressed or frustrated. It would be really helpful. I appreciate the other charts too, but I really wish there was a feature to chart everything.",4
838,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"As nice and useful as it is, it is annoying to use as you are asked about the subscription service constantly. It will attempt to scare you with warnings about health issues just to advertise again. I can't just log my symptoms or check my dates without closing at least 2 ads. If I want it, I'll get it. It's free to log dates, at least allow me that.",4
839,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"i love this app. its relatively simple to use, and is surprisingly accurate. i find that its almost never off, and if it is, it's only by a day or two. also, if you change devices, say, a new phone, as long as you log in, it'll save your past cycles for you. i like knowing when i can expect my period. the only complaint is premium. i find that there's not a lot of things one can do without premium, so thats kind if a let down. but overall, i find this app to be very useful and i recommend it.",4
840,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I like this app, but I'm moving from a different app. Flo is superior, BUT my old app allowed you to see your specific symptoms in the full month mode. It had a calendar that allowed you to set up a lay out of symptoms or statuses with symbols that you could customize. That way you could look at your calendar as a whole and notice trends, like weight, temp, cycles, etc, instead of going to specific days to see what your status is. Wish this app would do the same. I also should it tracked mucous.",4
841,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It's a great app in general. I'm just annoyed by the pop up ""helpers"" that always end in ""To get more details, try premium!"" I understand that apps cost money. I think the additional resources are great for those that go premium. Maybe I'll try it one day, but until then just let me use the basic without interruption.",4
842,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"i like this app a lot. It really gives you a lot of options and even gives you daily info which is quite interesting to read about our bodies and such. My only problems are sometimes I don't get the notification to take my medicine on time and I wish there was another option besides ""taken on time"" and ""took pill the next day"" for those who maybe took the pill but later than specific time. Other than those 2 things the app is really good and helpful :)",4
843,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I think this app does a really good job at informing me about my own body. I've learned a lot through the secret chats where many women share their personal stories and it really provides that support system. I just really wish that as a regular user one could have more access to the other content that someone with premium would otherwise have :/,4
844,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I really enjoy the app. The one thing i wish i could do tho was be able to filter days that fall under certain parameters. Specifically, i want to be able to filter my calendar or pull up a report that shows me all the dates that i marked on my calendar that i was spotting. I feel like this feature would be useful to pull up this info if youre going to a doctors visit.",4
845,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I have really enjoyed this app. The reminders I get about how I might be feelings and tracking my symptoms is very useful. I don't have premium but I would consider it when I have more income. My two dislikes are it only has one version of birthcontrol. I just started the nuva ring and I don't feel like I can track that accurately. I also got a new phone and my account information did not transfer over. I had to manually put in data because I had over a year of use on it I didn't want to lose.,4
846,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This helps me a lot with tracking my period! It's just there's times when they bother you saying ""don't forget to track your period"" when literally I have a late period or something. I love it don't get me wrong, it's just annoying. I also love the assistant they have to help women with any issues or questions they might have about their emotions or feelings. 100% recommend 👌",4
847,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Works as intended, but ads for your service are so annoying. I don't want to to pay for it and I never will. I just want to know when my period will happen, nothing else! I don't want to go through so many slides just so I can check the app once or twice a month. Other than that, it works EXTREMELY well and is very very accurate to the exact day after a bit over a year of use.",4
848,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Flo is awesome for easily logging periods/cycle length & symptoms (not just during periods) and tracking other health factors like water intake & sleep. The constant ads for the premium version are admittedly annoying, but having used the trial, it may be worth it if you want an in-depth analysis. I just wish that it was clearer which features are paid, & that the app was more gender-neutral in its language and color scheme. At least maybe have more options for different-colored themes?",4
849,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I changed my 5 star rating to a 4. Before I got pregnant, I'd get daily insights. I thought they were interesting and helpful. After I became pregnant, same thing. At 7 weeks I had a miscarriage. It did give me some daily articles to read on that subject, which were so helpful at the time. However, those articles continue to remain 3 months later. I am TTC again, but I no longer get daily advise and the miscarriage articles remain, always reminding me of that painful time. I miss the daily advis",4
850,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Over the past year, this app has been so amazing and informative for me. I diligently used it, and was truly excited to do so everyday . . . but a lot of the features that once set it apart and taught me so much have now been taken away from free users. It's really disappointing that they decided to restrict so many of the features to premium only and took away what was once accessible and helpful. I still like using the app, and it's a nice tracker, but it's not as enjoyable as before.",4
851,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Pros: Works good enough. Predictions are mostly accurate. it's good as a calendar and tracking habits and symptoms. Cons: insights into health behind symptoms cuts off and makes you upgrade to read the full insight. I think health insights should be automatically part of the app and asking for upgrades should be for the less important stuff like beauty secrets or positive affirmations.,4
852,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I really like this app. It is good for period tracking but I would enjoy if the articles weren't premium because it would have helped to read some during my first period. Other than that great for tracking and a variety of symptom to choose from and track. So yeah if they make it so those premium articles you didn't pay for would be better.,4
853,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"For several weeks the app has, upon launching, had me enter my PIN twice before actually unlocking and opening to input my info. Even after a few updates it's still doing this, but it didn't do this when I first downloaded and opened an account in December. Just wondering if I need to uninstall and reinstall or if you have any other suggestions!",4
854,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Helps me keep track of things and gives good information on why I may be feeling the way I feel. The free version is just as solid as the one you pay for.

The free version tends to bait users to encourage them to buy premium access to all the helpful info. It's annoying but I get it, they have to make money, and honestly I just go Google it anyway. Wish it had a search function...",4

ALSO PLEASE stop that wiggling motion the other options do...it can set off my vertigo and nausea 😰😠. One other thing, when reporting how heavy things get, maybe have one extra degree of drops so that I don't get ""is your period really that heavy, chances are..."" To me it sounds condescending, if I'm pressing heavy then it's heavy for me, I might not be changing my protection every hour but I think it needs the warning of extremely heavy but in my individual experience, it's heavy.",4
857,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,It works well. It was very informative during my pregnancy as well but the number of notifications you receive is a bit annoying and now that I am on birth control and do not have periods every month there needs to be an option to confirm that you know why you aren't having one so you stop receiving the notifications,4
858,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,App overall is great with adaptive cycle predictions and insights. My only wish is that the symptom tracking was more hourly or by general time of day like you had a headache in the morning but felt fine in the evening and so on. Those specific time frames might not be super related to cycle tracking but could be helpful for people for overall health tracking as well.,4
859,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The real issue I have with this app is that it's so focused on pregnancy. I use it to track my period just so I know when to expect it and am currently switching birth control so my period is wonky. The app will not stop trying to convince me to see if I'm pregnant. I can't imagine how this feels to women who are entering menopause, transgender, tubal litigation, or are infertile. I genuinely wish there was a mode that was simply track period, the end, because otherwise Flo is excellent.",4
860,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Overall great app! I wish there was a way to log if I stopped/started birth control- when I stopped birth control (a few months ago now), I had a weird month on my cycle and now it tells me constantly I have an irregular cycle due to the one month. It's not consistently irregular, so it's just annoying that it always says it. I did cave and get the Premium, but it's a reasonable $$. I love the ""this is how you'll probably feel today and here's why""- it's been increasingly accurate!!",4
861,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app is a great way to track period symptoms and days! My only frustration is that I can't sign in with Google. I was able to recover my password and reload past data in time to see I wasn't as behind as I thought, after a recent data loss. Most months it has been great to see how many days along I was and what types of symptoms I had in the recent past easily. Reporting symptoms is as easy as pushing a button for each. The widget is also nice for quickly seeing where you are in your cycle.",4
862,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Taking away a star because it's not as perfect as I wish it was. As a trans man, it's a bit uncomfortable having to be constantly referred to as a woman, but I'm sure that's just me. I don't want ""suggestions"" on when to get pregnant either. The feature might be nice for some, but I have no clue how to turn mine off. The app works as it needs to and reminds me when periods are coming, but I wish it was a little more encapsulating of trans guys. :(",4
863,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Great app for anyone who wants to keep better track of their cycle and other health related issues and fitness. The one feature I wish they would update is the activity selections. Or at least give the option to edit the ""other"" category to add our own activity. I love Pickleball. It is a fast growing sport and think it should be added.",4
864,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I have been using this for a long time. Since before they decided to start charging for premium. I have to say, I'm not happy about that part. But even the free version is super nice. I can still track everything I need to. It's super accurate, and easy to use. The newer feature of being able to talk with others about bedroom life, downstairs questions and issue is super nice. Makes you feel like everything you're going through is perfectly normal. I highly recommend this app for any age!",4

Use it for whatever your need is (ovulation tracking for pregnancy, symptoms to more accurately predict next cycle, etc - it's all there and more!) My only complaint is that now that they've added a ""pay"" option, many if not all of the articles that can be useful/helpful you can't get to unless you pay. If articles aren't your main objective, a definite app to use.",4
866,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I really enjoy this app to track my periods, and it helps keep me on track if I miss one. However suddenly the widget disappeared! Being able to see the calendar on my home screen helped my brain process to log the period instead of saying, ""I'll do it later,"" so I was super consistent in it!! Can we please bring back the widget? Or is it some kind of issue on my part??",4
867,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Flo is great for helping you keep track of your cycle, ovulation & chance of pregnancy throughout your cycle. There are informative q&a sessions on multiple topics also. It's somewhat annoying that they continually send notifications for membership fees, but if you can swing it (they do offer deals and it gives you access to even more info/features) I would! Overall, I highly recommend it for any woman who wants more control over her reproductive health!",4
868,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I liked the app more before the big change to the user interface. Now there are these cards midway down the page with ""Daily Insights"" a.k.a. things I have no interest in, and it pushes the premium service a little too hard for my taste. I do love the ability to see cycle history but the most helpful features are cash-locked, some of which IIRC used to be free.",4
869,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Nice and very accurate cycle tracking for me. I like the basic features but could do without all the items blocked behind a pay wall, more distracting and time consuming to click out of all the pop ups when you just want it for tracking. Overall this isn't a huge issue just a small annoyance.",4
870,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I like the app so far. I have been using the app since May. The only 3 things I would change would be to allow users to add moods that are not already preloaded, add symotoms that are not already preloaded, and allow users to sync Samsung Galaxy watches to the app to track steps and other things. Moods like tired, forgetful, lethargic, options for increased or decreased appetite, etc aren't in the app.",4
871,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Has always worked well with me and definitely helps with keeping track of my period. Although, the amount of notifications I get is annoying and I had to completely turn them off through my phones settings because the app does not have the option to turn off all notifications.",4
872,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Quite good generally! I like how many symptoms there are there are to choose from and the app works in general. But it's not great with tracking missed periods. I missed mine this month (not due to pregnancy) and now the app just won't predict my next one. It says ""enter the first day of your last period for more information""...I think there should be a certain point when they start planning for the next one. I don't know when to expect my period now. It's a great app overall though!",4
873,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It's very simple and easy to use, plus I love the design of it. However, I don't really like the secret chats because people can get pretty rude and gross. I've also had to change a lot of preferences because of all the uncomfortable and inappropriate (in my opinion) topics posted for discussion. But overall, it's still a good app to keep track of everything.",4
874,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've loved this app for a couple years. It's helped me keep some semblance of record of my lady health. Very thankful. But over the past few months though, the premium teases have made using this app far less of an enjoyable experience. Makes me feel out of the loop, or that I don't care enough, when previously I used to feel quite the opposite when I'd come to Flo. For that change, I'm giving 4. I could do without the premium push. Otherwise 5 stars.",4
875,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Pros: It's nice to log how you're feeling, what you're feeling, etc. I like how you can choose the layout and you can change the background. It's nice and easy to use. Predictions are spot on for me. Cons: The app does give you daily insights if you log certain things, but when you tap on one of those daily insights, it shows you one part of it. Then, it tells you to pay for Premium to see the rest. I'm not going to pay for a period tracking app. Premium gets advertised alot.",4
876,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've had a lot of period apps. Literally tried them all. This one is top 2!! Very accurate at predicting. Only thing missing is being able to edit or add symptoms. I usually just type it into notes, but everyone has different symptoms and I would love if the symptom log had more or we were able to add in our own icons.",4
877,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The app works great helping me track my period. It also allows me to track SOME symptoms. One symptom that coukd be added is blood clots (big or small). Also, I wish it provided more feedback for athletes. For example... this is a good week to push yourself lifting.... vs this is a week to slow down on carbs... etc... just useful infor for those concerned with fitness.",4
878,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've had this app for a couple years and its good. Although I prefer the old version that wouldn't withhold information to trick you into purchasing their overpriced subscription. I understand they need to make money, but withholding information about your own body is just wrong. What I think would be better is if they let you access all features and information but with ads, and you can pay to get rid of the ads. All women deserve to know as much information about their body as they want.",4
879,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app is really good! I would recommend this to girls( or whomever is on there time) just started there period. It helps with not only tracking your period, but also tips and tricks to help on your health, ache, acne and much more! The reason why I'm putting a 4/5 is because the tracking isn't the most accurate. But it will get better over time the more you use it. I had mine for over a year and it's improved so much. I hope this helps. 👍🙏🙂",4
880,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've been using this for close to three years now, and I do love it. I'm not trying to get pregnant, nor am I at risk for an unplanned pregnancy, so I'd love to be able to get rid of that aspect (I've applied that setting, but still get annoying info about pregnancy). This would be 5 stars for me if we had access to the lunar cycle through this same app.",4
881,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This is a great app and I've used it for years. It is very accurate and offers lots of information. But this app needs to have a parameter for misscarage's and such for you to mark as well. After a women has a miscarriage this app cannot track your cycle properly. It doesn't have a section to mark such a thing. Speaking as someone who has had a miscarriage and had no way to track their menstrual cycle properly after, a parameter for such things would help greatly.",4
882,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The only reason I'm giving this 4 starts instead of 5 is because you have to pay to read any of the articles. When I first downloaded, I couldn't read all of the daily articles, but I could read part of 1 or 2 of them. Now, you have to pay to read any of all of them. I really enjoy the tracking feature and all of the options of things to track. This app helped me keep track of my periods and predict my ovulation in order to help me get pregnant with our daughter!",4
883,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,This app is great for tracking and predicting your period. I really like that you can change the focus based on your goals like getting pregnant or just simply tracking your cycle. I use the app all the time to plan trips. There are also some good articles and recommendations from professionals in the app. I would recommend this app.,4
884,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This is a good app overall. My only problem is that my reminders have been hit and miss for me. For example, I recently started a new medication which I've been instructed to take twice a day. I got the reminder for the first dose, but not the second one. Perhaps it's either a technical difficulty or there's something missing on my end? Overall, I truly admire the intention of this app, and I will still continue to use it!",4
885,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This is a really nice menstrual tracking app - it has a lot of features and options, more than others I've used. The only thing it's missing is a cervical position tracker - a big part of natural family planning is tracking cervical position in addition to cervical mucous and basal body temp, so I'd like to see that added in the future. For now, the notes section is serving that purpose for me.",4
886,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I really like this app a lot. The graphics are amazing and colorful and it's so fun to use. The only thing that bothers me is that all of the articles are locked and you have to pay as monthly subscription to view them. That is very annoying, there should be some articles that are free to view by anyone while others you have to subscribe for.",4
887,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app is an amazing tracker, but there are some premium options that I think shouldn't be premium. For example, my period has been late and they asked me to take a quiz to figure out why. After them starting with some introductory info, they told me it was a premium feature. I feel like this feature and many others shouldn't be premium. It just sucks because besides this the app is a lifesaver.",4
888,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've been using this app for years and haven't really found one I like more. I like the layout of it mostly. I think the chats are pretty useless though and one thing I would really like is the option to store LH test strips. It has the BBT option, it would be nice to also be able to put the strips in to get an accurate ovulation day.",4
889,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I loved this app but dropped it down to a 4 star. Once my subscription ended it hounded me to renew, but never showed me a price just asked to update my pay info. It had a pretty noticeable 79% off tab but stated no original price. I'll give my payment info when I know I can afford the price. ""If there's no visible price, then it's probably expensive""",4
890,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,The app works and helps you track your period. The UI to input your symptoms and period could be better. It's not worth paying for the extra content because it gets repetitive over time and you don't get much out of it. I found the content to be very generic and similar to Google search results. Didn't feel like I was getting a personalized experience based on the information I was giving them.,4
891,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Imo the best female app. It tracks not only my period correctly but my ovulation. Also has all the info i need and i can describe each day in detail with just a couple taps. I'm pregnant now and it gives me great baby updates. Edit: the app suddenly began charging me to see things I already saved in the past, I complained about it here and now it's fixed! So thanks, Flo team. 4 out of 5 stars because it often has an ad to upgrade that makes you look at it for a couple seconds.",4
892,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,This app is great and super helpful when tracking your period. But now they want you to pay for unlimited access to the app. It's super annoying and I hate it! So I just stick with the free basic version of the app. I wish they would get rid of the premium version all together. The app was much better when everything was free for its users.,4
893,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"this has generally been a good app for tracking both fertility cycles and now pregnancy. I wish there were an option to add your own symptoms into the checklist, not just adding a note (which is, comparatively, hard to get to). I don't want to have to add a note every time I have heartburn.",4
894,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Usually, this app is great. It is very accurate and helpful. However, the introduction of premium content undermines the purpose of which this app was designed, to help all women with period tracking and health insights. It is understandable though. Really bummed this feature was added. :/",4
895,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I used to love this app but the premium ads now are annoying. Especially since the features I used before, I now am being asked to pay for. It's also annoying to ask us for all of this information, then tell us we have to pay in order to submit it, and not allow me to leave the ad without closing the app down. Still my favorite tracker though.",4
896,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I have used this app for a few years now. It is a very good app for what I have needed it for. I am kind of bummed that the predictions became a paid feature though but not a deal breaker. After using the pregnancy feature, I think that being able to log that I am breastfeeding would be useful. Some women don't have a period while breastfeeding which is why I think this could be a useful added feature.",4
897,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Flow is a great app that provides and opportunity for girls who don't have a mother figure in their life to learn about what their bodies are doing during their cycle! I love the feature where girls can talk to other girls about their periods without being scared of judgement! The reason I chose not to give this app 5 stars is because it isn't accessible! It is completely usable and still great without premium features but it should be free to all because lots of girls can't buy it!,4
898,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Does a good job of helping keeping track of cycles and predicting future ones. Will be helpful for anyone planning on getting pregnant or trying to avoid it. It's very useful for knowing when your body is about to bring the pain! Has little articles and social sites for sharing all things woman for anyone interested in that kind of thing. Some of the non professional advice in those should definitely be taken with a grain of salt. The basics are pretty useful, especially if your cycles are off",4
899,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Update 08/08/2022- Issue has been resolved with email support from flo. Issue was that DOB was needed on file. FYI, there is no way to add that yourself in app and should be made available to users to do so. Old review -Where are all the features? I just started my free trial with the intention to continue my subscription and there is no secret chat, no messages offering insights, nothing telling me what I might be feeling as I'm getting closer to my period.",4
900,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,It's good 😊,4
901,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Been using this app for over 5years and it has been accurate for my periods and my two pregnancies.,4

912,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,This app is great... can y'll make the update with a dark mode setting,4
913,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The app is great overall, however, it's pretty heteronormative for the partner feature to exclusively be directed for men. For example, ""He'll know when your sex drive might be high"". I'm sure many users have partners who aren't men so inclusivity in the aspect is important for the development team to consider.",4
914,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Really cool app, it has helped regulate my period. It's really really cool 👍",4

924,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I like this app this app know when I start or when I end but some times it's just late for like 1 day but it doesn't counts right?,4
925,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I have been using Flo app for years, to me it's the best Period and Prego app. 👌",4
926,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Flo Premium is 100% free. OMG Lovin' the app.,4
927,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I have found this app more and more useful. Is there a way to connect it to a 3rd party app such as google fit? I can't seem to figure it out,4
928,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Really easy to use .has some great articles and info as well .,4
929,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Very good It my first time using Flo and it had help me a lot. Thank you,4
930,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,it's a nice app..been using it for the past 2yrs and it's still good,4
931,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Something I don't understand is that you are supposed to be atleast 13 years old to use it.. but the years end in 2008? Isn't it supposed to end in 2011 because those are 13 year Olds? Or 2010 because you're sure they're 13? (Some are even 14) This is a great app, truly but this just bugged me",4
932,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,It is a good app for periods and pregnancy track,4
933,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Could someone tell me how to change the language? In the other phone that I used,this app was in portuguese,but I switched to this and the app appeared in english,and I can't switch it until now.",4
934,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Using flow premium since they have given it free in india hope it helped so many it helped me to track my pregnancy journey and now my babies growth thank you guys Update: immediately after you guys response I had raised ticket and I never heard from you guys nor got refund App is good but when it comes to premium membership it's too costly, I was supposed to take 14 days free membership but it was charged me 720 Rs",4

939,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Great app for females' guidance ...,4
940,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Good experience kept me updated,4
941,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I use this app with my partner. She provided the link code and all the information in there is SUPER useful! Just a few things i think would be cool. I noticed on her side theres a secret chats section where the women can ask other women questions. It would be nice for the partners to also interact in that same way. Asking for advice from other partners about symptoms and such. Maybe theres still the section for only the girls but if there was another section for with the partners as well,4
942,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,It's great overall 👍🏼and helpful but chat assistant may talk about new things,4
943,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It's extremely easy to learn and trust me, it's really accurate. Those tips always help you out some way or another. Recommended!",4
944,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I just use this app to remember when I had ny period so I have an idea other than that tracking ovulation accurately isn't something an app can do so I don't expect that. It does what I need it to do so it's great.,4
945,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Good experience,4
946,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Flo is really a great app to track your menstrual cycle, and it has customisation preference as per your need ' Track Cycle's , Trying to Pregnant ', 'pregnenct tracking '.",4

951,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"They've overcomplicated what was a good app and they are really pushy with the premium subscription service, it leaves you wanting to delete it.",4
952,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I like this app, have been using it for a year now and it is awesome. Just one thing I would add, for us women who have some diseases like PCOS or something else, that we could add that onto the app and that would help us keep track of our period more accurately.",4
953,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Very Informative and useful 👍,4

This app used to give you information and advice for free. It's just really sad to see this amazing app go towards spaming their users to buy the premium subscription. Please get rid of premium and go back to being an app women can use freely. We have to go through and pay for enough.",4

Please please ♡ I've had the app for a while now and I thought I knew a lot about myself but Flo changed how I think and plan daily.

968,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've been paying for the premium version and it's been super nice and helpful to track my periods, symptoms, and more. But I really wish there was a way to add different types of physical activity to this app because I don't do any of the cliche ones. I snowboard. I swim. Callisthenics etc. I also wish there was a way to note if you had to take emergency contraceptives aside from OCs. The app premium isn't that expensive per year too, which I like.",4
969,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I would like to log more pms or if I used a test and the results of said test should all be in there lol or a pop quiz to get an accurate result of said test like ovation of how faint the line is kinda thing 😅 it would be five stars then for me,4

993,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I really like this app, it's interface is really good looking and convenient, I like statistics and insights as well. But, there's a huge but for me, application interacts with the user in a really intrusive way. I don't want reports or dialogs right at the moment I'm adding my symptoms. It's so annoying, so sometimes I really consider to use different app despite here I have years of usage. I want just to see a dynamic after all and not conversate with the app all the time!",4

999,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Great I love it,4
1000,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Update: Not changing the rating, still a great app. I actually do recommend it to others. The core of the app, the period tracking, is free and phenomenal. All the extra stuff - lessons, data analysis, community forums - are behind a monthly subscription. It's a little annoying but honestly it all works out. I paid for it for a year and then realized that I never used all the bells and whistles so I stopped. Worth it if you actually interact with it. Overall this app has really helped me :)",5
1001,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've had the app since before you could pay a subscription and recommend it highly. The sub gives you some nice stuff, but even just the free portion of the app is amazing. I've struggled with quite a few problems with my cycle, and it's still kept pretty accurate through those irregularities and has done great at telling me when and what to be concerned about.",5
1002,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've used this app for YEARS and it's the absolute best and most convenient period tracker out there!!! I have PCOS, endometriosis, and other reproductive health problems and irregular periods are just part of it and this app is always accurate within a day. It's customizable and has several options as to what your trying to achieve as well so it's a all in one app for females of all ages and stages of life!!",5
1003,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I just wish the entire app was free, it's kinda expensive in the long run. The free part does have a lot to offer though. Definitely the best period tracking app by far, it's always extremely accurate. They have a lot of tips and you can openly share and talk about female problems anonymously. I love this app",5
1004,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Really beneficial and premium is worth it. I have felt way more confident about my cycle and can track irregularities and symptoms without it auto adjusting previous cycles. Now that I'm pregnant, I probably open the app 10 times a day just to read any new tips/facts. My only negative was that I needed to download a second app to track LH levels for accurate ovulation. If it was a feature available on Flo, then it would've been perfect!",5
1005,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Very insightful and interactive. Havent used it for very long yet, but the more periods you log with your symptoms, the more it learns about your patterns and can tell you whats going on. I dont always have the time, but there is a lot to read and learn which is super cool and I just find it fascinating and interesting.",5
1006,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Love this app! I'm learning more about my body and monthly cycle, and it easily helps me track ovulation which has been super helpful in my journey to get pregnant. I've even paid for a yearly subscription for Flo Premium two years in a row, which is a first - I've never felt like an app was worth enough to spend money on a premium version before, but in my opinion the $14.99 is more than reasonable for all the extra features you get.",5
1007,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I really like this app. Very useful for tracking ovulation and menstration, and for NFP. There are many items you can log if youd like which is very nice. It would be helpful if there was another option for menstration so as ""very heavy"" or ""very light"". I like having the calendar to see trends and being able to add/edit past data. The articles sometimes interesting and mostly informative. It is a little inaccurate on prediction days so i have been marking that in my notes.",5
1008,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I LOVE this app. It not only tracks your flow but also tracks weight, sleep, water intake, etc. And when you are trying to get pregnant and log a period, it gives you encouraging messages, access to talk to other women who are trying to conceive, as well as articles to reference. It's a lot more than what I was expecting from a period tracker.",5
1009,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Very helpful tool for any menstruating woman. Would definitely recommend. I do wish it was easier to access my health history. I can only see 6 months back, though I've been logging for much longer. Would also like if I could track workouts, as that changes my cycle patterns. Also may be just a bit too mature for young girls, but I don't consider that an issue, just something for parents to be aware of.",5
1010,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Great app for tracking your period. I'd say the one downside is that it took the cycle predictor a few months to adjust to my longer cycle. It kept trying to put me on a 28 day cycle (which would be lovely in real life) but I'm more like 33-35 days. Once it adjusted though, its almost always spot on, give or take a day. Would recommend to a friend!",5
1011,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I have had other tracking apps in the past but have found this one to be the most accurate. I also love that you can set it to just track periods or to predictions when trying to conceive or to pregnancy mode when you've succeeded. I also appreciate that all the ""insights"" and many ways you can track all your symptoms. I absolutely love this app and plan on continuing to use it.",5
1012,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Love this app! I've used it for 3 years, including a planned pregnancy. I rely on this app to anticipate my period and ovulation and I use that information to avoid pregnancy, as I don't like other forms of birth control. The only thing I would change is that they repeatedly remind me about their membership (which does include some great looking features), but I just use the free features right now, so it's annoying to constantly have those ads come up. It's fine though because it's a great app.",5
1013,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Easy tracker, but not enough options. The free option of this tracker is great, but I wish it gave the option to add conception option. It doesn't give the choice to put a contraception in that will effect the period. It does have the option to change to pregnancy and ovulation, which is nice. *Updated to 5 * because I apparently missed the memo about contraception on one of the recent updates.",5
1014,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Originally DL this app as a way to track my ovulation as part of shettles method of gender selection. Its more than I expected and is very user friendly. Features I like are the BBT graphs, ovulation prediction (after a few months the last two months have been spot on), and ability to enter in vaginal discharge consistency. With the help of this app I have learned more about my body and what all that ""stuff down there"" really means.",5
1015,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The best app I've ever used by far! The predictions are unbelievably spot on. Data logged is saved. It accommodates typical female daily affairs: birth control, weight, & water logs with reminders. For a busy person like myself most days, I forget to drink a decent amount of water; therefore, it helps a lot to be reminded every few hours I choose. The best feature is ""Insights"". You learn so much about the female body & become aware that you have shared experiences with many other women. A recommendation would be more narrow ""physical activity"" options, like for ""team sports"" would give options like volleyball, basketball, etc. and Yoga would have meditation, etc. Also, more symptom and mood options would be great. PLEASE 😁",5
1016,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This is the best period tracker I've ever used! Features: accurate tracking, coping tips, insights, etc. This is so much easier than counting the days in your head or guessing. My period had inconsistencies that made it soooooo hard to track. This picks up on the inconsistency patterns for the best cycle predictions. This is EASILY one of my top 10 apps!!",5
1017,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Great app for keeping track of your cycle. My one and only frustration is the section where it tells you stuff. It's set up like chat, so they type a sentence, and you click the only reply available. So it's not chat, just something you're reading but you have to keep tapping responses. I feel like I'm just tapping ""read more"" after each sentence. I mean ""got it"", ""tell me more"" etc.. I just want to be able to read about my cycle without having to click.. click... click.. click..",5
1018,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I got the app and like a month or so after I got pregnant. It's definitely a coincidence that I got pregnant right after getting the app but the flow app did make my first trimester less stressful. It provides me helpful hints/articles of what to expect for that week and how it can be more manageable. Even though I am in my 2nd trimester, I still use it every week. And everytime I read the weekly update, my husband gets excited because it helps him be in the loop a little about the baby as well.",5
1019,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It's been pretty accurate despite my wildly irregular periods. I'm not really a fan of the pink/femme styling or the types of articles, but as a tracker it's good. It's not super cutesy, focused only on pregnancy, or completely rigid and useless like some I've used. I was happy to find one that was simple and worked at not only tracking but predicting.",5
1020,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Im weird when it comes to apps. I always have a million things going on and dont have time to figure out how to use a new one. Well this one is amazing. Super easy to use, very accurate. I LOVE the advice and little informal quizes they do. Because of those two things I have learned alot about my body; also explaining and pointing out things I never read much into. It also brought attention to a certian medical issue it picked up on by the patterns of my cycle that I wasnt even aware of.",5
1021,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It's really accurate and easy to use. my period isn't the most regular, but after only about 4 cycles or so it became super spot on. I'm not using it for the ovulation stuff, I just wanted an easy way to keep track of my period dates and symptoms, Flo does just that and more. the little blurbs of info, and the chat rooms are all super nice and really helpful. overall I highly recommend this app.",5
1022,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've been able to get pregnant multiple times (so far 3 in a little over a year) in large part thanks to this app. It's very easy to use/user friendly. I do wish it had the features that premom has with the auto LH strip reading and auto syncing BBT (with their brand BBT). But even without those things it's a really solid app. I do wish that I could edit my peak ovulation day, as it never seems to let me change it after ovulation is over and I 100% know for sure which day it was on.",5
1023,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It is so easy to use and makes tracking my symptoms and period sooo fun and easy! I would 100% recommend for any girl. There is so much information and a lot more than just a period tracker. It's personalized, too! You can chat with other girls and ask questions completely anonymously! It's an amazing app. I've gotten so much information and ideas.",5
1024,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Very detailed and useful. I needed to track my cycle more closely and the app has so many different physical, mental, and cycle-related tracking features that are a quick and easy way to collect your data for your next gyno visit. And it's right on your smart phone and convenient. The graph and calendar features are helpful for tracking cycle patterns. Even the advice and tip articles are tailored to the data you are inputting, which is great! Exactly what I was looking for.",5
1025,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Great way to keep track of your cycle! Being someone who really hasn't tracked hers since the beginning, it is nice to have a platform that easily tracks it for you and is very in depth on dates, times, mood, and overall flow. Now I have more of a concrete idea of when I am going to start feeling that pre-period moodiness and body changes! Such a simple and easily laid out app for those of us who would much rather avoid even the thought of our monthly ""known-surprise.""",5
1026,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Best period tracker app out there by a long shot. It's full of wonderful information about your the female body and what it does, and how to care for it. Easy to use and very informative. However, there needs to be a few things changed/added. In the ""My Symptoms"" section where you can track your mood, there are 14 options for your mood - 4 options are generally ""positive"", but the other 10? All ""negative"" or ""down"" moods. There definitely needs to be a more even choice among the spectrum.",5
1027,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I had this before and uninstalled because I didn't take the time to understand how to use it... I re-downloaded at my GYN's recommendation and I don't know if it's just less bugs, but it works so well! You can track whatever you want and even though you have the option to download like EVERYTHING you don't need to! You can still track so much!",5
1028,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I like it. It's easy to use and doesn't force the premium option on you. I'm happy that I can forget it's on my phone, then around my period it reminds me to log my symptoms and I do. I do wish more of their articles were free or if it was a one time payment rather than a subscription. I recently reset my phone and because I had made an account and backed up my info on this app I still had my data saved which was super convenient.",5
1029,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It works great as long as it's online and updated. When I (unfortunately) switched from iPhone to Android it stated I was 430 days late 😲 so, I had to refer to previous dates logged on my iPhone because it hadn't updated or synced for a few months due to being offline but my parameters and all other settings were perfect when I logged in to the app on my Android. Other than that it has been great and even reminds me multiple times to log my dates!",5
1030,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Very nice design, intuitive interface, and incredibly accurate once you get a few months in. Plus, it has a lot of useful articles and forums about periods and the female body in general. Personally, I don't need them, but they would be very helpful for someone who is going through puberty because these questions can be embarrassing to ask. Tbh, every now and then, I look through them and learn a little something new about my body.",5
1031,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"These developers are doing a wonderful job with all of the app features! I've been using it for 2 years now and it's been a very helpful tool not only in period tracking, but in understanding the body and it's hormone cycles. I especially like all the tips and articles on the female body and the new interactive feature that checks up on you. Even though I know about female reproductive health pretty well, I find new useful info, and I can definitely imagine women finding all of it educational.",5
1032,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app is fantastic! It not only tracks your period but has a ton of other features. You can track your mood and health, as well as weight, exercise, etc... There is also an interactive portion with discussions, articles, quizes ect... all related to women's health and I actually found it pretty interesting and learned a few things. The best period app I've tried, it almost distracted me from my horrifically painful cramps! This app is without a doubt one of the best apps I have ever used.",5
1033,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I love the flo app and I have recommended it on multiple occasions. It is super easy to use and understand, plus it gives you personalized insight on things everyday regarding your PMS symptoms. Not only that, it keeps track of your weight, water intake, sleep patterns, and footsteps. Plus you can program it to remind you to take medicine. Its awesome!",5
1034,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The only period tracker on which I've managed to log more than a month of data. I've been logging for 6 months now and have instantly found solace in knowing my general schedule instead of vaguely guessing. It's also easy to use, has an astheticlly pleasing interface and gives informative articles on a wide variety of topics. Would recommend to anyone.",5
1035,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Love it! It's so useful! I have endometriosis and have had irregular cycles since age 12. I sometimes skip months, and sometimes I can bleed for 2-3 months straight. Every time I'd go to the doctors, they'd ask when my last cycle was and I couldn't ever remember since it wasn't regular. This app took care of that! All I had to do was log it! I love how it tracks ovulation too. I've had issues with fertility too, and I did get pregnant while using this app and had my LO last year! ♡",5
1036,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I have use at least half a dozen fertility apps and I seriously love this app above all others! I have had 2 miscarriages in the last year and each time I miscarried when using other apps to track my cycle they would delete all the period data once you got pregnant. Which is super difficult because you want to be able to track everything before, during, and after. I like that Flo really allows me to track everything. Even when miscarrying they have an option where you can select that you've miscarried and continue tracking without losing any information. I also like that once you select that option you don't keep getting news feed about pregnancy. It goes back to a simple period tracker. Since miscarriage happens in about 1 in 5 pregnancies you would think that all the other fertility apps out there would include that as a feature. But this is the only one in my experience that makes any part of your ""Flo"" trackable. I would highly recommend to anyone!",5
1037,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've been using Flo for a while, and it's great at helping me keep track of my cycle and symptoms. I like it's reminders for when I'm hitting ovulation or when my cycle is about to begin in a few days. I have the free version, so of course, I'm constantly being asked to upgrade... that's the only ""annoying ads"" part, but I don't mind and just skip right thru those.",5
1038,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The only app worth paying for premium! I'm a woman w/ PCOS, taking several medicactions, struggling w/ symptoms of difficult periods, weight loss, and more. Flo helps me keep track of all of my symptoms, mood swings, etc to relay to my doctors. I don't have to think twice about when my last period was, or carry around a calendar to log. It's all right here on my phone! Easy to use, convenient, and helpful. I was terrible at tracking before Flo, but now it's a no brainer! Thanks for a great app!",5
1039,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Great app, very helpful and useful. It's pretty detailed and accurate. I love that there are sections with advice and articles on all sorts of subjects, definitely helps if you don't have an outlet to talk or learn about that type of stuff personally. I also love the added feature of the ""secret chats"" that lets you read through and talk to people as well as ask questions and relate to everyone's stories on it. Great app and concepts overall! :)",5
1040,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"An amazing app. I've tried several period apps over the years, but this one has topped them all. Everything is laid out nicely, and you can customize how you want it. So many options, and is actually extremely accurate as long as you continue to out in info everyday, including the days you're off of your period. Plus the facts it shows you daily are usually pretty interesting. I like being able to seeing the statistics of other women my age. It's very interesting if you enjoy science already.",5
1041,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app is amazing between the options for daily logging, the accuracy, helpful tips and articles based on YOUR symptoms, pretty backgrounds and the option of a lock, it's the best period app I've come across. You can make it a simple routine or a more in depth routine when using the app but the more you put in, the more you get out of the app.",5
1042,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app looks absolutely amazing, you can even customize the background to an extent. I love tracking on here, the calendar looks great. It's also super easy to use. Only complaint would be that there should be an option to remind you to track your symptoms, but you can use the option to remind you to take your pill to do this instead by editing it.",5
1043,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Literally my favorite app! It's sometimes spot on- on predicting, and the times it isn't, it's not far off. I love that they provide articles to read and learn from, especially when it suggests ones about something you just logged about. It's super informative, the community on this is amazing! Also, the layout is so easy to work with, provides more options to log things in compare to other apps, love the variety! You can also personalize a bit. Fantastic app! I suggest it every girl/woman I can.",5
1044,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app is so useful! I am able to accurately track my cycle while receiving insights about the symptoms I log. I've never felt so in tune with my body! I love being able to predict when my period is coming so I can plan around it. I also use it to determine when I'm most fertile so I can avoid having sex on those days. For someone trying to get pregnant, I think this app would be equally helpful since it has a pregnancy mode as well. The other great thing is that the longer you use this app, the more accurate it becomes at predicting your cycles. What a great tool for a woman to keep in touch with her body! Thank you to the developers for creating an empowering and useful app :)",5
1045,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I definitely love the app. It's really simple to use and easy to navigate through. I honestly wished there was some sort of watch or bracelet for it to sync to just so it could keep track of my steps as well because I work in a small medical clinic and I'm not allowed to have my phone on me. With that being said, I don't get the full amount of steps logged in. But overall, this app has worked great for me. **Never mind. I could literally get a Fitbit watch and sync it through there! Lol.",5
1046,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This is a great app! I've tried out a few cycle trackers (some integrated into other apps), and Flo is the best one that I have found. I like the ui, it's customizeable and has so many options for personalizing. The widget is really useful for at-a-glance tracking as well. I also look forward to Pregnancy Mode and not needing a second app for that. Whether you're trying to conceive, trying to avoid pregnancy, or trying to anticipate your period, this app is very useful.",5
1047,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The app does exactly as it says. It tracks your period and your ovulation quite well. As long as you log your period, the predictions stay pretty accurate, maybe off by a day. There are advertisements to upgrade, and if you need all the extra stuff awesome, but if not it's a little annoying. Luckily, that doesn't affect the apps ability to work properly with accuracy. I have had the app for over a year now and I am not disappointed. Highly recommended for anybody needing to track their period!",5
1048,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Great app for tracking periods and ovulation when trying to get pregnant! Love the educational opportunities, they have lots of videos and chat style features although I wish they would allow a little bit more under the free account instead of pushing towards the premium account. All in all a great app and I have tried a few different ones but this one was the best.",5
1049,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"first things first- i do believe this app helped me a lot with tracking my cycles enabling me to pinpoint ovulation more accurately. (seriously helpful for those of us with irregular cycles & lengths of our cycles.) Therefore it helped me to conceive! I am so thankful for this app. once you become pregnant (if that's your goal) it's SUPER EASY to turn it to ""pregnancy mode"" it's literally the touch of ONE BUTTON. you do not have to down load another app! also forget password is easy to reset!",5
1050,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I don't pay for premium, but I've been using flo for the past couple years or so and have enjoyed it. The period tracker function is intuitive and useful, and I could see being able to track symptoms on a month by month basis could be useful. By far what I like most is that after a few months, it starts to predict when your period will happen again, which helps me to plan better.",5
1051,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I love using Flo as a tracker! since i have PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) it really helps track my menstrual changes, weight and more! it also provides advice for women in general which is an amazing attribute to a tracker app! I've been searching for a good tracker app to help with my condition and i've found it; very reliable, helpful and all out perfect! Thank you Flo!!!!! 😄👍",5
1052,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Makes tracking my PCOS incredibly easy and stress free. I'm no longer scambling and sorting through multiple apps when I'm at the DR. I love how in depth the options are, and how I'm able to track everything I need (and more). Reminders and reports are a nice feature too. And I'm so glad I only need one app instead of 2-3 like before.",5
1053,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Simplistic, convenient, and accessible app for tracking not only the menstrual cycle but ovulation prediction and emotional and physical well-being and symptoms. The AI predictions and reminders seem accurate, for the most part. The ads and information are factual. It wouldn't hurt to have more trauma-informed articles and content free to users on the app. Overall, the user experience is smooth and engaging.",5
1054,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I love this app! It's pretty accurate and I just use it to track my period! I'm sure if I were trying for a baby, it would be just as accurate! Thanks for a great app. Editing: May 2021 (original 11/2019) I will say, I wish we didn't have to pay for majority of the upgraded features. I understand making a profit, etc. It just seems very transactional to me; just trying to track our period or track ovulation.",5
1055,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I have been using this app for years and it has preformed perfectly. The free version is ideal for tracking periods, cycles and symptoms. The premium plan is great for women who are trying to get pregnant, already are pregnant and for women with irregular cycles. I really love all the 'insights' they are articles filled with easy to digest information about the female body and reproductive cycle and organs. I would give this app 10 stars if I could!",5
1056,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Very good app, it predicts my cycle pretty well, and the cycle duration part is cool so I can see how long my cycle usually is. The ads are a little annoying but it's very easy to just ignore them, and I've found that it's more user-friendly than Clue. I also don't look at the insights or much of the premium content at all, I only use it for cycle tracking and it's very good for that! Edit: I get appropriate notifications just fine",5
1057,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The app has helped me alot. It's improved over time. It's easy to use and very helpful. i love insights as well. But,if you have an account and want to sync it with another device under the same email, it doesn't update at all. and its soooooo frustrating... However, the Flo team has been helpful in making it work.",5
1058,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I love this app! I don't have premium and I agree if I did I might be able to track other things and see graphs and that stuff, but It has still really been helpful for tracking my cycles and helping have a better understanding of my body with the articles and insights it gives. I also agree that there is a large amount of adds that I don't need, but other than that it works really well for me and I recommend giving it a try!",5
1059,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I have been using this app for years now and what I love the most about it other than its accurate customization to my periods, is how much new things I have learned from the insights! I've actually continued using this app after changing to another phone twice because it saves your data. Unlike the app I used when I was a teen that didn't save my data or change it's predictions to my slightly irregular periods. Flo is amazingly accurate and informative!",5
1060,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app has been extremely helpful and includes a lot, even in the free version! It has helped me track and become aware of all aspects of my cycle, and I really like the daily symptom predictions. They're not always 100% accurate, but they are often helpful. There is also a lot of useful general information and articles, and I appreciate the overall tone. I absolutely recommend trying Flo!",5
1061,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This has been the one and only app that I've used to track my cycle. The basic version is perfect for just knowing when your next period is. And the premium helps you look deeper into your cycle, what might be the cause for abnormalities in your cycle, and how to work with your body instead of against it. I really recommend this app for people either just looking to see when's the safest time to have fun with a partner, looking to prepare for their period instead of letting it pop up, or more!",5
1062,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I love this app. a lot. however, I want to sign in to my account but there's no option for that. it's only to register or to log out. I've tried entering what i thought was my password and all but all it says is that my email is already registered and in use. I tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling but now I've lost all my data and it still won't work. Flo, please fix this somehow. it's very frustrating. everything else about the app is wonderful just this one thing is really bothering me.",5
1063,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I've had this app for at least two years. At first I didn't pay for it I just liked that it tracked my period because I forget and stress myself out. Eventually I started liking the tips but never paid for the extra features. But I have been paying for at least six months and I actually check it everyday and I love how it's catered to me. I am healthier because of how well it helped me stay on track. Basically yes it's worth it,5
1064,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I love the reminder opinion. I have a hard time keeping myself in line, especially with taking meds. I set alarms, but with this extra step to log in that I actually took my meds has helped a lot. Now I know it's mostly about tracking your cycle, but if it had the option to help me log in other tasks like doing laundry or dishes then i could really help keep myself in line, lol. 😆",5
1065,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I have been using this app for years. I've only used the pro version during a trial & it had even more insights and advice. Overall, this app is the most accurate & easy to understand when it comes to tracking your cycle. Whether you are trying to conceive or not, or if you're tracking your cycle for other reasons (including but not limited to: symptoms, feelings/moods etc...) It is absolutely the best.",5
1066,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've been using this app for about 4 years and really like it. It was really accurate and helped me conceive my first child, fingers crossed on a second. It's also super helpful with tracking your cycle and symptoms and helps identify trends. There are helpful articles and even simple workouts you can go through. So much more than a period tracker. I've used both the paid and free versions and am super happy with the quality of both! 10/10 would recommend",5
1067,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Overall is a great app to track your period. I do enjoy using the app! It's pretty accurate every month! Very easy to use for me anyways! I do hate that you have to pay for the premium..seem like everyone should worthy of this! It is really pricey too. But I am going to try I get it next month because I do enjoy what you can do with the premium plan!,5
1068,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I love it! It helped so much in getting pregnant & following my cycle. I was taking clearblu ovulation tests with it, it was spot on most of the time. Once your in baby mode it goes into what your feeling every month and with what the baby looks like. Really liked the pregnancy features!! Super glad I used it for my period and my pregnancy. I had 2 miscarriages and was in a bad place. Once I was able to get pregnant I was able to count the days back giving me a more accurate time of weeks along.",5
1069,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Sooo good!! I used Pink Pad for YEARS and when I switched phones, I lost all my data. Flo is soo much better. They give you reminders when your period is about to start, they have interesting facts related to women's health and the accuracy of the period predictor is amazing--as long as you log your period when it starts. I can't say enough good things about this app. AND I've switched my phone twice since using it and I have had zero issues getting my data back!",5
1070,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"It's a really good health app for women. I'm 24 and honestly never kept track of my period... Just felt the cramps a-coming and I knew. But not only does this app keep track of it, but it helps me holistically be a healthier me. It has tips from medical professionals about physical health and mental health ad well. I really like that inclusivity in an app.",5
1071,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"so far, this app is very useful. I'm using the Bellabeat Leaf as my fitness tracker (unfortunately not compatible w/ Flo yet), and i can adjust my period time, but not my ovulation time. Flo is super-easy to adjust period/ovulation time, and it's predictions are pretty accurate. the only ""suggestion"" i have is when you log more than 3 symptoms, it'll display in 2 rows, or have like an ""arrow"" (indicator) that'll tell me i have more symptoms logged.",5
1072,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Flo keeps thing simple, with a user friendly interface, a clear picture on how your period is going, and better still, the app reforms itself when ""pregnancy"" is noted, and weekly progress is clear and concise. You won't be overloaded with articles to read, but they are there to satisfy daily curiousity. I highly recommend paying for premium for more advanced period details or pregnancy information. The health profile helps immensely when going to the doctor!",5
1073,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've been using this app for a few years now. It is both very easy to use, and accurate. Having a reminder on my phone a week before hand is helpful. I don't have to try and remember dates. Lots of helpful tips, and information based off what you log about your experience and body. I've opened the app to recall dates to my Dr. Multiple times. Lots of tools you can use to log and monitor your health. I would absolutely recommend .",5
1074,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Very helpful for basic tracking of my period and ovulation. Always accurate! I have pretty irregular periods and after the first 3 or 4 months it pinpointed exactly when I would have my period and it has been consistently correct. I definitely think that the premium features are worth paying for if you're tracking your pregnancy. For a free app it is 100% worth the download, even without the premium stuff.",5
1075,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Helped me get pregnant! We tried to get pregnant for a few months unsuccessfully, but this app helped us easily streamline our efforts and did all the heavy lifting for us, eliminating the guesswork. I love that it adjusts it's estimations based on a wide variety of symptoms my body has every day. Much better than previous app I used.",5
1076,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Best period tracking app out there. There's secret chats where you can anonymously talk about your problems and you'll get support, there's a button to click ""get pregnant"" and it will then give you tips on how to get pregnant, and there's even an option to track your pregnancy. This app is amazing and it offers so much. I've never seen another period app like it.",5
1077,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Best and most accurate period tracker I've ever used. I have had it installed for over 3 years. Every female I meet, once our conversation leans towards periods and tracking, I introduce them to flo. Nobody has ever gone back after installing. I just wish there was no charge for premium content, it's my health information anyway. But, good app nonetheless.",5
1078,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"-- old review -- I really like the app, so I decided to buy the premium version. After that, I did the log-in creating an account and all the stories and articles disappeared! Now I can't see anything except the calendar! Please fix this bug otherwise there is no point in buying the premium version if the app works better when it's free and without logging in :( -- new review -- Flo support helped me solved the problem! Thank you!! Love the app and the service",5
1079,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I love this app!! You can connect with girls all over the world about your health, mind, and body. There are professionals who write articles everyday for girls if they are confused about something or want more information, and of course the period tracker is amazing as well. It tracks my period reliably as well as other symptoms. Whether you know a lot about your period, a little, or barely anything, this is the app for you. I highly recommend this app, so try it out!",5
1080,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app is amazing! For my last two cycles I tested a few menstrual trackers and Flo is by far the best. Their tracking was accurate to the day for two months. The interface is easy to use and not overly feminine, but fresh. My favorite part of the app are the amazing articles that are featured through different parts of your cycle. They are to the point but very educational, backed with real statistics from Flo users. They even have guided yoga routines for menstrual and ovulation cramps! <3",5
1081,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Only use the free version. It's accurate at tracking my flow and has great symptom icons that make it quick and easy to track everything from blood flow to symptoms, sex, and exercise. Recommend signing up with your information because you can go back and check things which is really helpful when you need to review for medical information.",5
1082,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,I really like the app a lot. Just having issues with signing up for premium. Evertime I hit the premium sign up button it said I need to log into my Google account...which I am seeing as how I was able to download the app. But then when I click that button it sends me to the app page on the google store. You'd have another premium account if only it was accessible. Otherwise great app.,5
1083,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I love Flo because it helps me keep track of my past periods while predicting my future cycles. It's an easy and smooth app to move through. It offers so much more than period tracking. There's a secret chat section where you can anonymously talk about anything. It helps keep track of your pregnancy, your health goals (sleep more, gain or lose weight). There's also a premium version (optional) to get more personalized insight into your cycle and what your body feels during the cycle.",5
1084,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"this app has lots of helpful festures and helps me keep track of the way that my body signals the beginning, middle, and ending if a cycle. they even have cool factors like graphs, insights based on the activity you log quizzes, helpful tips, and it even lets you log symptoms, activity, food, and water and can track your steps. this app is great for young girls who have just started their cycle or people looking to plan a pregnancy based on ovulation.",5
1085,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app is amazing! It gives amazing and useful insights! It gives tons of amazing little reminders for some many things like Ovulation day, When to take pills, When your period will start, and so much more! The reminders will also automatically adjust to Day Light Savings Time! The app is also amazingly accurate (as long as you enter as often as possibly like your mood through the day and how you're feeling through the day) I highly recommend this app!",5
1086,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The ONLY period tracker that was ever accurate for me. However most importantly, it helped me calculate my ovulation cycle and with that, I was able to get pregnant! Before using this app, it was definitely a little difficult trying for a baby but now that's not the case. It's honestly the perfect app for your personal health and to track your pregnancy 💙",5
1087,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app has changed my life.It teaches you about your period cycles, and everything makes a lot more sense. The more you use the app, the less you ""need"" it because you start to learn your bodies signs ahead of time, and the app just helps for confirmation at that point - I absolutely think the people behind this app truly care about women's health. It's customizable to your specific needs and it has all around amazing features and is extremely well designed.",5
1088,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This app is very insightful and helpful in keeping track of your cycle as well as so many more details I never realized were important to monitor. It provides informative articles relating to symptoms I experience which I record in the app and I have learned so much more about how my body works around my cycle and other female related topics. Their interface and design is really clean, great graphics and animations. I'm so glad I stumbled across this app, it's been extremely useful to me.",5
1089,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"This is a really helpful app, I find that the educational tools and resources are amazing, easy to use, and easy to understand. I really like how the educational portions speak to you in a conversation format versus an instructor to student format, it's really engaging and seems much more personal. I'm learning more about my own body than I ever knew before!",5
1090,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Love this app! The reminder to log my symptoms every day really helps keep track of anything weird going on with me. The notes app is helpful, I use it as a mini mental health journal as well so all my information is in one spot. One thing I wish it had is a section for any other types of medications you may take or emergency contraceptives. Otherwise, great app!",5
1091,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"App is easy to use, wonderful tracker if your trying to get pregnant, trying NOT to get pregnant, or simply just wanting to track your period.! Also the information they offer is GREAT. I just wish they had more to offer on the premium option, Instead of having to pay $15 for a subscription, though I think if I remember correctly it's only $15 a year, but that's over $1.00 a month just to track your period (if that's all your doing) 🤷🏼‍♀️",5
1092,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,Love this app. I have epilepsy and being able to keep notes and track my cycle in relation to my episodes has been extremely helpful. This app is a great tool for overall health improvement and I 100% recommend it. The only down side to the app is all the ads you have to go through to log your symptoms especially when you're short on time or have a poor memory like mine (sometimes I forget what I was trying to take note of).,5
1093,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've been using Flo for almost 2 years now and I love this app. Always predicts my periods on time if not by a day or two. I also like the little facts and surveys. Really helpful for the younger ladies and sometimes I learn something new too. I also recommend the app to a friend who was having a hard time getting pregnant and three months later they got a positive test. Best app ever!! Highly recommend it! Great way to keep track of your ""lady health"".",5
1094,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I really like this app, it's so helpful and helps me out in so many ways. I've never not used this app for something, like remembering my period times, getting advice, etc. I love the privacy they have on at all times as well. My one critique would be the wallpaper-i used to have a nice galaxy background that was more mellow and my style. Now the wallpapers are pastel basic girl/mom pics or blank (I'm on the pregnancy tracker). I wish it catered to everyone, not just barbie housewives.",5
1095,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"wow. I've never tracked my period in my life, but my husband and I recently decided to start trying for a baby (I'm 24). I love this app! Something that would really make this app great, is to add a place where you can add physical health issues and the app can customize itself a bit more. I have type 1 diabetes and hashimotos disease, so my cycle and pregnancy are very different for me.",5
1096,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"Super simple, effective, and fun!!! Been using this as a period tracker for... Idk how many years, maybe 4? It's gotten some great updates over the years, with more symptoms to log and other features that I don't personally use but would be great for women who are pregnant or trying to get pregnant. If all you use it for is logging the cycle (aka not logging symptoms, just logging period flow), it's still effective and reliable and doesn't bother you about adding things you don't want to add.",5
1097,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"I've been using this app for more than a year now, and I love the layout and the chatrooms, and the calendar is so helpful hOWEVERR it seems like with every update the app gets more aggressive with their ads. First it was just a reminder, then ""giving tips"" until the very end when they say it's only available for premium members, and now they even have timed ads when you have to wait 15+ seconds. Every time I open the ad there's another pop up lately. Seriously considering moving my logs",5
1098,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,The app is fairly accurate if you input the right information to begging with. I just wish that there were more options I feel the more information you can put on the more accurate it would be. I look forward new upgrades. As right it is now it's basic. As it is you need three to five months of accurately registering your cycle to get to see the results.,5
1099,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,"The free version has everything I need in terms of tracking my cycle and is very accurate (although my cycle is quite regular anyway). It also provides information on the lengths of all previous cycles so you can monitor changes over time. There are also frequently deals on the premium version, which make it pretty affordable for a yearly subscription. I have not felt the need to do this though.",5
1100,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,This is a good app really my period and the prediction date never miss it's always as predicted,5
1101,org.iggymedia.periodtracker,This app is good for people that want to track their mensis,5

I am I think in those extreme cases that have the worst periods, yes I drew the short stick. So flo gives me a heads up, i stock up on the essential and don't mentally exhaust myself wondering when will the attack come. It takes some time for it to get your predictions right, bro even I couldn't predict my cycle so no judgement there. After a while if flo says it's due it's true.",5

1200,io.yuka.android,"I went on here to look at some products I already owned and was disappointed with the utter lack of options available to me. The search feature (a very simple and common feature, in my opinion) is behind a $10 paywall, and you can't access certain products without ""inviting a friend"" (what is this 2015?). Personally, I got zero use out of this app due to how little is available to someone who has just downloaded it.",1
1201,io.yuka.android,"In case anyone needed reminding, while this concept is really cool and makes it easy to find products you may not have thought of, different things work for different people. Also, ingredients that are at the bottom of the list are almost inactive and therefore don't mean much if it's 'bad'. If you have chronic allergies, this app works well for you because it flags anything that has ANY kind of irritant. Do your own research as well. Don't let TikTok fool you into taking this app too seriously.",1
1202,io.yuka.android,"This app is fraud, it's so bad. I went around and scanned every salon products i could find and apparently they all failed. All the suggestions are cheap grocery store products, some of which have been publicly outed as having carzenigenic ingredients that make you hair fall out (all Unilever products). Then of course when you poke around it's all part of the ""algarithim"" seems bought to me. People seem to like it tho so this review will get barried unfortunately. The app idea is awesome tho.",1
1203,io.yuka.android,"GREAT concept, but way too many errors. Info is not reliable. The first two times I checked for recommended alternatives the calorie count was completely off, by a HUGE margin, i.e. 100g of almonds with 170 calories and that happened with at least two different types of almonds that were recommended. Then there were little cakes recommended with a serving size of almost 300g at only 200 calories. They really have almost 1,500 calories. Product info should be checked before publishing.",1
1204,io.yuka.android,Won't rate food (gives me an error when I try -- even though food is in the app title) and can't use the search option unless I pay. I have an Android. My friends with iPhones get all this for free. Sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen. Edit: let me be even more clear b/c of Yuka's response to my rating: my friends with iphones HAVE NOT SUBSCRIBED. I have literal screenshots proving everything I've said.,1
1205,io.yuka.android,Need to add a filter for 100/100 scores only. Looking at all the cosmetics and a lot of them saying 'fragance' cause the company won't list what it actually is. 'fragance' can fall under 100 different names. That still is shady business practice to not reveal it and I don't trust it.,1
1206,io.yuka.android,"Was a great app but it nó longer works at all on my Pixel 8. I reinstalled and rebooted 2 times. There is a message at the bottom of the login screen, slide to continue, but this doesn't work at all. Tried on another Pixel 8 and same problem. A shame",1
1207,io.yuka.android,App data is useless since 2 products of the same thing had different rankings just because they had different serving sizes. The products are the same Just different brands. Sucks that the data is worthless,1
1208,io.yuka.android,"When I go to search an item it immediately says ""no results"" even if it's an item that is listed in the top products section & definitely in the app. Waste of money to upgrade unfortunately :(",1
1209,io.yuka.android,"This app is a complete joke. It is not based on science, but on anecdotal evidence. It does not take into account the quantity of an additive.

Regardless of the product, it fails to provide suggestions, diminishing its usefulness. Even though it claims no recommendations were found, I know it's not true since I've received valid suggestions for the same products in the older versions of the app.",1

I wanted to search face creams but it says I'll have to get a premium membership just to do that. Then there's categories that are locked unless I invite a friend. I also had to connect my Facebook account to the app to get any access at all. I will be removing access and uninstalling. There has to be a better way to get this info.",1
1217,io.yuka.android,Completely frustrated! I scanned a bottle of Cetaphil lotion 5 months ago. This app rated it 86/100 so I bought it thinking it was better than what I was currently using.

It's ridiculous that this app fails you like that on expensive items.,1

1223,io.yuka.android,"Nope don'trust this app. Two almost identical products(only flavour different) ended in the two opposite ends of their scale(good and poor). Depending on how much you detail ingredients, it's very easy to fool the rating. Also,the scale is fundamentally wrong. 10% sugar in the diet isn't healthy. That's an outdated view. Plus no sign of taking glycaemic index into consideration? When adding an ""unknown"" product the camera wouldn't focus, it's impossible to take a non-blurry photo.",1

1229,io.yuka.android,"There is just no way this app is not paid by certain brands to boost their number rating, as an esthetician I am alarmed that it will only suggest skincare products that cause just as much harm as products that rank low ""to their standards"" instead of showing products from brands that definitely rank higher ""to their standards"" than the products they suggest Reply to my review: what you are saying do not align with what I am seeing",1
1230,io.yuka.android,"Deleted app after basic errors. The little nutritional labels on the products did not match to what this app claimed. For example, calories, salt content, etc., were all grossly incorrect (sometimes by an order of magnitude). The alternative suggestions were often quite suspect- kraft bbq sauce as a ""better alternative"" to horseradish. Bottomline: the information is of unreliable quality and therefore useless when trying to make health decisions.",1

Currently, this app is a waste of time.",1
1232,io.yuka.android,"Since the app requires you to sign up, either by email or Facebook, it's not for me. Since the reason stated previously for this is just so you can have a history,it seems illogical to me that there can't be an option to continue without signing in unless there really is some more data capture going on behind the scenes. What a shame.",1
1233,io.yuka.android,"100% inaccurate, you're telling me that a monster energy drink has a 39/100 rating, but a black coffee that is fresh brewed has a 0/100. I will bet my left arm and leg that the coffee is way better for you than that energy drink. It honestly looks like companies pay out the Developer and if they don't they get a bad rating. Clearly shady practices going on and all they want is money, even if they have to decieve you.",1
1234,io.yuka.android,"It is a great concept but this one lacks of INTEGRITY. Anyone can modify the nutrition facts and ingredients of any product. I found products where the nutrition facts and ingredients are incorrect or incomplete, and for that this app gives them false grades. Like anyone else, I can update the nutrition facts and ingredients in the app, but brands constantly modify their products with healthy ingredients, and this app doesn't update them automatically. Nice try!",1
1235,io.yuka.android,I had high hopes but quickly realized that the ranking system lacks the ability to understand the context that quantity plays for things like additives. Seems to go against the bulk of scientific literature on things like artificial sweeteners. Also i was recieving emails for health tips that ultamitely just seemed like the creators are pushing a certain diet narrative that doesn't align with the BULK of the scientific literature. I would take the ranking scores with with a grain of salt,1
1236,io.yuka.android,Had to uninstall after being recommended an alternative product with a rating of 100/100 but when I inputted it into a cosmetic ingredient checker site it wasn't great. So I decided to compare the ingredient list I found on the official site to yuka and it was so off! Good concept but their database is completely off. Maybe if they let people actually input the ingredients it would be more accurate. I will be downloading an alternative app though.,1
1237,io.yuka.android,App won't open...I've installed and un installed...does not work. Let me know when this is fixed.,1

1240,io.yuka.android,After scanning two food items I'm already not a fan of this app. I wish it compared things like Vitamin content as well. I thought this would be like the website cosDNA which lists all the ingredients and then highlights which are harmful based on research. The only scenario where this app seems beneficial is if you have diabetes or high blood pressure. A low calorie/low sugar/low sodium diet is not the answer for everyone.,1
1241,io.yuka.android,"Already started wrong, im trying to eat healthier so obviously i consume protein bars as snacks etc and I gues the app does not rate dietary supplements so what good is it then. We all know vegetables, fruits snd whole foods are good and preserved meats and processed is bad. We want to catch the sneaky ones the ones they tell us help us but maybe don't, like dietary supplements. Fix it please",1
1242,io.yuka.android,"DOES NOT WORK. I downloaded it and i get the welcome green screen which says, slide to start. I slide and get the orange screen. Nothing works on the orange screen. No directions what so ever. Was recommended this by a friend and looked forward to the data. Reading the reviews there seems to be a lot of bugs, many different software versions and bad data. You might need a few months of development then release a single version that works for everyone. I'm deleting it. Thanks.",1
1243,io.yuka.android,This app while easy-to-use is very unhelpful. Counting calories and salt do not make sense anymore especially while ignoring other horribly harmful ingredients like vegetable oils. We purchased good seed bread because of an 100% excellent review only two find out there is almost a whole tablespoon of sugar in only two slices. Hope you can fix these problems so you can help people instead of hurting them like you are now.,1
1244,io.yuka.android,"I rely on this app to provide accurate readings on the products that my family and I purchase. Unfortunately, this has not been the case. Over the past year, I purchased a sunscreen multiple times based on its green(excellent) rating,only to realize that it has now changed its rating to bad. I am so disappointed. I loved using this app, but I am now reluctant based on this experience.",1
1245,io.yuka.android,Keep finding stats wrong! Even when taking new photo to correct error it mixes up 100g stats with 30g etc. This means you can not trust anything on app defeating the purpose! The stats must be correct 100% for this to work.,1
1246,io.yuka.android,"Skincare fanatics; this app is not for you. The app rates cosmetics based on the 'potential risk' of certain ingredients, but in a complete biased opinion. I came across many bad skincare products filled with denatured alcohol and perfume high on the ingredient list that got a 100/100 rating.. Please revise your idea of 'good' and 'bad' please!",1
1247,io.yuka.android,"This app could be great but the data is very often not accurate and they never compare the products on the same base. 2 products with exact same content can have a very different rating. The idea is great but if the data stays in accurate like this, it is not useful.",1

1250,io.yuka.android,Lol. Pay what you want only gives you three price choices. Yearly membership? Ridiculous. Offline scanning is a premium feature. But don't worry. They'll definitely sell your data. Especially since they require you to sign up with an account to even use the app.,1
1251,io.yuka.android,"There's no point of reference for what's being scanned or how it's rated in comparison to individual body needs or other foods consumed. My needs (4'10f) are different than a 6ft male. I scanned a 2 ingredient, organic product that was excellent in 5 categories, but because its considered high in calories (200) and fat (2g) it was scored 38. Need to be able to look at the whole picture and customize. If a person has a naturally low fat diet, it can still be a great option. Needs tons of work",1
1252,io.yuka.android,Don't waste your time with this app. 95% of the products I scanned were not in their system. I really don't want to have to add everything I scan to be registered. I understand not all products will be in the system but out of the 18 things I scanned only actually came up. Frustrating.,1
1253,io.yuka.android,"this doesn't rate things appropriately. it seems to rate purely based on # of ingredients and not necessarily if theyre good or bad. one item with 33 inactive green dot will have a ""poor"" rating while another w 2 moderate ingredients will have a ""good"" rating. Don't need to go to your website to ""see how it works"" when I've used it. Just do your own research bc half the ratings here are just bc there's more than one or two ingredients.",1
1254,io.yuka.android,Waste of my valuable time. The first item was a tea not listed. I performed everything prompted to enter the tea into the system. I got to the nutritional info data entry and it refused to accept the 95 calories provided in the photo I took and in the data listed under nutritional info. The next item prompted that the barcode is not supported. NOT a pleasant experience.,1
1255,io.yuka.android,Auto crop is terrible for taking pictures of the product and nutritional info. Wasn't able to get past adding nutritional info as it stated that there was 3 incorrect values but they where indeed correct as stated on the package. Could get past that part to add product to registry.,1
1256,io.yuka.android,"This app SUCKS! I was so excited about this app, until I scanned stuff that I know is totally clean. Something is bad because it's got too little cocoa? Something scores 100 of 100 and it has natural flavors? What the hell? I can't use this app anymore. Was excited for a few hours but this app is full of misinformation. How can products with natural flavors score a perfect score? Nothing natural about them! And also ZERO email responses when I emailed them. Four times! 👎",1
1257,io.yuka.android,Warning this app contains incorrect data. A product that contains irritating ingredients or skin sensitizers is automatically considered 'bad'. Confirmed by their comment below. Risk depends on concentration. Below certain concentrations a substance is no longer dangerous. Strict EU cosmetic laws by definition keep harmful products of the market. The fact that the app 'recommends' other products makes it biased and untrustworthy.,1

Would give 0 stars if I could EDIT: yeah I'm not adding 99% of Australian products myself, manually inputting a bunch of tedious info that the app makes 0 effort to skim from the photo of the nutrition info table. I mean unless you want to pay me to do that.",1
1259,io.yuka.android,"Let's play a game shall we? It's called scan an item they recommend as better then the product you scanned. I scanned Olyra's Cinnamon Tahini breakfast biscuits. Yuka said poor and recommended Belvita as a good alternative product, with a good rating. Well I scanned the Belvita I also have and guess what! Bad! So I scan a product they recommend as good and it comes back as bad!? Um biased or doesn't actually know what it's talking about... I'm not sure.",1
1260,io.yuka.android,"Permissions and login Why do I need to create a login via email? I Don't want more spam email. Why so many permissions?

Pretty clear they run analysis on their user data (people who scan this also scan that, people that got suggested this swap have been scanning other products of the suggestion's brand...). If they don't do all of that yet they will. And they'll sell the results of the analysis for $$. Don't be their guinea pig. Refuse mandatory account creation!",1

1401,io.yuka.android,"It was honestly a nice app, but there's a major issue for me. Recently, it just randomly started crashing a lot before I could even scan any items. I tried multiple times, and it kept crashing. Something else I realized is how misleading it is. For example, certain ingredients (one example being Fragrence) is considered a ""Low risk"" or ""No risk"" when it's arguably a higher risk. There are also some ingredients which are actually great that are considered to be ""Hazardous"" or ""Moderate risk"".",2

The issue is that I've used yuka on multiple phones, data, and wifi networks, but it still takes an hour for anything scanned to appear most of the time.

1406,io.yuka.android,"Doesn't work as it should. You scan and it tells you if a product is good or bad, it recommends a safer product when an item is scanned. The problem is when you find the safer product on the shelf and scan it the app says the product has a poor or bad rating. I've also scanned some Atkins items and it says that they don't evaluate supplements?? I've scanned a lot of various ""safe"" products from shampoo to food and they are all poor or bad.

Under the recommendations, I see the same product I just scanned, but now ot has a ""good"" score of 60-70. The stats are the same. Inconsistent. You will have to make your own informed analysis instead of relying on this app to tell you if something is ""good"" or not.",2
1409,io.yuka.android,"Overall, i like the idea, but there are a few red flags. I purchased the premium version thinking i can search for brands without barcodes by name bc they still list the ingredients and adding and searching by name should be a viable option. Second, and it's important, fragrance IS a harmful ingredient. Especially in the United States. Most brands list everything toxic under fragrance, it's a known loophole they use. And seeing that yuka considers it low risk makes them lose their credibility.",2
1410,io.yuka.android,"There are some big downfalls. It highly weighs protein and fiber as big wins, weighs fat as BAD and allows for a lot of sugar and salt before saying it's bad. Not all fat is created equal and it doesn't take that into consideration.

1412,io.yuka.android,Probably one of the most inconsistent apps in the app store. It's fine when it works (emphasis on WHEN). It'll work one day.

1420,io.yuka.android,"Been using YUKA for about a year. Originally thought YUKA was a great app to help us make wise decisions when trying to choose healthier foods. However recently have found inconsistencies when scanning same items of different quantities. Major inconsistencies such as one will score 37 and the other 77. How can that be for the exact same product? Originally thought it was a one off error, but this has happened quite a few times. Hopefully this can be fixed. Makes me doubt all the scores now.",2
1421,io.yuka.android,"Nice idea, unfortunately the scores can be unreliable because of wrong or false info. Example, recommended something with additives over a natural product because whoever added it put that it was organic and had an excellent quantity of fruit, both false, so giving it a higher score than the additive free item. Could be an honest mistake, but could also be manipulation to get a product a higher score than it should have. Didn't notice at first but started seeing more and more instances of this.",2
1422,io.yuka.android,"The app is great in telling me about additives in various products I use. However, I have noticed that the app is sometimes unreliable as the rating of some products continues to fluctuate. Eg. It said a particular product was 0% 2 days ago but also says the exact same product is 100% today! This needs to be worked on to avoid misleading information Secondly, I have repeatedly tried to scan some products that are not already on the app unsuccessfully. The app should be more user-friendly.",2

After it told me animal crackers were better than simple mills products, I'm out. Would be more helpful to break down each ingredient and rate each ingredient.

But I feel like anybody who's truly interested in eating healthy isn't going to learn it from this app.",2
1440,io.yuka.android,"Needs at least some access to dietary restriction filters without premium, especially given what it recommends at times (gummy vitamins for candy?). For instance, most candy will give you stevia sweetened alternatives. Unfortunately I have a 100% record of stevia sending me to the ER. Natural≠safer. People are extremely surprised how refined and processed Stevia is. But the point I'm making is that access to even a single filter would make this app useful. Assuming it has other recommendations.",2
1441,io.yuka.android,"Too many inconsistencies. Quite a few times I've scanned same brand different flavor of products. Flavor A will say too much sugar/sodium and scores low, flavor b will have the same amount of sugar/sodium and scores significantly higher. Happens almost every shopping trip. Most recently Kim nori, sea salt vs Korean bbq and nutrigrain blueberry vs apple. And blueberry had more risky additives than apple.",2
1442,io.yuka.android,"I don't trust this app at all. Why do you give Nature Valley Crunchy Oats and Honey granola bars a ""51,"" a ""good"" rating, yet the Kind Salted Caramel and Chocolate nut bar a rating of ""38"", which is considered poor? Nature Valley foods are genetically modified, but that's ok? Kind foods are not. I guess you are on the payroll of the big companies. Uninstalling.",2
1443,io.yuka.android,Be nice if app would work most time it just scrolls be nice if it would accurately show but scan 2 to 3 times it changes,2
1444,io.yuka.android,This app is conflicting. They post a lot of items that are good that are actually bad. How do you post items are good and it has red 40 blue one and yellow five in them.? Those are carcinogenic dyes. The customer service lied and said Oh that barcode is used for two different items Oh stop lying. It was suggested that I buy a product Then when I scan the product that it suggested it was bad. This app cannot be trusted.,2
1445,io.yuka.android,"My understanding is that MSG has now been shown to be okay in normal quantities, however the citations in the app are not links so hard to know if their ""hazardous"" tag is backed up. Also cannot delete my account which isn't great. Nice interface and good scanning.",2
1446,io.yuka.android,"I think it's pretty clear that the real goal of this app is to get as much information possible about your product spending and use habits. Once you start scanning stuff inside the app, it creates an advertisement profile. It knows what you ate and when and shows a nice graphic to you of percentages of what you ingest. Besides telling you that everything you eat is carcinogenic poison (it's laughable), the data is probably sold off to Facebook especially if you used it to sign in.",2
1447,io.yuka.android,"From the gui and the code side, it's a clean app quick and reads bar code perfectly. From the app itself you will be scanning from hours and will flag red everything. Little sodium? BAD. This is the kind of extremist that ppl end saying f$ it. Must be a middle ground between over expensive, no taste at all food, and a very bad one. I bet you scan all wholefood and 80% will say poor or bad",2
1448,io.yuka.android,"I like the variety of products that the app has information for. Really easy to use. A little confused about the rating scale. For example: in one product 180mg of sodium is bad, but in a similar recommended product 180mg of sodium was really good.",2
1449,io.yuka.android,Can't see. What the app does until you subscribe. I'm looking for an app that I can search or scan products to see if they have milk in them. There doesn't appear to be any way to do this unless you pay a Subscription but I'm reluctant to pay without seeing or knowing if it is possible to do this! Very VERY limited in the free version. A trial of the full app would help immensely!,2
1450,io.yuka.android,"I thought this app may be better than ThinkDirty but it's not. I've scanned 4 things and of those 4 only 1 was already in the library. The other 3 I had to take pictures and so far it's given a wait time of 4 hours.... It took 4 days for the first to come through. Overall though, the app is very easy to use",2
1451,io.yuka.android,"The search feature being a subscription based feature seems extremely inconsiderate to those who are unable to leave the house and use the scan feature on barcodes. Although the fee is small and helps support the app, no one who may be disabled should have to pay to use the search feature. Better to just not have the app all together. Find something user-friendly for all seems to be the better choice.",2
1452,io.yuka.android,"Very bias, fun but not helpful. Listed antioxidants and other very normal minerals that your body needs as hazardous. Only suggested fake meat dishes options for my Atkins protein drink, not really comparable. I have a degree in healthcare. This is not science but preference. Layout is nice though.",2
1453,io.yuka.android,"Everytime I try open the app it gives me the option to log in with Facebook or email and everytime I click either it lags out.

1454,io.yuka.android,"Not worth it. It's a great idea, but poorly executed. Hardly anything is already in their system. A product will show red if there is even a trace of something that may or may not be harmful even when route of exposure to be toxic is not the same as the peoduct,. I.e. (this ingredient) is toxic when ingested in large quantities but the product is a face cream and the ingredient is the last listed.",2
1455,io.yuka.android,"First this app wants you to ""sign up"" by giving it not just your email but your full name. There's no service that comes with that process though. The app is just a user content database with a poorly made proprietary calculator that first relies on users providing accurate information then gets it's calculations wrong regardless. Very easily manipulated, only thing stopping someone entering false information is a super secret promise. Don't waste your time on this junk app.",2
1456,io.yuka.android,"I briefly checked this app against various foods in my pantry and decided I won't be using it for inaccurate ratings. It marks down foods based on caloric count. For example, I have one bag of baked veggies marked ""poor"" 29/100 because It's 220 calories but that's FOR THE WHOLE BAG. It also does not note healthy unsaturated fat at all. The same bag referenced above was 3.5g sat fat but 11.5g unsat fat which should be great. The rating system seems to be very poor.",2
1457,io.yuka.android,"The idea is great, and the realization it's a start, but I think the evaluation is a bit reductive. How much a food good is does not only depend on how much sugar or calories it gives. It's about the quality of the ingredients, the preservatives in it and also the its realization. It's good to show if a food is or isn't organic, but where was it made? By who? Is it fair trade? You're doing a great job, also answering to all the questions and critiques, so these are just tips to get even better",2
1458,io.yuka.android,"Yuka is dramatic and rates products a lot worse than they probably should. It also doesn't take into consideration that even though the beauty product is ""better made"", it's also less effective. It's a great idea, it just might scare users a lot more then it should. To top it off, why on earth do you need an account to use this app? So unnecessary and a privacy concern. Also just another password to forget.",2
1459,io.yuka.android,"First product I scanned, I found the rating to be so stupid, I just cant trust their scoring system. I scanned a few more products. Found it helpful to see what the ""bad"" stuff is. But a score of 6/100 for having *some* *potential* allergens, I would have expected a score that low to be something CANCER causing.... Not allergens. In addition, it lists salicylic acid as something irritating, so doesn't recommend any other alternatives with salicylic acid, when it's a legitimate acne treatment.",2
1460,io.yuka.android,"Was hopeful to try this after Think Dirty was a fail but app is blocked by an email wall. I don't understand companies' rationale for this JUST to look up information. After uninstalling I came back and read some more critical reviews. Others took issue with this as well and Yuka's responses were they use your email to send a newsletter and keep track of user contributions. Ok; if I want to use those services you may have my email then, not before. Will consider trying again when they fix this.",2
1461,io.yuka.android,"I downloaded this app after my friend raved about how it helped her make better choices when buying products. I decided to purchase a membership to take full advantage of this app, but the search option does not work. A waste of money. I should have come to the reviews first, but I see this is actually an ongoing issue.",2

1463,io.yuka.android,"Saturated fat and salt are not dangerous. Your app is based on discredited science. I follow a low carb high fat and protein diet and my most recent bloodwork was better than it has been in 20 years after 4 years following a healthy low carb diet. Please change your ratings so that it can also work for people who do not subscribe to the out of date, discredited, bogus science which demonised saturated fats and salt at the expense of sugar and processed high carb foods.",2
1464,io.yuka.android,"Lack has nearly no information for products in Asian countries. When trying to add new product information, it can't recognize Nutritional information because it can't recognize differences of language such as Indonesian writing. It can recognize western products but some are still missing in their database. Useless for Asian countries.",2
1465,io.yuka.android,"Good idea but recommendations for similar products seem highly BIASED depending on brands. Reply: This is my experience and not only with one product but after seeing this pattern repeatedly, I decided to post my comment. I understand apps developer's reply is genuine, but the matter of fact is that more often than expected one can find different ratings for VERY similar products. I can provide a few examples if needed.",2

1467,io.yuka.android,"I scanned a bottle of shampoo that I accidentally used recently that gave me hives from all the sulfates... this app rated the shampoo as good despite the multiple sulfates in it. The main reason I downloaded the app was to help avoid sulfates in products since I also get anaphylaxis if ingested. Probably going to delete. I like the idea of an app giving you warnings such as high in salt or fat, or cosmetic contains xxx toxin, more as a warning than a judgement of good/bad.",2
1468,io.yuka.android,I had a customer in using this app so I downloaded it to check myself and I have to question the accuracy of it. Items in different sizes were rated different but have same ingredients. A liter size product rated excellent and the retail size rated poor.,2
1469,io.yuka.android,It was absolutely perfect when I installed it but after one week it stopped working and it stopped showing the results but the quality of a app is good. I hope you'll will solve this problem thank you.,2

All the foods that are *good* for me, are rated *bad* on this app. The developers don't seem to have got the memo that Fats are actually healthy, as part of a clean eating plan. And really really bad stuff like coco pops are rated *good* 😱 Go figure! That said, app works well, nice layout, good information on additives, toxins etc. Just need a *Keto Version*, folks! Many thanks 😊",2
1473,io.yuka.android,This app doesn't seem to have a whole lot of Australian foods in the list. Everything asked me to add them to the list. Not the experience I was hoping for. I'll keep it installed for a little bit but most likely will uninstall it if I don't see any improvements.,2
1474,io.yuka.android,"No fat count! I would gladly pay for this app and change my rating if it included fat content. It only shows saturated fat, but the scanner is quick and efficient.",2
1475,io.yuka.android,"Appreciate what this app is trying to do. But genuinely a lot of it is scare mongering on products causing changes to genetics... 😑 Interesting idea, but those who don't have sufficient knowledge of what additives are and how they actually work could be scared off harmless products and food.",2
1476,io.yuka.android,hello. i actually love this app so far. i downloaded it today and it has proven very helpful and informative. the only small issues that i have is that it doesn't come in other languages and you can't scan medication. all these things would prove helpful!! would appreciate it if you guys got back to me 🤗,2
1477,io.yuka.android,"Inconsistent. 2 of the same exact products, different ratings. It scored bad when scanned, but it was used as a suggestion for a bad item and scored good. 🤷🤷🤷",2
1478,io.yuka.android,"Potentially very useful, but their knowledge of ingredient safety and functionality is shaky. They classify sodium bicarbonate as an anti-caking agent, which it is not. It is used as a leavening agent and acid reducer. Plus, their hazard ratings are based on opinion and/or faulty research.",2
1479,io.yuka.android,Checked one product: they had the sodium value wrong by about 1000×. Was interested in the premium version but it was nowhere to be found. I would rate this app higher but my first impression didn't give me anything to rate this higher than 2 stars.,2
1480,io.yuka.android,The app is useful but I have been using it to test my cosmetic products like moisturizer and cleanser and all the ratings have been either poor or bad! I've scanned about 10 products so far and not one has got a higher rating than 'poor'. I'm doubting whether this app is actually accurate because my products have high ratings and are well known brands like Nivea and Sukin. I can't put my trust into this app. :(,2
1481,io.yuka.android,Does not let me log in. Can't get past the first screen. Doesn't let me access settings to see what is wrong. Never had an issue like this with other apps.,2

1483,io.yuka.android,App keeps crashing!! I can't even open it anymore and have a paid subscription. This has been happening for about a week now. Very disappointing.,2
1484,io.yuka.android,"App works well for identifying foods with additives that may be harmful, but does not care about high fructose corn syrup which is terrible for you!

1488,io.yuka.android,It started off great. Then after a view days the camera wouldnt focus. It kept zooming in and wouldnt scan anything.,2
1489,io.yuka.android,I got this because I have skin issues. I thought this could help to vet skin care products. The problem is it is showing everything as bad. Including things my dermatologists have prescribed to me. I will not be using this and re ommend others not use it and just ask a professional.,2
1490,io.yuka.android,Probably useful if you're a junk food addict or don't know how to read labels. I don't know what criteria they use to establish fat or sodium content but saying that cheese is bad due to the fat content is misleading.,2

1492,io.yuka.android,"The cosmetic scores are heavily skewed by the ingredient Phenoxyethanol. With it's presence being in over 90% of cosmetics as an antimicrobial, Yuka lowering these overall scores of products by 60% for it's presence would seem to be a severe misstep from companies. However, multiple scholarly articles show no adverse effects present in exposures under 200x what is seen in any products on the market. Until this is mitigated, my score stays the same",2
1493,io.yuka.android,Said the soy sauce I used had too much sodium then recommended a soy sauce with more sodium. Edit: If the sugar was the reason for the lower score then state the reason for a lower score as more sugar. Both soy sauces received a green rating for sugar.,2

Like stated titanium dioxide as one of the ingridients and product rating is excellent, how it can be excellent if it potential carcirogen?

There are products with harmful additives and higher rating than thise which are much healthier in reality. Not good!",2

1505,io.yuka.android,"Overall, i like the idea, but there are a few red flags. I purchased the premium version thinking i can search for brands without barcodes by name bc they still list the ingredients and adding and searching by name should be a viable option. Second, and it's important, fragrance IS a harmful ingredient. Especially in the United States. Most brands list everything toxic under fragrance, it's a known loophole they use. And seeing that yuka considers it low risk makes them lose their credibility.",2

There are also some ingredients which are actually great that are considered to be ""Hazardous"" or ""Moderate risk"".",2

However, with more use I started to find duplicate product listings - one rated excellent, and the other poor...for the same exact thing. I feel like I've just wasted money on this.",2
1540,io.yuka.android,"Was hopeful to try this after Think Dirty was a fail but app is blocked by an email wall. I don't understand companies' rationale for this JUST to look up information. After uninstalling I came back and read some more critical reviews. Others took issue with this as well and Yuka's responses were they use your email to send a newsletter and keep track of user contributions. Ok; if I want to use those services you may have my email then, not before. Will consider trying again when they fix this.",2

Flavor A will say too much sugar/sodium and scores low, flavor b will have the same amount of sugar/sodium and scores significantly higher. Happens almost every shopping trip. Most recently Kim nori, sea salt vs Korean bbq and nutrigrain blueberry vs apple. And blueberry had more risky additives than apple.",2
1543,io.yuka.android,"I think it's pretty clear that the real goal of this app is to get as much information possible about your product spending and use habits. Once you start scanning stuff inside the app, it creates an advertisement profile. It knows what you ate and when and shows a nice graphic to you of percentages of what you ingest. Besides telling you that everything you eat is carcinogenic poison (it's laughable), the data is probably sold off to Facebook especially if you used it to sign in.",2

1545,io.yuka.android,"Unfortunately, there is no provision for people on a Keto diet. All the foods that are *good* for me, are rated *bad* on this app. The developers don't seem to have got the memo that Fats are actually healthy, as part of a clean eating plan. And really really bad stuff like coco pops are rated *good* 😱 Go figure! That said, app works well, nice layout, good information on additives, toxins etc. Just need a *Keto Version*, folks! Many thanks 😊",2
1546,io.yuka.android,"Potentially very useful, but their knowledge of ingredient safety and functionality is shaky. They classify sodium bicarbonate as an anti-caking agent, which it is not. It is used as a leavening agent and acid reducer. Plus, their hazard ratings are based on opinion and/or faulty research.",2
1547,io.yuka.android,"My understanding is that MSG has now been shown to be okay in normal quantities, however the citations in the app are not links so hard to know if their ""hazardous"" tag is backed up. Also cannot delete my account which isn't great. Nice interface and good scanning.",2
1548,io.yuka.android,"From the gui and the code side, it's a clean app quick and reads bar code perfectly. From the app itself you will be scanning from hours and will flag red everything. Little sodium? BAD. This is the kind of extremist that ppl end saying f$ it. Must be a middle ground between over expensive, no taste at all food, and a very bad one. I bet you scan all wholefood and 80% will say poor or bad",2
1549,io.yuka.android,This app is conflicting. They post a lot of items that are good that are actually bad. How do you post items are good and it has red 40 blue one and yellow five in them.? Those are carcinogenic dyes. The customer service lied and said Oh that barcode is used for two different items Oh stop lying. It was suggested that I buy a product Then when I scan the product that it suggested it was bad. This app cannot be trusted.,2
1550,io.yuka.android,"Been using YUKA for about a year. Originally thought YUKA was a great app to help us make wise decisions when trying to choose healthier foods. However recently have found inconsistencies when scanning same items of different quantities. Major inconsistencies such as one will score 37 and the other 77. How can that be for the exact same product? Originally thought it was a one off error, but this has happened quite a few times. Hopefully this can be fixed. Makes me doubt all the scores now.",2
1551,io.yuka.android,"I briefly checked this app against various foods in my pantry and decided I won't be using it for inaccurate ratings. It marks down foods based on caloric count. For example, I have one bag of baked veggies marked ""poor"" 29/100 because It's 220 calories but that's FOR THE WHOLE BAG. It also does not note healthy unsaturated fat at all. The same bag referenced above was 3.5g sat fat but 11.5g unsat fat which should be great. The rating system seems to be very poor.",2
1552,io.yuka.android,"Lack has nearly no information for products in Asian countries.

For instance, most candy will give you stevia sweetened alternatives. Unfortunately I have a 100% record of stevia sending me to the ER. Natural≠safer. People are extremely surprised how refined and processed Stevia is. But the point I'm making is that access to even a single filter would make this app useful.

One of the ingredients was butoxy peg-4 pg-amodimethicone. While this ingredient itself isn't dangerous, part of the process to make it involves ethylene oxide which can be very dangerous(I am not a chemist).

The main reason I downloaded the app was to help avoid sulfates in products since I also get anaphylaxis if ingested. Probably going to delete. I like the idea of an app giving you warnings such as high in salt or fat, or cosmetic contains xxx toxin, more as a warning than a judgement of good/bad.",2
1564,io.yuka.android,The idea of this app is good. This app is paid for by someone and I don't think you can trust what is says.,2

1566,io.yuka.android,Really good but not enough good explanation for why it was a bad product so deleted it.,2
1567,io.yuka.android,"The cosmetic scores are heavily skewed by the ingredient Phenoxyethanol. With it's presence being in over 90% of cosmetics as an antimicrobial, Yuka lowering these overall scores of products by 60% for it's presence would seem to be a severe misstep from companies. However, multiple scholarly articles show no adverse effects present in exposures under 200x what is seen in any products on the market. Until this is mitigated, my score stays the same",2
1568,io.yuka.android,"It could be a very good app but unfortunately it has lots of false information! Like stated titanium dioxide as one of the ingridients and product rating is excellent, how it can be excellent if it potential carcirogen? Many toothpastes contain sodium fluoride, SLS which both are very harmful and stated no risk, so... There are products with harmful additives and higher rating than thise which are much healthier in reality. Not good!",2

I'm not paying to use a search function.",2

1581,io.yuka.android,I got this because I have skin issues. I thought this could help to vet skin care products. The problem is it is showing everything as bad. Including things my dermatologists have prescribed to me. I will not be using this and re ommend others not use it and just ask a professional.,2
1582,io.yuka.android,It's a good idea for an app. But any app that begins with asking for my Facebook account info in order to begin is getting uninstalled ...,2
1583,io.yuka.android,Probably useful if you're a junk food addict or don't know how to read labels. I don't know what criteria they use to establish fat or sodium content but saying that cheese is bad due to the fat content is misleading.,2
1584,io.yuka.android,"This app thinks Msg is hazardous, even though there's no definitive consensus in the scientific community to show that and a huge portion of the world's population consumes it regularly with no issues. That's just one I happen to know. I can only imagine what else this app has gotten wrong.",2
1585,io.yuka.android,A subscription just to use the search feature? I've never uninstalled something so fast.,2
1586,io.yuka.android,"First product I scanned, I found the rating to be so stupid, I just cant trust their scoring system. I scanned a few more products. Found it helpful to see what the ""bad"" stuff is. But a score of 6/100 for having *some* *potential* allergens, I would have expected a score that low to be something CANCER causing.... Not allergens. In addition, it lists salicylic acid as something irritating, so doesn't recommend any other alternatives with salicylic acid, when it's a legitimate acne treatment.",2
1587,io.yuka.android,"Saturated fat in butter, sour cream is bad for you.. Reallly? Very basic app, same info as on labels",2

1589,io.yuka.android,"Yuka is dramatic and rates products a lot worse than they probably should. It also doesn't take into consideration that even though the beauty product is ""better made"", it's also less effective. It's a great idea, it just might scare users a lot more then it should. To top it off, why on earth do you need an account to use this app? So unnecessary and a privacy concern. Also just another password to forget.",2
1590,io.yuka.android,"I scanned a few items that were rated excellent, bought them and then went back to the app after a few months and they were rated poor or bad. Not sure how they got downgraded just like that.",2
1591,io.yuka.android,"A decent app, very interesting idea that I'd love to see done more efficiently. I submitted a problem as the ingredients on a product were wrong, and when it said it had 'updated' I checked to see that it hadn't actually updated at all, and the incorrect ingredients were not removed. Dissapointing.",2
1592,io.yuka.android,It was absolutely perfect when I installed it but after one week it stopped working and it stopped showing the results but the quality of a app is good. I hope you'll will solve this problem thank you.,2
1593,io.yuka.android,Doggie 5th 5,2
1594,io.yuka.android,"Doesn't work as it should. You scan and it tells you if a product is good or bad, it recommends a safer product when an item is scanned. The problem is when you find the safer product on the shelf and scan it the app says the product has a poor or bad rating. I've also scanned some Atkins items and it says that they don't evaluate supplements?? I've scanned a lot of various ""safe"" products from shampoo to food and they are all poor or bad. The only thing I like is that it's easy to use",2
1595,io.yuka.android,Why do I need to use my fb or Gmail log in to use the app? I should be able to create a unique ID. I don't know you. Deleted the app. No thanks,2
1596,io.yuka.android,"Appreciate what this app is trying to do. But genuinely a lot of it is scare mongering on products causing changes to genetics... 😑 Interesting idea, but those who don't have sufficient knowledge of what additives are and how they actually work could be scared off harmless products and food.",2
1597,io.yuka.android,"Always crashes and never opens. I'm a paying member because i love this app but whenever i try use it, it crashes.",2
1598,io.yuka.android,"Sadly you need to sign up straight away, I want to try it before I give you my email address etc. Uninstalled before I even got to scan an item :(",2
1599,io.yuka.android,"The search feature being a subscription based feature seems extremely inconsiderate to those who are unable to leave the house and use the scan feature on barcodes. Although the fee is small and helps support the app, no one who may be disabled should have to pay to use the search feature. Better to just not have the app all together. Find something user-friendly for all seems to be the better choice.",2
1600,io.yuka.android,"Works fast. Nice and simple UI. The app is only really good for checking additives. It doesn't make everything I've done research into and know is bad. Their ratings follow a one-size-fits-all model which isn't really accurate as everyone has different needs in their diet. Overall though, it serves as a good starting point for a healthier life.",3
1601,io.yuka.android,"Half good, half bad. I've bought items on the app that came up as excellent, only to scan again a few days later and they suddenly have a rating of bad, same bottles, same ingredients, no idea why the change and having to waste money. Other main issue is after paying for the search services, more than half the time it doesn't work. You enter the name, hit search and nothing happens. Again total waste of money. I am learning the names of the ""bad"" ingredients, I suppose that's helpful.",3
1602,io.yuka.android,"This app is convenient for looking up and learning ingredients to avoid allergies, but the ratings are so unreliable. It mind blows me how they would rate a makeup product ""poor"" just from having a single essential preservative. They don't take into account the dose. Also some foreign products are rated ""good"" when the ingredient list isn't even complete. It's like all the database is manually updated by users, and reviewed by robots.",3
1603,io.yuka.android,"For the most part I really like this app, but until it stops working so inconsistently I will not be paying for the full features. I can usually get five scans out of it before the app goes offline and won't respond. Wifi and full service doesn't matter and it won't work again until I've force quit it half a dozen times. Really adds a lot of time to grocery shopping. Another feature I'm hoping to see added is identification of seed oils. Right now it still shows those foods as good options.",3
1604,io.yuka.android,"This app is very inconsistent when you use the search feature. I looked up an inkey list product and got mixed results. One said it was excellent and others said it was bad. For a paid experience I expected more. Maybe I am using it wrong. Also, there A LOT of main stream products that do not show up in the search feature which is the main reason I went on and paid for premium version. Overall, I am pretty disappointed that I spend the money.",3
1605,io.yuka.android,"Great concept, execution could be improved. The scanner is very unreliable. It doesn't know if the picture is in focus or within a good distance, and it doesn't have an UI for me to help out. You'd need a lot of free time and patience standing in the grocery store trying to scan products correctly. At which point just Googling the product is faster. Also doesn't seem to work for non-american products.",3
1606,io.yuka.android,"I don't like that it takes points off for food that has ""too many calories"". That's subjective and dependent on the person who is eating the food. 100 calories for some orange juice should not deduct THAT many points. I do, however, like using this for cosmetic products. It's very helpful because I don't know the technical names for many of the harsh or toxic chemicals in a lot of hair and skin care items. I also like how in depth it goes in describing why the ingredients are bad for you :)",3
1607,io.yuka.android,Helpful with most products I own so far but there are some that are not in the app. I have scanned and added a few so I like that feature and that they add it with the new info pretty fast. This app has informed me of ingredients I wasn't aware were harmful. What I don't like is that you cannot manually type in to look up products by name without using a barcode in the free version. Some products I look up online don't have an image of their barcode for me to scan.,3
1608,io.yuka.android,I paid for premium. I am going to give it a year to see if the issues with the app are fixed. Some of the descriptions don't match the product. I scanned fish seasoning and it said it was alcohol. Multiple entries for a product. One says Excellent but with no ingredient list while another says Bad with ingredients. It doesn't list Talc as a harmfull ingredient which is frustrating as that is what led me to wake up to the fact that there are harmful chemicals in our products and download the app.,3
1609,io.yuka.android,"I wanted an app to check for ingredients I avoid. This app requires an account to get past the login and will only let you add a dietary preference if you pay for premium. I dont mind at all paying for apps, but before I do so I want to test it out. Without premium, scanning (only works on barcodes, not the ingredients list) will give you the app's rating for the product, the sources of which is explained in the 'Scoring Method' section. Not a bad app, just not what I was looking for.",3
1610,io.yuka.android,"I rated a 3 because they don't consider the learning curve which makes the app useless, like not having a box with a barcode. the app. I learned about the app from another customer at cvs yesterday. I was very disappointed this morning when I realized a few things. Th barcodes are on the boxes and I threw them out. You have to pay extra to be able to type the item name.  Honestly this sucks!!! I think you should at least offer a free trial automatically upon starting the app.",3
1611,io.yuka.android,So as far as the app goes. It's use is OK if your only looking for toxic chemicals. The app is not right when it comes to counting calories and saturated fat as bad. That's just ridiculous. It's the staple of a keto diet. Also it counts carbs and sugar as ok which again is ridiculous. These need to be changed. It's false info and people who eat a high carb high sugar low fat diet are extremely unhealthy.,3
1612,io.yuka.android,"Was so good, but now it constantly crashes. Even when I'm navigating other apps on my phone and it runs in the background, I get pop ups that it stopped working. I've done the ""send feedback"" option a few times now. It's been a while since this app had an update, it really needs one.",3
1613,io.yuka.android,"I think the concept is great. My concern is the product suggestions. I scanned a hair product used for adding volume, the app rated it as ""Bad"". I scrolled to see what other products are recommended and the app suggested products focused on curl enhancement. So it makes me curious to how reliable these product recommendations are",3
1614,io.yuka.android,App is useful but needs more added to it. When it recommends products or should also reflect its Google product rating. I don't want to buy a product that's healthy for my skin but that doesn't work well. A step above that would be to provide a link to purchase directly from the manufacturer. This app could make more money from affiliate links for upgrades! YW! Another change would be to allow the consumer to sort their scanned and favs by rating.,3
1615,io.yuka.android,"I really like the idea of this app and think it has a lot of potential, but so often I will see the same product, with one saying good and the other saying bad. A good example was toothpaste. Where I kept seeing duplicates with different ratings. I also do think that the ingredients list can sometimes be slightly inaccurate, which can lead to varying results eg having titanium dioxide vs titanium dioxide 2. But when I check the actual product it had the same ingredients list",3
1616,io.yuka.android,"Fantastically useful app. Could do with a few more basic features, filters even on premium. Low rating as can't be added to family library.",3
1617,io.yuka.android,"This is my second yearly subscription I purchased. I like the app but it's been months since I reported it not working well, seems that the glitch hasn't been fixed.",3
1618,io.yuka.android,"Great app. I got a new phone and reinstalled the app. It will not let me use the premium features like search. I tried purchasing it again, but it says that I am already a premium subscriber.",3
1619,io.yuka.android,"Great for personal care products but just alright for food. If you scan something like an organic avocado oil salad dressing it will rate it 30/100 because it ""has too many calories"" and I don't need that in my life. I just want to know if the ingredients are clean or not. Adding cleaning products to the app would also be helpful.",3
1620,io.yuka.android,Great for quickly reading lists. only wish searching for items wasn't a paid feature.,3
1621,io.yuka.android,"Cool app for cosmetics but is too biased about food nutrition. Told me my peanut butter was too fatty... Like YEAH it's peanut butter that's exactly why I'm eating it. I can balance my diet myself I just want to know if they're secretly putting cancer powder in my food, thanks.",3
1622,io.yuka.android,"Would be way more useful if you could attach personal retail sources to your favorite items & be able to filter the list based on retailer. Can you say ""shopping list""?",3
1623,io.yuka.android,A huge improvement would be if it had the price tags next to the new recommended items. Or had an option for simular prices,3
1624,io.yuka.android,"Cool idea. Mostly useful for its details on additives but it's not perfect there either. Many additives that should be listed are not called out. Treatment of fats is overly-simplistic, and warnings about salt are based on old and dated information. On the bright side, the scanner is ridiculously fast and easy to use.",3
1625,io.yuka.android,"Ive scanned 3 things & the info in the app is incorrect! Should be showing sodium or nutrition per 100 grams 2 make it more universal due 2 serving sizes being different. 1 in particular says its ""poor"" due to having so much sodium but the mg of sodium the app lists per serve is 20x as much as it actually is on the bag, and its double the amount of what it is per 100 grams, I wouldnt trust the nutritional rating if sodium is wrong. I use additive alert which tells you which additives are bad.",3
1626,io.yuka.android,"Good app, but needs inprovements. It's fantastic that it shows the additives in items and their inherent risk, however the app should show full ingredients as well. Food labels can be a difficult to read due to the small fonts, so seeing them on the app would be great, simply saying ""some vegetables"" is not good enough. Maybe show more nutritional info too like RDA etc. I also recommended the dev responds to reviews. As it stands not worth paying for, but a solid 3.5 stars and has potential",3
1627,io.yuka.android,This is a very useful app for checking for harmful ingredients in everyday food and cosmetics. I would have given 4 stars at least if it actually worked properly in supermarkets and shops! It doesn't seem to function well with bad signal!,3
1628,io.yuka.android,"The subscription model seems greedy and isn't appealing at all, especially considering the app is based on the free open source openfoodfacts app and database. I don't mind paying for the app but there needs to be a reasonable one time purchase option.",3
1629,io.yuka.android,There are lots of products that are not on the database. There are a few products that have the wrong identity. Is there a way to send you the correct info if it is incorrectly identified. The breakdown of ingredients does not go deep enough. I am looking for 2 specific ingredients that can be covered by things like perfumes. I need to know what perfumes. It is also hard to find this info on the Internet.,3
1630,io.yuka.android,"I started using the app to go grocery shopping, but then the other day I decided to skan my peanut butter that I'm sure has too much sugar and I was surprised to see the yuka app says it is ""good"". The peanut butter is the ""Skippy natural honey"" that contains peanuts, sugar, palm oil peanut oil, honey and salt. How can something that has sugar, be good? Is it a mistake? Just wondering if I can keep trusting it. I really loved the app.",3
1631,io.yuka.android,"This is a great app, but one thing could be improved. I saw many products that have ingredients missing because someone didn't scan properly. Then you have an option to report a problem, and you have the option to scan the package that has ingredients in it. And here is the problem, because there is no option to choose between flat or round packaging. Last time, I reported a change, scanned round package, and still ingredients were missing because I could only upload one photo.",3
1632,io.yuka.android,Scanned everything. Usual culprets identified. Some surprises. It does not recognize bioengineered food ingredients. I have to still read labels. It rates pace salsa as good rating of 60 with bioengineered ingredients. No go with me. The hazardous warnings are valuable. I will probably remove.,3
1633,io.yuka.android,I really like this app. I live the design and the idea but it has 1 major flaw. The fact that people are able to manually contribute additional items that were not in the system before is a GREAT idea and I love it but at the same time it comes with a problem. The app base it's ratings off of 100g of the item however when people input the nutritional data they will use the number that are listed on the product which often are based on a different number of grams. This causes bad data.,3
1634,io.yuka.android,"Yuka has really improved form its inception here in Australia. I've updated my rating accordingly. I would like to see a manual search field and shortcuts when I tap and hold the app. Sure. Scan, search, favourites. My phone offers a function that allows me to tap and hold the fingerprint scanner and select shortcuts + apps. Although I like Yuka — it's a little dissapointing that they still haven't introduced the search functionality here. Deducted one star. Still waiting for the manual search",3
1635,io.yuka.android,"Its great if you have knowledge of nutrition. I wouldn't recommend otherwise. I like the feature that explains additives and their risks, although some information does seem biased and there's a lot of 'may', 'might', 'could' etc. I'm not a huge fan of the ranking system. I've had things rank amazingly because theyre low in calories despite being nutritionally inadequate and had things that are much more substantial rank low because they're higher calorie or have naturally occurring sugars.",3
1636,io.yuka.android,Normally fine.. but today when trying to SCAN barcodes the app shuts down. Not updates to do which usually helps my apps when not working. Sad :(,3
1637,io.yuka.android,"--- Update: brand bias. Exact same products (same ingredients list) of different brands are scored differently. Emailing about the inaccuracy does not help, thus I can only conclude that Yuka is biased. --- Useful! What usually takes a lot of time researching is looked up in a matter of seconds when the product has already been added by someone. Just wish it supported also German for product additions. Recommendations tend to be France-centric, and adding more languages should help ease that.",3
1638,io.yuka.android,"Very good app, the core idea is absolutely incredible! However the app itself could really use an UI update: -could the favorites NOT be hidden in a submenu? Could it be split by categories (at least cosmetic/food, or even better customizable categories) ? -Could the different ""notations"" (fat, sugar, additives, ...) be classified in the same order? It's currently making any attempts at comparing two product quite painful. -following above, could a ""comparison"" tool be added? Thank you!",3
1639,io.yuka.android,Love the app but I bought a subscription and the app closes whenever I try to go on offline even though one of the subscription perks is to be able to scan offline.,3
1640,io.yuka.android,"Great way to check if a product is healthy. The subscription is a kind idea but pretty expensive just to have the offline Modus. I canceled the subscription for next year, 100mb for the data (without pictures) is too much for my use. And the update for offline use lasts ages .my last update runs already 4 hours .this cannot be ...",3
1641,io.yuka.android,"Slightly annoyed with the app. I paid for the subscription, as it said you'd have access to search for all the products without having to scan them. Well, it doesn't seem to work. I searched for several products by name and brand, not found. But when I scanned the var code, the results were available. So why make us pay for a service that doesn't deliver? Be honest about it, it's not the price, it's the ethics.",3
1642,io.yuka.android,"Don't listen to the ""too caloric"" rating. They should honestly remove that rating completely as it's highly inaccurate. 130 calories of an item is not ""too caloric"". You have no idea what someone is eating that day. If someone is trying to watch their diet saying everything is too caloric will certainly cause eating disorders. I love how it shows the potential terrible additives, but the too caloric is annoying and does not make something unhealthy.",3
1643,io.yuka.android,"Works well...when it knows the product. I've had this for a couple months now, but found an issue: it didn't know half of the products I was scanning, and several of the products I scanned were well known such as ELF. After the fiftieth time of being met with disappointment and lost as to weather or not the product I wanted to buy was good for my sensitive and oily skin, I finally grew so frustrated and deleted the app all together.",3
1644,io.yuka.android,"I wish you could put in your own goals,, I'm trying to get healthier after an ed relapse and I'm struggling to eat anything. Everything I've scanned is ""a bit too caloric"" which is really stressing me out. Like pistachios are rated as excellent but ""a bit too caloric"" serving size is 150 calories which I think isnt bad for a meal but I don't wanna have any now because I don't know? Seeing that is causing me more issues than its solving so idk if I'll actually be able to keep using the app :o/",3
1645,io.yuka.android,"bug1: if you make a change according to the valid info and you capture that table of nutrition values that looks different from one the app used to parse you won't be able to commit it. bug2: when you make a picture, crop it and then want to get back to recapture it will return to the edit page with picture loading forever. removed the app because of the bugs and wrong or absent info of products",3
1646,io.yuka.android,"I scan the suggestions still says poor/bad. For example I will scan my equate makeup remover wipes. It says poor and suggests Cetaphil face cleanser which I own. I scan that and says poor. I e also noticed the suggestions sometimes have nothing to do with the scanned item. I scanned eyeshadow primer/base and it suggested eyeshadow palettes. I do like the app because it will tell you why something isn't great, but I think the app still needs some work.",3
1647,io.yuka.android,"The idea is good, but that some languages/countries are not supported makes it useless. I don't know why they don't want to expand... it seems only english, french and german products are supported, but not for sure because I don't find even for that information anywhere besides of screenshots in the web 😕 But don't get me wrong, when you are in an supported country than it's a cool app 🙃",3
1648,io.yuka.android,"Great app!! However there needs to be a manual search option and an option to search for products that you don't have an availiable barcode to scan. Sometimes you may no longer have the box. If these were added, i would rate 5 stars.",3
1649,io.yuka.android,"I like it, it's easy to use and quite nice to check products. It's heavily skewed towards organic products to the point that sometimes I wonder if it's totally fair. Compared two soy sauces, one organic, one not. Both have only one negative point listed: salt. Organic one contains more salt per 100g than other one. However, it's rated excellent and the non-organic one as poor, all due supposedly to lower salt content. I would suggest being more transparent about how not being organic is a minus.",3
1650,io.yuka.android,"Great idea, but unfortunately, too much product is not listed even famous one & you have to write it manually with long procedure.",3
1651,io.yuka.android,I've found quite a few products that are not on the app. I've tried to add the same product twice now and comes back unable to read ingredients. Well the problem is I can't get a clear photo because of the boarder you have to get around the product jumps around everywhere so the no way to line it up. I have literally wasted an hour trying to get photo with the ap,3
1652,io.yuka.android,"Products rated highly as alternatives rates differently when scanned directly. For instance: looking for an alternative to my morning monster, V8 energy drinks showed up in suggestion list for a healthier alternative, rated 86. Purchased, same exact product now scans at 31 ""poor."" Has happened quite often. I like being able to see the list of additives, but I really don't trust the ratings. Are the alternatives paid ads?",3
1653,io.yuka.android,The app is great when it is working. Recently there have been a lot more crashes and continuous loading spinner. I've even tried reporting this as a problem in the app but it kept crashing. Not sure what happened but I am paid for the premium level.,3
1654,io.yuka.android,"Wasn't able to use. During this time of sheltering in place, I'm purchasing more of my personal products online. I don't have a product in front of me to scan the bar code. I was looking forward to using the app, but during this pandemic it would be great to have a search function like ""hair conditioner"" so you can compare results.",3
1655,io.yuka.android,"Wouldn't take everything this app says for gospel. It's only able to scan approximately 7/10 items and confuses similar items with something else. The ""research"" I wouldn't believe everything but it's okay for checking ingredients you don't understand on cosmetic products, given a brief explanation of the ingredients and with the food products it can scan its okay",3
1656,io.yuka.android,Not accurate enough. You seem to take everything into consideration when rating. But you fail to take the type of oil the products contain. You totally disregard canola oil as it is known to be horrible for our health.,3
1657,io.yuka.android,"Hello, the App works great so far and it's easy to use. I do have one question, I've tried using it on a banana and a lemon, the circular sticker with the bar code, but it doesn't work for some reason. The image is clear, and I'm holding it as still as possible but it doesn't seem like it'll scan, am I doing something wrong perhaps?",3
1658,io.yuka.android,"It did find some item but many did not. Even did not find nescafe coffee! But, fairly nice to use and not one of those offensive app that force ads or extra downloads in your face every 5 seconds. I'll keep using it for a while to see if it is any use, or a waste of time.",3
1659,io.yuka.android,"I would like to know more about the ranking algorithm in use, how is natural spring water only a 71/100 literally no additives or anything negative shown... ant telling me my electrolyte drink is too salty is like saying the beach is too sandy... electrolytes are primarily different mineral salts. App does give an interesting break down of foods but i don't fully trust the ranking algorithm.",3
1660,io.yuka.android,"Useful to avoid having to decipher the list of ingredients on items, and check for harmful additives. However I find the ratings are very biased, and mostly exclusively dedicated to overweight people . For example, I'm underweight, so not bent on losing weight and the glucides rate in my blood is under average, so I get annoyed when I see a product rated as mediocre/poor, not because it contains harmful additives but due to being ""too sweet"" or ""too salty"". Too single minded.",3
1661,io.yuka.android,The app itself is great but I paid to subscribe and it still doesn't work in shops. I've given up altogether now because it keeps wanting me to sign in and then doesn’t recognise my password and wants me choose a new password and then that one doesn't work. So I won't be paying again next year.,3
1662,io.yuka.android,"Scans have been inaccurate, along with the products I have added myself. I scanned a container of tablets, and it popped up as deodorant! There should be an option to add vitamins in the food category.",3
1663,io.yuka.android,Wonderful idea for an app. I would be happy to pay for the full version of this app if it was more accurate. Some additives that they list as NO RISK have many risks. Also they don't put much negative weight on high fructose corn syrup. Which everyone knows is horrible for your health. Scanned water case = 100/100 bottle =71/100. Same water. There are many issues like those. I hope they keep improving the information on this app because it has the potential to be amazing!!,3
1664,io.yuka.android,"Great concept, but not enough data to be useful. I scanned about 10 barcodes in my kitchen, and only one came up with info. Maybe it's time to pay for some data entry instead of relying on crowd sourced data.",3
1665,io.yuka.android,"I really appreciate the concept. More people need to read labels and understand what is in the products they consume. However, i became frustrated with this app. Out of the 12 things i scanned only one was already in the database. Common branded toothpastes werent even listed? Update product list so i dont have to manually enter everything i use.",3
1666,io.yuka.android,"Hey, it's a useful app for finding out what is unhealthy or what things you may enjoy are healthy from the app's standards. But when finding out a product is unknown, some criticism, where after trying to fill in information (it makes sense), but the person filling it out is guessing from the nutrition facts which it receives and is still asking clarification on a particular fact in the serving. It would be good for a better way to fill out the information without irritation with it. Thank you.",3
1667,io.yuka.android,"Great App if it works. It crashes ALOT. That's why I gave 3 stars. Since they are independent, I trust them enough to give unbiased reviews of products. I pay for the full version. I hope the bugs will be straightened out soon.",3
1668,io.yuka.android,"I still love the app and will continue to use it, but, based on the way they look at oils (grain and seed oils), the information cannot be accurate, so therefore, I am not sure how some of the ratings affect certain products? 🤔 For instance, canola oil is excellent, and coconut oil or ghee is poor? That makes absolutely no sense! There is new and updated information on this everywhere. You can read up on this and educate yourself.",3
1669,io.yuka.android,Great Concept but....... it has too many duplicate products one saying good and the other one bad. It get very confusing. Also the products recommendation don't match the orginal product genre. Great idea just needs work.,3
1670,io.yuka.android,"I like this app, however as of right now that app isn't worth the purchase when you can't scan so many products such as laundry soap, protein powders, natural products sold in stores. Trying to add products by manually adding has been typically ""not found "" or ""can't add at this time "". Again, I like this app, however not worth the purchase this early in.",3
1671,io.yuka.android,"App works great usually when needed. However, some products aren't registered even with nutrition labels are clearly visible in photos, and when you try to report this, the email mechanism does not work properly and deletes your report",3
1672,io.yuka.android,Really helpful app. Thank you. I've signed up for premium hoping to get more helpful filters like 'tested on animals'. Very disappointed to see it doesn't seem to have any filters.,3
1673,io.yuka.android,"It's useful although unreliable. Some products on this app are apparently carsonagenic for example it says salicylic acid isn't very good and that it could be dangerous although there's not scientific proof it has any issues , a bit disappointed and as someone with Paranoia i know it would have me think my whole house was unsafe , I scanned multiple items and it seems to say that the only safe things to eat or drink is water and apples . Even if soemthing has other nutritional values",3
1674,io.yuka.android,"Love the detail, however the need to scan a barcode to search means that it's next to useless for checking potential new online purchases. Barcode scanning should definitely be the default search method, but there needs to be a manual search as well",3
1675,io.yuka.android,This is a great app! I paid for premium to get recommendations on better products that are good for you and less toxic. HOWEVER I really dislike how it consistently crashes and the frequency of the app closing on me.,3
1676,io.yuka.android,Good idea but a lot of erroneous scores. I've noticed a lot of mistakes in portion size so the app thinks that the relative weight of each nutrients is lower than it is in reality.,3
1677,io.yuka.android,"When trying to add a product, i followed all instructions, then when when i tried going to register it, it kept telling me to check calorie to make sure it was accurate and it was but wouldn't let me get past that part, i continued to click correct, and it wouldn't go to the next step",3
1678,io.yuka.android,"I LOVE this app and have recommended to a lot of people, BUT in the past couple of weeks it won't stop crashing. Never had this problem until recently. Even when not using the app I'll get an alert saying app is not working and to close it.",3
1679,io.yuka.android,"Just installed the app, scaned a few items, I keep getting a message: the product's language is not supported. I don't know if it is because I use English and the products are puchased in French speaking countries. I searched everywhere in the app and couldn't find a language settings in this app, please fix this, thanks.",3
1680,io.yuka.android,"I love the app, though when trying to add a product, the camera is mostly unusable. I just tried to add a product, and I gave up after many attempts to get a good photo. Please get rid of the auto crop.",3
1681,io.yuka.android,All of my choices are reviewed negativity in this app. Even my face cream. Suggested a higher priced item from the same manufacturer.,3
1682,io.yuka.android,"The app is simple and looks nice. My complaint is that I can't adjust how the ratings are calculated. I'm primarily focused on basic nutrition. I don't care about food additives, especially when there is no apparent basis for declaring them hazardous. I even double-checked some of them with the very organizations Yuka claims as its sources. Just because something didn't grow out of the ground doesn't automatically make it toxic.",3
1683,io.yuka.android,Nice idea but needs work. Need to be able to size the photo area as it doesn't always get everything on the nutrition label. Also need to be able to add things in different measurements. In Canada it is metric. I'm not going to the trouble of converting to grams while at a store.,3
1684,io.yuka.android,"Hi. Mr. Boss I have a news for you, do you come to a point where listing of every items you had to buy in the shop is so frustrating well I have discovered a device which I call Mr. Smart and fast all it does is scan all.the Previous thing and save it the device. And is ready for your shopping.yo don't have to do anything. All there is ⚒️⚒️⛏️ to do is pick go and start packing. To me this is what I call technology fast and easy.",3
1685,io.yuka.android,I really love your app the organic products have bad food additives solve a progress products they recommend have bioengineering food genetic wheat and GMOs,3
1686,io.yuka.android,Just ok... I was scanning 3 dif flavors of juice and noticed the scores changing but all the amounts under the nutritional valued at the same. So it is a little bit confusing how they are scoring the items,3

1688,io.yuka.android,"The item descriptions seem a little biased... If it's not made from water, flour, oil, etc... ""It's bad for you."" Plus, the addition of a missing item is tedious telling me that I input the wrong unit of measure for calories... Uh, okay?",3
1689,io.yuka.android,"I appreciate the app, however I wish they would add to the rating mechanism the use of seed oils. So many products that contain them that get decent ratings because they don't have much fat, yet lot of products that are healthy without seed oils but get trashed on the app because they contain good natural fats in them.",3
1690,io.yuka.android,"Not accurate INGREDIENTS LISTS ON SOME PRODUCTS. I have sent an information with a pictures attached about one of the Organic Children sun cream, that is made by Green People. However after two weeks it still has not been corrected. It has a harmful ingredient - TITANIUM DIOXIDE (NANO) THAT You DO NOT SHOW ON YOUR LIST ONCE SCANNED THE PRODUCT.I just wonder how many of these you actually have on your app that actually is not what it is inside! So the rating is totally inadequate.Can you fix it",3
1691,io.yuka.android,"I like this app but I wish there was some more in-depth info. For example, Frank's hot sauce was rated bad (32/100) and on yeah, too much sodium but it also says high in saturated fats and I'm looking at the ingredients off the bottle and I'm googling and I cannot find any saturated fat in Frank's. It's literally cayenne pepper, salt, vinegar, water and garlic powder. Where did saturated fats come from? Definitely makes me feel I can't trust the app....",3

1697,io.yuka.android,I like this app on the beginning but today I was scanning my dry roasted peanuts with sea salt 33/100 poor ok.. then I was looking for a recommendations and the exact same product shows up with 63/100 good. I'm confused... it's a good product or a bad product🤔🤔🤔,3
1698,io.yuka.android,It's good but Lacks carbohydrates readings even with the paid version. So it makes it very limited on the information that is actually on the side of the package,3
1699,io.yuka.android,"Amazing app, although I would suggest you add a calorie per certain gram calculator. Basically let's say a product gives 350 calories per 100 grams and u have the same bar of chocolate except its 38 grams and u want to know how much calories that gives. Please add a calorie calculator function :).",3
1700,io.yuka.android,"Cool idea but if a product is not organic and absolutely 100% ""healthy"" for you, it shows you that it's considered a ""bad"" food.

1701,io.yuka.android,"This app can be very useful at times, but the problem is that some products that are the same could be rated completely differently. I once scanned Cetaphil cleanser and it was rated bad, but it recommended Cetaphil cleanser. I don't get it?",3

For instance, Yuka consider ingredients Octocrylene high risks based on only one scientific research, however, in several other reliable sources, I found the conclusions largely different from that of Yuka's based on more scientific researches including the one Yuka is listing. I would sincerely appreciate if Yuka can dig deeper into ingredients before jumping to conclusions and ended up feeding skewed viewpoints to their users.",3
1706,io.yuka.android,It works and helps you figure out foods that aren't so good for you however simple features like searching for items are locked out by a premium subscription.,3

1711,io.yuka.android,Very good app. However can you add a catagory for added sugars since those are different from natural sugar. Would be nice also if you could work added sugars into your health scale algorithm. Also can you add vegetable oil to bad additives?,3
1712,io.yuka.android,Nice app which is easy to use. I just wish it would give detail about whether or not the product contains animal products and whether it is cruelty free.,3

1729,io.yuka.android,Why the extra clicks to view additives? All on one page please 🙂 Not sure why a bag of crisps would score 72... Healthy junk food? Keep up the improvements and I'll probably upgrade.,3
1730,io.yuka.android,"Cool app, but it needs to rate ""fragrance/parfum"" or anything like it significantly heavier. Those are most often carcinogen, allergen, and chemical irritant containing cocktails of chemically derived additives that endanger people who have allergies and asthma. There's a reason entire shelves are fragrance free products these days.",3
1731,io.yuka.android,Honestly this app is mostly just telling you the information on the back of the box. Take it or leave it really. My bigger question is: how has Instacart not sure you for your mascot and logo? :O,3
1732,io.yuka.android,I bought the premium package. But i can not add unknowing products. Keeping takeing picture of the product for half an hour and nothing happen.,3
1733,io.yuka.android,"I love it but, I guess I signed in using Facebook and I deleted Facebook completely and now I can't get into it. I tried email but told me to go through Facebook.",3
1734,io.yuka.android,"I have a different country on the app on my tablet it gives me products from another country,language. On my phone it is USA products which is what I need,.",3
1735,io.yuka.android,"There are multiple entries for one item, with different ratings so you don't know which one is right. Easy to use app",3
1736,io.yuka.android,Good concept but you need to do more research on sodium. Any scientific report from the 21st century will show you there is no link between cardiovascular disease and sodium.,3
1737,io.yuka.android,"Offline scans and searches are exclusive to the premium version - fair enough, but how about choosing a custom language for the app?",3
1738,io.yuka.android,"Interesting but most of the ""nocif"" ingredients are fine and only backed by scaremongering. Also ""not compatible"" with unlocked devices, seriously?",3
1739,io.yuka.android,"Never loads up, white refreshing page. (on pixel 5) EDIT: started working but still buggy, also seems a bit bias tbh 🤔",3
1740,io.yuka.android,Didn't like it most of the product can't be find. Also not much of options in setting. I want to delete my account and there is no such option.,3
1741,io.yuka.android,"It's good but the problem is when I try to fill in information about something that is missing said information, It just shows a blank white page and nothing comes up?",3
1742,io.yuka.android,"I could not do anything in this app when searching to buy online. Please allow us to search for items by category, and sort them by best ratings.",3
1743,io.yuka.android,"Great app and easy to use. However, you have to create an account or use your Facebook one to use it. Unfortunately, it's a no-go for me so if it doesn't bother you, give it a try",3
1744,io.yuka.android,Nice and keeps things simple. A BIGGER LIST for excellent alternative products would be fabulous.,3
1745,io.yuka.android,Idk why you have to have a member to search. Organic cereal peanut butter dot says that it is a bit too salty and a bit to Cal and a bit too Sweet. And I don't know if this app is accurate ? And seems like everything in our house is bad for me,3
1746,io.yuka.android,Cool but totally bugged that it says polysorbate is safe... It's a known irritant and allergy to a lot of people. I'll stick to looking up products on my own.,3
1747,io.yuka.android,"I like the concept, but no.. I appreciate this app kind of doing what it says it is supposed to do. However people can write whatever they wish and that means biased opinions. Coffee & caffeine is not good for you. It is a marketing scheme which is why I quit Coffee and switched to MUD WTR. Be careful of this app. You should know if something is natural or man-made.",3
1748,io.yuka.android,I absolutely love this app but it's not launching on my phone. Anytime I try to open the app it closes.,3
1749,io.yuka.android,Great product. Difficulty in sharing with family and friends. No ease of use in sharing with family and friends.,3
1750,io.yuka.android,"Very good to understand what's inside your food, but it also feels like it tells me 90% of my diet is out to kill me. And I consider myself a healthy eater.",3
1751,io.yuka.android,Good but needs improvement and clarity.,3
1752,io.yuka.android,For cosmetics i strongly suggest the App INCI Beauty which I find excellent. Still experiencing with Yuka for food products.,3
1753,io.yuka.android,"People should be aware that this app doesn't alert to canola, vegetable or seed oils. If a product contains any of these, it is not ""excellent"".",3
1754,io.yuka.android,"I used this app to scan magic spoon and it said bad, I accidently scanned germ-×the hand sanitizer and it said ""excellent "" 😂😂 hello! No thanks!",3
1755,io.yuka.android,Now showing French description instead of English,3
1756,io.yuka.android,It's ok. Like the scoring and suggested alternatives. Adding new items doesn't work.,3
1757,io.yuka.android,It's good somewhat but I don't like how you have to pay to change food preferences,3
1758,io.yuka.android,this app desperately lacks a feature allowing to compare two or more products at once. get on it YUKA TEAM!,3
1759,io.yuka.android,It is supposed to scan food but it sometimes says yuka doesn't rate this. I don't get it...,3
1760,io.yuka.android,I really like this app a lot.. but it has no scoring for foods that contain lectins ....,3
1761,io.yuka.android,I wish you would support more languages.,3
1762,io.yuka.android,"I just downloaded this app, I scanned three items then I scanned organic bananas I just got, just to check out the app. Why did my banana's pop up as ""Iphone (Ramen Noodles Flavor)""?🤣🤣🤣",3
1763,io.yuka.android,"The app is good but does not have many brands, especially Asian and Chinese brands",3
1764,io.yuka.android,"I bought premium but offline mode still doesn't work and it only downloads about 15mb out of 50, why?",3
1765,io.yuka.android,Virtually all recommended products are French. An 100% independent app?,3
1766,io.yuka.android,Doesn't scan a lot of things better with scanning food then cosmetics,3
1767,io.yuka.android,Not bad however scanning often goes dark and doesn't scan.,3
1768,io.yuka.android,Very good I just don't like how it'll bring the score down drastically if anything is over 100 calories,3
1769,io.yuka.android,Could not bring up a scanner to scan the bar code,3
1770,io.yuka.android,I try to put in information for new products and on the last step it just doesn't let me click validate,3
1771,io.yuka.android,Why signing in? I wouldn't expect a scanner to to force me create an account or login using Facebook.,3
1772,io.yuka.android,Great expect that I donated 10 dollars and I'm still not a premium member. Scammed me.,3
1773,io.yuka.android,Undecided on this one. Scanned almond milk in the fridge. Marked as poor. Grabbed the chocolate milk right next to it. Marked good. So idk,3
1774,io.yuka.android,"Great app, however I would go for premium only if it label halal products.",3
1775,io.yuka.android,Only because I can't move it to my SD CARD,3
1776,io.yuka.android,5/5 but as of late nothing is loading,3
1777,io.yuka.android,Needs more updates on product barcodes but it's still good,3
1778,io.yuka.android,"If all the substitutes are accurate, then you are on the way to a more healthier lifestyle.",3
1779,io.yuka.android,"Helpful, but needs more items that are not already entered",3
1780,io.yuka.android,Just curious how long was this app under development and how big was the team? Seems good but I'm weary,3
1781,io.yuka.android,Hello Arabic language should be added to the application,3
1782,io.yuka.android,Great app. But it's not taking a picture of the product i wanted,3
1783,io.yuka.android,It's decent but alot of unknown barcodes,3
1784,io.yuka.android,"Just started using it, so I'll hey back to you on how it is, it haven't been long, but it's ok.",3
1785,io.yuka.android,This app needs to be updated their are lots of food products.,3
1786,io.yuka.android,Not bad..but there are sertain brands that can't be identified,3
1787,io.yuka.android,KNOWING THE TRUTH A OUT FOOD AND PRODUCTS IS A LIFE SAVER.!,3
1788,io.yuka.android,There's a bug in the app please fix it,3
1789,io.yuka.android,"Good, but doesn't let me add an unknown syrup brand because Yuka somehow believes the kcal value is wrong.",3
1790,io.yuka.android,App should allow people to contribute for example updated ingredients labels...,3
1791,io.yuka.android,Could be really cool if I could add my own allergies,3
1792,io.yuka.android,Great for those that don't know how to read labels. Pointless for those of us that do.,3
1793,io.yuka.android,App takes very long to open,3
1794,io.yuka.android,Some slow running,3
1795,io.yuka.android,why this app logo is kinda similar to FL studio's one 🤨🤨,3
1796,io.yuka.android,It would be nice if they did not make you sign in.,3
1797,io.yuka.android,Discrepancies with other similar apps!,3
1798,io.yuka.android,"How about spelling the word ""eat"" on the introduction page correct? Yikes.",3
1799,io.yuka.android,Doesn't understand Most food around the world,3
1800,io.yuka.android,"Great app. I got a new phone and reinstalled the app. It will not let me use the premium features like search. I tried purchasing it again, but it says that I am already a premium subscriber.",3
1801,io.yuka.android,Slow,3
1802,io.yuka.android,Great for quickly reading lists. only wish searching for items wasn't a paid feature.,3
1803,io.yuka.android,App is useful but needs more added to it. When it recommends products or should also reflect its Google product rating. I don't want to buy a product that's healthy for my skin but that doesn't work well. A step above that would be to provide a link to purchase directly from the manufacturer. This app could make more money from affiliate links for upgrades! YW! Another change would be to allow the consumer to sort their scanned and favs by rating.,3
1804,io.yuka.android,"Works fast. Nice and simple UI. The app is only really good for checking additives. It doesn't make everything I've done research into and know is bad. Their ratings follow a one-size-fits-all model which isn't really accurate as everyone has different needs in their diet. Overall though, it serves as a good starting point for a healthier life.",3
1805,io.yuka.android,All of my choices are reviewed negativity in this app. Even my face cream. Suggested a higher priced item from the same manufacturer.,3
1806,io.yuka.android,"Fantastically useful app. Could do with a few more basic features, filters even on premium. Low rating as can't be added to family library.",3
1807,io.yuka.android,"This is my second yearly subscription I purchased. I like the app but it's been months since I reported it not working well, seems that the glitch hasn't been fixed.",3
1808,io.yuka.android,"Would be way more useful if you could attach personal retail sources to your favorite items & be able to filter the list based on retailer. Can you say ""shopping list""?",3
1809,io.yuka.android,A huge improvement would be if it had the price tags next to the new recommended items. Or had an option for simular prices,3
1810,io.yuka.android,"Cool app for cosmetics but is too biased about food nutrition. Told me my peanut butter was too fatty... Like YEAH it's peanut butter that's exactly why I'm eating it. I can balance my diet myself I just want to know if they're secretly putting cancer powder in my food, thanks.",3
1811,io.yuka.android,I really love your app the organic products have bad food additives solve a progress products they recommend have bioengineering food genetic wheat and GMOs,3
1812,io.yuka.android,Only because I can't move it to my SD CARD,3
1813,io.yuka.android,Normally fine.. but today when trying to SCAN barcodes the app shuts down. Not updates to do which usually helps my apps when not working. Sad :(,3
1814,io.yuka.android,"The subscription model seems greedy and isn't appealing at all, especially considering the app is based on the free open source openfoodfacts app and database. I don't mind paying for the app but there needs to be a reasonable one time purchase option.",3
1815,io.yuka.android,Good but needs improvement and clarity.,3
1816,io.yuka.android,"I started using the app to go grocery shopping, but then the other day I decided to skan my peanut butter that I'm sure has too much sugar and I was surprised to see the yuka app says it is ""good"". The peanut butter is the ""Skippy natural honey"" that contains peanuts, sugar, palm oil peanut oil, honey and salt. How can something that has sugar, be good? Is it a mistake? Just wondering if I can keep trusting it. I really loved the app.",3
1817,io.yuka.android,"I really like the idea of this app and think it has a lot of potential, but so often I will see the same product, with one saying good and the other saying bad. A good example was toothpaste. Where I kept seeing duplicates with different ratings. I also do think that the ingredients list can sometimes be slightly inaccurate, which can lead to varying results eg having titanium dioxide vs titanium dioxide 2. But when I check the actual product it had the same ingredients list",3
1818,io.yuka.android,Scanned everything. Usual culprets identified. Some surprises. It does not recognize bioengineered food ingredients. I have to still read labels. It rates pace salsa as good rating of 60 with bioengineered ingredients. No go with me. The hazardous warnings are valuable. I will probably remove.,3
1819,io.yuka.android,"Good app, but needs inprovements. It's fantastic that it shows the additives in items and their inherent risk, however the app should show full ingredients as well. Food labels can be a difficult to read due to the small fonts, so seeing them on the app would be great, simply saying ""some vegetables"" is not good enough. Maybe show more nutritional info too like RDA etc. I also recommended the dev responds to reviews. As it stands not worth paying for, but a solid 3.5 stars and has potential",3
1820,io.yuka.android,This is a very useful app for checking for harmful ingredients in everyday food and cosmetics. I would have given 4 stars at least if it actually worked properly in supermarkets and shops! It doesn't seem to function well with bad signal!,3
1821,io.yuka.android,"This app is convenient for looking up and learning ingredients to avoid allergies, but the ratings are so unreliable. It mind blows me how they would rate a makeup product ""poor"" just from having a single essential preservative. They don't take into account the dose. Also some foreign products are rated ""good"" when the ingredient list isn't even complete. It's like all the database is manually updated by users, and reviewed by robots.",3
1822,io.yuka.android,"Work in progress. Tried it on a few things and although it works, it only seems to care about fat, sugar and salt; less so about food being ultra processed for now.",3
1823,io.yuka.android,"For the most part I really like this app, but until it stops working so inconsistently I will not be paying for the full features. I can usually get five scans out of it before the app goes offline and won't respond. Wifi and full service doesn't matter and it won't work again until I've force quit it half a dozen times. Really adds a lot of time to grocery shopping. Another feature I'm hoping to see added is identification of seed oils. Right now it still shows those foods as good options.",3
1824,io.yuka.android,"Great idea, but unfortunately, too much product is not listed even famous one & you have to write it manually with long procedure.",3
1825,io.yuka.android,"Hi. Mr. Boss I have a news for you, do you come to a point where listing of every items you had to buy in the shop is so frustrating well I have discovered a device which I call Mr. Smart and fast all it does is scan all.the Previous thing and save it the device. And is ready for your shopping.yo don't have to do anything. All there is ⚒️⚒️⛏️ to do is pick go and start packing. To me this is what I call technology fast and easy.",3
1826,io.yuka.android,It's good somewhat but I don't like how you have to pay to change food preferences,3
1827,io.yuka.android,I wish you would support more languages.,3
1828,io.yuka.android,5/5 but as of late nothing is loading,3
1829,io.yuka.android,There are lots of products that are not on the database. There are a few products that have the wrong identity. Is there a way to send you the correct info if it is incorrectly identified. The breakdown of ingredients does not go deep enough. I am looking for 2 specific ingredients that can be covered by things like perfumes. I need to know what perfumes. It is also hard to find this info on the Internet.,3
1830,io.yuka.android,Now showing French description instead of English,3
1831,io.yuka.android,"Ive scanned 3 things & the info in the app is incorrect! Should be showing sodium or nutrition per 100 grams 2 make it more universal due 2 serving sizes being different. 1 in particular says its ""poor"" due to having so much sodium but the mg of sodium the app lists per serve is 20x as much as it actually is on the bag, and its double the amount of what it is per 100 grams, I wouldnt trust the nutritional rating if sodium is wrong. I use additive alert which tells you which additives are bad.",3
1832,io.yuka.android,"Cool idea. Mostly useful for its details on additives but it's not perfect there either. Many additives that should be listed are not called out. Treatment of fats is overly-simplistic, and warnings about salt are based on old and dated information. On the bright side, the scanner is ridiculously fast and easy to use.",3
1833,io.yuka.android,Not accurate enough. You seem to take everything into consideration when rating. But you fail to take the type of oil the products contain. You totally disregard canola oil as it is known to be horrible for our health.,3
1834,io.yuka.android,"Half good, half bad. I've bought items on the app that came up as excellent, only to scan again a few days later and they suddenly have a rating of bad, same bottles, same ingredients, no idea why the change and having to waste money. Other main issue is after paying for the search services, more than half the time it doesn't work. You enter the name, hit search and nothing happens. Again total waste of money. I am learning the names of the ""bad"" ingredients, I suppose that's helpful.",3
1835,io.yuka.android,Love the app but I bought a subscription and the app closes whenever I try to go on offline even though one of the subscription perks is to be able to scan offline.,3
1836,io.yuka.android,"Great for personal care products but just alright for food. If you scan something like an organic avocado oil salad dressing it will rate it 30/100 because it ""has too many calories"" and I don't need that in my life. I just want to know if the ingredients are clean or not. Adding cleaning products to the app would also be helpful.",3
1837,io.yuka.android,Hello Arabic language should be added to the application,3
1838,io.yuka.android,Not bad however scanning often goes dark and doesn't scan.,3
1839,io.yuka.android,"I like this app, however as of right now that app isn't worth the purchase when you can't scan so many products such as laundry soap, protein powders, natural products sold in stores. Trying to add products by manually adding has been typically ""not found "" or ""can't add at this time "". Again, I like this app, however not worth the purchase this early in.",3
1840,io.yuka.android,"People should be aware that this app doesn't alert to canola, vegetable or seed oils. If a product contains any of these, it is not ""excellent"".",3
1841,io.yuka.android,"It did find some item but many did not. Even did not find nescafe coffee! But, fairly nice to use and not one of those offensive app that force ads or extra downloads in your face every 5 seconds. I'll keep using it for a while to see if it is any use, or a waste of time.",3
1842,io.yuka.android,Cool but I don't know if I believe most of the stuff on here. Maybe I'm in denial.,3
1843,io.yuka.android,Very good I just don't like how it'll bring the score down drastically if anything is over 100 calories,3
1844,io.yuka.android,"Hello, the App works great so far and it's easy to use. I do have one question, I've tried using it on a banana and a lemon, the circular sticker with the bar code, but it doesn't work for some reason. The image is clear, and I'm holding it as still as possible but it doesn't seem like it'll scan, am I doing something wrong perhaps?",3
1845,io.yuka.android,"It's great BUT, I can't find how to manually search for a product. One has to scan the barcode before you get a review?? How do I check something before I buy if I'm buying online???",3

1848,io.yuka.android,"Not accurate INGREDIENTS LISTS ON SOME PRODUCTS. I have sent an information with a pictures attached about one of the Organic Children sun cream, that is made by Green People. However after two weeks it still has not been corrected. It has a harmful ingredient - TITANIUM DIOXIDE (NANO) THAT You DO NOT SHOW ON YOUR LIST ONCE SCANNED THE PRODUCT.I just wonder how many of these you actually have on your app that actually is not what it is inside! So the rating is totally inadequate.Can you fix it",3

1854,io.yuka.android,It's ok,3
1855,io.yuka.android,"This is a great app, but one thing could be improved. I saw many products that have ingredients missing because someone didn't scan properly. Then you have an option to report a problem, and you have the option to scan the package that has ingredients in it. And here is the problem, because there is no option to choose between flat or round packaging. Last time, I reported a change, scanned round package, and still ingredients were missing because I could only upload one photo.",3
1856,io.yuka.android,I like that I can scan products that I use like shampoos and deodorants but I'm not sure about the rating on the foods. Some of the foods you rate high on are not good and some that you claim is bad is good for you.,3
1857,io.yuka.android,"I appreciate the app, however I wish they would add to the rating mechanism the use of seed oils. So many products that contain them that get decent ratings because they don't have much fat, yet lot of products that are healthy without seed oils but get trashed on the app because they contain good natural fats in them.",3
1858,io.yuka.android,"Great app!! However there needs to be a manual search option and an option to search for products that you don't have an availiable barcode to scan. Sometimes you may no longer have the box. If these were added, i would rate 5 stars.",3
1859,io.yuka.android,"Wouldn't take everything this app says for gospel. It's only able to scan approximately 7/10 items and confuses similar items with something else. The ""research"" I wouldn't believe everything but it's okay for checking ingredients you don't understand on cosmetic products, given a brief explanation of the ingredients and with the food products it can scan its okay",3
1860,io.yuka.android,"The idea is good, but that some languages/countries are not supported makes it useless. I don't know why they don't want to expand... it seems only english, french and german products are supported, but not for sure because I don't find even for that information anywhere besides of screenshots in the web 😕 But don't get me wrong, when you are in an supported country than it's a cool app 🙃",3
1861,io.yuka.android,Didn't like it most of the product can't be find. Also not much of options in setting. I want to delete my account and there is no such option.,3

1866,io.yuka.android,"I still love the app and will continue to use it, but, based on the way they look at oils (grain and seed oils), the information cannot be accurate, so therefore, I am not sure how some of the ratings affect certain products? 🤔 For instance, canola oil is excellent, and coconut oil or ghee is poor? That makes absolutely no sense! There is new and updated information on this everywhere. You can read up on this and educate yourself.",3
1867,io.yuka.android,I've found quite a few products that are not on the app. I've tried to add the same product twice now and comes back unable to read ingredients.

I do like the app because it will tell you why something isn't great, but I think the app still needs some work.",3
1873,io.yuka.android,"There are multiple entries for one item, with different ratings so you don't know which one is right. Easy to use app",3
1874,io.yuka.android,Undecided on this one. Scanned almond milk in the fridge. Marked as poor. Grabbed the chocolate milk right next to it. Marked good. So idk,3
1875,io.yuka.android,"Don't listen to the ""too caloric"" rating. They should honestly remove that rating completely as it's highly inaccurate. 130 calories of an item is not ""too caloric"". You have no idea what someone is eating that day. If someone is trying to watch their diet saying everything is too caloric will certainly cause eating disorders. I love how it shows the potential terrible additives, but the too caloric is annoying and does not make something unhealthy.",3
1876,io.yuka.android,Discrepancies with other similar apps!,3
1877,io.yuka.android,"At first I really liked it cuz it would even show on some organic products that it's not good. But then I was checking snacks and snickers yogurt snack was showing ""good"" like 75/100 but it had MODIFIED corn starch!!!!!! 😡 HOW?! It's like a poison! Just cuz it says ""low fat"" which in my opinion is not healthy!",3
1878,io.yuka.android,"Just started using it, so I'll hey back to you on how it is, it haven't been long, but it's ok.",3
1879,io.yuka.android,"Great App if it works. It crashes ALOT. That's why I gave 3 stars. Since they are independent, I trust them enough to give unbiased reviews of products. I pay for the full version. I hope the bugs will be straightened out soon.",3
1880,io.yuka.android,"I LOVE this app and have recommended to a lot of people, BUT in the past couple of weeks it won't stop crashing. Never had this problem until recently. Even when not using the app I'll get an alert saying app is not working and to close it.",3
1881,io.yuka.android,"Was so good, but now it constantly crashes. Even when I'm navigating other apps on my phone and it runs in the background, I get pop ups that it stopped working. I've done the ""send feedback"" option a few times now. It's been a while since this app had an update, it really needs one.",3
1882,io.yuka.android,This is a great app! I paid for premium to get recommendations on better products that are good for you and less toxic. HOWEVER I really dislike how it consistently crashes and the frequency of the app closing on me.,3
1883,io.yuka.android,The app is great when it is working. Recently there have been a lot more crashes and continuous loading spinner. I've even tried reporting this as a problem in the app but it kept crashing. Not sure what happened but I am paid for the premium level.,3
1884,io.yuka.android,"Used to like this app, but it only works for products in the US. I moved away, and none of the brands outside of the country have been registered, so I don’t have any use for this app anymore.",3
1885,io.yuka.android,"I rated a 3 because they don't consider the learning curve which makes the app useless, like not having a box with a barcode. the app. I learned about the app from another customer at cvs yesterday. I was very disappointed this morning when I realized a few things. Th barcodes are on the boxes and I threw them out. You have to pay extra to be able to type the item name.  Honestly this sucks!!! I think you should at least offer a free trial automatically upon starting the app.",3
1886,io.yuka.android,"This app can be very useful at times, but the problem is that some products that are the same could be rated completely differently. I once scanned Cetaphil cleanser and it was rated bad, but it recommended Cetaphil cleanser. I don't get it?",3
1887,io.yuka.android,what about ingredients not nutrition facts?,3
1888,io.yuka.android,"Great concept but the premium feature doesn't work. Every time I try to proceed with the payment, by the time I've approved it in my bank's app, it's timed out in Yuka 🙈 Been trying to many times now, it's getting frustrating.",3
1889,io.yuka.android,The last week or 2 I've been getting alerts that app is crashing. I not able to open the app without it crashing. I am a paying subscriber 😔,3
1890,io.yuka.android,"I love the app, though when trying to add a product, the camera is mostly unusable. I just tried to add a product, and I gave up after many attempts to get a good photo. Please get rid of the auto crop.",3
1891,io.yuka.android,Really helpful app. Thank you. I've signed up for premium hoping to get more helpful filters like 'tested on animals'. Very disappointed to see it doesn't seem to have any filters.,3
1892,io.yuka.android,"Excellente information, mais l'interface reste à améliorer: il faudrait que l'app s'ouvre directement sur le lecteur de codes barre.",3
1893,io.yuka.android,"Yuka has really improved form its inception here in Australia. I've updated my rating accordingly. I would like to see a manual search field and shortcuts when I tap and hold the app. Sure. Scan, search, favourites. My phone offers a function that allows me to tap and hold the fingerprint scanner and select shortcuts + apps. Although I like Yuka — it's a little dissapointing that they still haven't introduced the search functionality here. Deducted one star. Still waiting for the manual search",3
1894,io.yuka.android,Nice and keeps things simple. A BIGGER LIST for excellent alternative products would be fabulous.,3
1895,io.yuka.android,Love Love my job,3
1896,io.yuka.android,"This app marks certain foods as ""good"" y'all need to educate yourselves on certain ingredients. For example, Late July organic nacho chips are marked as ""good"" but the ingredients has ""seed oils"" people need to know that seed oils causes inflammation. Just because a product uses ""organic"" seed oils doesn't mean it's completely healthy.",3
1897,io.yuka.android,Really good,3
1898,io.yuka.android,Some slow running,3
1899,io.yuka.android,"This app is very inconsistent when you use the search feature. I looked up an inkey list product and got mixed results. One said it was excellent and others said it was bad. For a paid experience I expected more. Maybe I am using it wrong. Also, there A LOT of main stream products that do not show up in the search feature which is the main reason I went on and paid for premium version. Overall, I am pretty disappointed that I spend the money.",3
1900,io.yuka.android,Nice idea but needs work. Need to be able to size the photo area as it doesn't always get everything on the nutrition label. Also need to be able to add things in different measurements. In Canada it is metric. I'm not going to the trouble of converting to grams while at a store.,3
1901,io.yuka.android,Why you can't rate honey or Pearl Millimg (Aunt Jemima) syrup?,3
1902,io.yuka.android,"I think the concept is great. My concern is the product suggestions. I scanned a hair product used for adding volume, the app rated it as ""Bad"". I scrolled to see what other products are recommended and the app suggested products focused on curl enhancement. So it makes me curious to how reliable these product recommendations are",3
1903,io.yuka.android,"Its great if you have knowledge of nutrition. I wouldn't recommend otherwise. I like the feature that explains additives and their risks, although some information does seem biased and there's a lot of 'may', 'might', 'could' etc. I'm not a huge fan of the ranking system. I've had things rank amazingly because theyre low in calories despite being nutritionally inadequate and had things that are much more substantial rank low because they're higher calorie or have naturally occurring sugars.",3
1904,io.yuka.android,"Never loads up, white refreshing page. (on pixel 5) EDIT: started working but still buggy, also seems a bit bias tbh 🤔",3
1905,io.yuka.android,It's good but Lacks carbohydrates readings even with the paid version. So it makes it very limited on the information that is actually on the side of the package,3
1906,io.yuka.android,"Products rated highly as alternatives rates differently when scanned directly. For instance: looking for an alternative to my morning monster, V8 energy drinks showed up in suggestion list for a healthier alternative, rated 86. Purchased, same exact product now scans at 31 ""poor."" Has happened quite often. I like being able to see the list of additives, but I really don't trust the ratings. Are the alternatives paid ads?",3
1907,io.yuka.android,"I like that you can scan both food & cosmetic products, but I do not like that you cannot use the search feature for free. With fooducate, you can do both.",3
1908,io.yuka.android,"I will pay premium without even thinking if you could search for high protein products. That is something a lot of people are searching for it and no app is doing. You have the info to make it posible in a simple way, not a lot of dev work. Make it happen please",3
1909,io.yuka.android,oh yeah,3
1910,io.yuka.android,I paid for premium. I am going to give it a year to see if the issues with the app are fixed. Some of the descriptions don't match the product. I scanned fish seasoning and it said it was alcohol. Multiple entries for a product. One says Excellent but with no ingredient list while another says Bad with ingredients. It doesn't list Talc as a harmfull ingredient which is frustrating as that is what led me to wake up to the fact that there are harmful chemicals in our products and download the app.,3
1911,io.yuka.android,"How about spelling the word ""eat"" on the introduction page correct? Yikes.",3
1912,io.yuka.android,Great Concept but....... it has too many duplicate products one saying good and the other one bad. It get very confusing. Also the products recommendation don't match the orginal product genre. Great idea just needs work.,3
1913,io.yuka.android,KNOWING THE TRUTH A OUT FOOD AND PRODUCTS IS A LIFE SAVER.!,3
1914,io.yuka.android,Not sure,3
1915,io.yuka.android,I'm getting really sick of the glitches. I paid to use this app offline and when I need it the most (inside a grocery store that I don't get service in) I'm told by the app I can't use it offline. What did I pay for then?,3
1916,io.yuka.android,Brief,3
1917,io.yuka.android,walmart everything is better for you even if its no good for you they payed the most to get better ratings tropicana has a poor rating of 30 because its to sweet but 100% walmart juice has the same stuff but gets a 60 🤑 (nutritional facts are the same should be the same rating) and is exactly the same product made in the same factory just different bottle 😵😘🤯,3
1918,io.yuka.android,"The item descriptions seem a little biased... If it's not made from water, flour, oil, etc... ""It's bad for you."" Plus, the addition of a missing item is tedious telling me that I input the wrong unit of measure for calories... Uh, okay?",3
1919,io.yuka.android,"Hey, it's a useful app for finding out what is unhealthy or what things you may enjoy are healthy from the app's standards. But when finding out a product is unknown, some criticism, where after trying to fill in information (it makes sense), but the person filling it out is guessing from the nutrition facts which it receives and is still asking clarification on a particular fact in the serving. It would be good for a better way to fill out the information without irritation with it. Thank you.",3
1920,io.yuka.android,Great app. But it's not taking a picture of the product i wanted,3
1921,io.yuka.android,Honestly this app is mostly just telling you the information on the back of the box. Take it or leave it really. My bigger question is: how has Instacart not sure you for your mascot and logo? :O,3
1922,io.yuka.android,"So so... I have a toothpaste made in India that's excellent, I think. But it doesn't have a barcode. It has a QR code. This app can't scan it! What?",3
1923,io.yuka.android,I like this app on the beginning but today I was scanning my dry roasted peanuts with sea salt 33/100 poor ok.. then I was looking for a recommendations and the exact same product shows up with 63/100 good. I'm confused... it's a good product or a bad product🤔🤔🤔,3
1924,io.yuka.android,"Very good app, the core idea is absolutely incredible! However the app itself could really use an UI update: -could the favorites NOT be hidden in a submenu? Could it be split by categories (at least cosmetic/food, or even better customizable categories) ? -Could the different ""notations"" (fat, sugar, additives, ...) be classified in the same order? It's currently making any attempts at comparing two product quite painful. -following above, could a ""comparison"" tool be added? Thank you!",3
1925,io.yuka.android,I really like this app a lot.. but it has no scoring for foods that contain lectins ....,3
1926,io.yuka.android,Needs more updates on product barcodes but it's still good,3
1927,io.yuka.android,"Scans have been inaccurate, along with the products I have added myself. I scanned a container of tablets, and it popped up as deodorant! There should be an option to add vitamins in the food category.",3
1928,io.yuka.android,"I wanted an app to check for ingredients I avoid. This app requires an account to get past the login and will only let you add a dietary preference if you pay for premium. I dont mind at all paying for apps, but before I do so I want to test it out. Without premium, scanning (only works on barcodes, not the ingredients list) will give you the app's rating for the product, the sources of which is explained in the 'Scoring Method' section. Not a bad app, just not what I was looking for.",3
1929,io.yuka.android,"I love this app! I even paid to be a member, however none of the member features enabled on my app. I will continue to use the app, but it would be appreciated if they honored the membership.",3
1930,io.yuka.android,"It's useful although unreliable. Some products on this app are apparently carsonagenic for example it says salicylic acid isn't very good and that it could be dangerous although there's not scientific proof it has any issues , a bit disappointed and as someone with Paranoia i know it would have me think my whole house was unsafe , I scanned multiple items and it seems to say that the only safe things to eat or drink is water and apples . Even if soemthing has other nutritional values",3
1931,io.yuka.android,"It's a good app, but it does not recognize the addative maltrodextrin. I have IBD and need to avoid certain additives and I noticed things that I have scanned that have it and it is not listed on the app",3
1932,io.yuka.android,why this app logo is kinda similar to FL studio's one 🤨🤨,3
1933,io.yuka.android,I love this app but hasn't worked for a few weeks. Keeps crashing the second I open it. Might have to request a refund.,3
1934,io.yuka.android,"I would like to know more about the ranking algorithm in use, how is natural spring water only a 71/100 literally no additives or anything negative shown... ant telling me my electrolyte drink is too salty is like saying the beach is too sandy... electrolytes are primarily different mineral salts. App does give an interesting break down of foods but i don't fully trust the ranking algorithm.",3
1935,io.yuka.android,"Informative app. Good for researching what is called food. However, the bias this app demonstrates by not giving information on the ingredients in dietary products/health drinks and mixtures is suspicious. Makes me wonder what's not be disclosed 🧐",3
1936,io.yuka.android,I bought the premium package. But i can not add unknowing products. Keeping takeing picture of the product for half an hour and nothing happen.,3
1937,io.yuka.android,Very good app. However can you add a catagory for added sugars since those are different from natural sugar. Would be nice also if you could work added sugars into your health scale algorithm. Also can you add vegetable oil to bad additives?,3
1938,io.yuka.android,It would be nice if they did not make you sign in.,3
1939,io.yuka.android,This app is great. I have been scanning everything in my house. It would be a five star if I could scan my cleaning products!,3
1940,io.yuka.android,"Helpful, but needs more items that are not already entered",3
1941,io.yuka.android,Great expect that I donated 10 dollars and I'm still not a premium member. Scammed me.,3
1942,io.yuka.android,I absolutely love this app but it's not launching on my phone. Anytime I try to open the app it closes.,3
1943,io.yuka.android,"Cool app, but it needs to rate ""fragrance/parfum"" or anything like it significantly heavier. Those are most often carcinogen, allergen, and chemical irritant containing cocktails of chemically derived additives that endanger people who have allergies and asthma. There's a reason entire shelves are fragrance free products these days.",3
1944,io.yuka.android,"L'application donne des indicateurs pour les produits alimentaires et cosmétiques, mais pas pour les produits d'entretien, quel dommage...",3
1945,io.yuka.android,Wonderful idea for an app. I would be happy to pay for the full version of this app if it was more accurate. Some additives that they list as NO RISK have many risks. Also they don't put much negative weight on high fructose corn syrup. Which everyone knows is horrible for your health. Scanned water case = 100/100 bottle =71/100. Same water. There are many issues like those. I hope they keep improving the information on this app because it has the potential to be amazing!!,3
1946,io.yuka.android,"It's a great app, but most of the products I use have a QR code, and Yuka/Scandit can't scan them. QR are everywhere, so this app idea is great, live it... but is coming obsolete.",3
1947,io.yuka.android,"The app is good but does not have many brands, especially Asian and Chinese brands",3
1948,io.yuka.android,"If it had the option to categorize your favorites into as many categories as you want (like Amazon's Lists feature), that would definitely help improve this app.",3
1949,io.yuka.android,So as far as the app goes. It's use is OK if your only looking for toxic chemicals. The app is not right when it comes to counting calories and saturated fat as bad. That's just ridiculous. It's the staple of a keto diet. Also it counts carbs and sugar as ok which again is ridiculous. These need to be changed. It's false info and people who eat a high carb high sugar low fat diet are extremely unhealthy.,3
1950,io.yuka.android,"I have a different country on the app on my tablet it gives me products from another country,language. On my phone it is USA products which is what I need,.",3
1951,io.yuka.android,Cool but totally bugged that it says polysorbate is safe... It's a known irritant and allergy to a lot of people. I'll stick to looking up products on my own.,3
1952,io.yuka.android,"Amazing app, although I would suggest you add a calorie per certain gram calculator. Basically let's say a product gives 350 calories per 100 grams and u have the same bar of chocolate except its 38 grams and u want to know how much calories that gives. Please add a calorie calculator function :).",3
1953,io.yuka.android,"I wish you could put in your own goals,, I'm trying to get healthier after an ed relapse and I'm struggling to eat anything. Everything I've scanned is ""a bit too caloric"" which is really stressing me out. Like pistachios are rated as excellent but ""a bit too caloric"" serving size is 150 calories which I think isnt bad for a meal but I don't wanna have any now because I don't know? Seeing that is causing me more issues than its solving so idk if I'll actually be able to keep using the app :o/",3
1954,io.yuka.android,Gives different rating for the same product.,3
1955,io.yuka.android,Very helpful,3
1956,io.yuka.android,"It's good but the problem is when I try to fill in information about something that is missing said information, It just shows a blank white page and nothing comes up?",3
1957,io.yuka.android,Who else is here from rugs vid,3
1958,io.yuka.android,"Items in my home rating 73 & 76 out of a hundred suddenly. Anything in cosmetic and food was between 20 and 55, and we haven't changed products yet. Has this app been bought out? I feel I can no longer trust this.",3
1959,io.yuka.android,"There is arsenic in brown rice, can you mention that?",3
1960,io.yuka.android,"Love the detail, however the need to scan a barcode to search means that it's next to useless for checking potential new online purchases. Barcode scanning should definitely be the default search method, but there needs to be a manual search as well",3
1961,io.yuka.android,It's decent but alot of unknown barcodes,3
1962,io.yuka.android,"I don't like that it takes points off for food that has ""too many calories"". That's subjective and dependent on the person who is eating the food. 100 calories for some orange juice should not deduct THAT many points. I do, however, like using this for cosmetic products. It's very helpful because I don't know the technical names for many of the harsh or toxic chemicals in a lot of hair and skin care items. I also like how in depth it goes in describing why the ingredients are bad for you :)",3
1963,io.yuka.android,Why the extra clicks to view additives? All on one page please 🙂 Not sure why a bag of crisps would score 72... Healthy junk food? Keep up the improvements and I'll probably upgrade.,3
1964,io.yuka.android,Let people try out the app first before being forced to sign in,3
1965,io.yuka.android,Just curious how long was this app under development and how big was the team? Seems good but I'm weary,3
1966,io.yuka.android,For cosmetics i strongly suggest the App INCI Beauty which I find excellent. Still experiencing with Yuka for food products.,3
1967,io.yuka.android,Great product. Difficulty in sharing with family and friends. No ease of use in sharing with family and friends.,3
1968,io.yuka.android,"I like this app but I wish there was some more in-depth info. For example, Frank's hot sauce was rated bad (32/100) and on yeah, too much sodium but it also says high in saturated fats and I'm looking at the ingredients off the bottle and I'm googling and I cannot find any saturated fat in Frank's. It's literally cayenne pepper, salt, vinegar, water and garlic powder. Where did saturated fats come from? Definitely makes me feel I can't trust the app....",3
1969,io.yuka.android,"I like the concept, but no.. I appreciate this app kind of doing what it says it is supposed to do. However people can write whatever they wish and that means biased opinions. Coffee & caffeine is not good for you. It is a marketing scheme which is why I quit Coffee and switched to MUD WTR. Be careful of this app. You should know if something is natural or man-made.",3
1970,io.yuka.android,There's a bug in the app please fix it,3
1971,io.yuka.android,The app keeps on crashing. Doesn't even open anymore. What do i do with my paid subscription now if i can't even open the app? I have tried reinstalling it and it does the same thing. Used to be such a good app. Very disappointed,3
1972,io.yuka.android,You need to pay a subscription this is facts.,3
1973,io.yuka.android,Just ok... I was scanning 3 dif flavors of juice and noticed the scores changing but all the amounts under the nutritional valued at the same. So it is a little bit confusing how they are scoring the items,3
1974,io.yuka.android,"I just downloaded this app, I scanned three items then I scanned organic bananas I just got, just to check out the app. Why did my banana's pop up as ""Iphone (Ramen Noodles Flavor)""?🤣🤣🤣",3
1975,io.yuka.android,"The app is simple and looks nice. My complaint is that I can't adjust how the ratings are calculated. I'm primarily focused on basic nutrition. I don't care about food additives, especially when there is no apparent basis for declaring them hazardous. I even double-checked some of them with the very organizations Yuka claims as its sources. Just because something didn't grow out of the ground doesn't automatically make it toxic.",3
1976,io.yuka.android,App takes very long to open,3
1977,io.yuka.android,"Entendu merci de votre reponse, au lieu de 15eur vous ne pouvez pas 10eur ou moins, plus de monde pourraient souscrire. Thanks",3
1978,io.yuka.android,"Sometimes it doesn't work when I do, it on very common items. I hope you guys can fix the issue. There is no other negative feedback :)",3
1979,io.yuka.android,"Great concept, but not enough data to be useful. I scanned about 10 barcodes in my kitchen, and only one came up with info. Maybe it's time to pay for some data entry instead of relying on crowd sourced data.",3
1980,io.yuka.android,Great for those that don't know how to read labels. Pointless for those of us that do.,3
1981,io.yuka.android,"Utile e preziosa. Non assegno 5 stelle solo perché vorrei che l'app migliori ulteriormente. Per esempio perché non rendere disponibile per ogni prodotto la scheda nutrizionale completa? Cioè, nel momento in cui un prodotto viene aggiunto al database dell'app, la scheda nutrizionale è archiviata anch'essa altrimenti il prodotto non potrebbe essere validato in base alla quantità di grassi saturi, zuccheri, proteine, fibre, sale e calorie.",3
1982,io.yuka.android,Good idea but a lot of erroneous scores. I've noticed a lot of mistakes in portion size so the app thinks that the relative weight of each nutrients is lower than it is in reality.,3
1983,io.yuka.android,"Good, but doesn't let me add an unknown syrup brand because Yuka somehow believes the kcal value is wrong.",3
1984,io.yuka.android,"Cool idea but if a product is not organic and absolutely 100% ""healthy"" for you, it shows you that it's considered a ""bad"" food. I scanned some low fat Graham crackers and they told me they were bad. I even scanned an organic breakfast bar and it came up bad. This type of stuff will give someone a complex! Lol 😂",3
1985,io.yuka.android,Not bad..but there are sertain brands that can't be identified,3
1986,io.yuka.android,"Great concept, execution could be improved. The scanner is very unreliable. It doesn't know if the picture is in focus or within a good distance, and it doesn't have an UI for me to help out. You'd need a lot of free time and patience standing in the grocery store trying to scan products correctly. At which point just Googling the product is faster. Also doesn't seem to work for non-american products.",3
1987,io.yuka.android,This app needs to be updated their are lots of food products.,3
1988,io.yuka.android,"Offline scans and searches are exclusive to the premium version - fair enough, but how about choosing a custom language for the app?",3
1989,io.yuka.android,"App works great usually when needed. However, some products aren't registered even with nutrition labels are clearly visible in photos, and when you try to report this, the email mechanism does not work properly and deletes your report",3
1990,io.yuka.android,"Perfect against junk food or dangerous cosmetics. But it doesn't check bad components in food suplements or drugs, i've been exposed to DHA pills containing titanium dioxide without realizing i was killing myself and it wont had happened if this app didn't refuse to expose those products too thus saving more lives.",3
1991,io.yuka.android,Helpful with most products I own so far but there are some that are not in the app. I have scanned and added a few so I like that feature and that they add it with the new info pretty fast. This app has informed me of ingredients I wasn't aware were harmful. What I don't like is that you cannot manually type in to look up products by name without using a barcode in the free version. Some products I look up online don't have an image of their barcode for me to scan.,3
1992,io.yuka.android,It is supposed to scan food but it sometimes says yuka doesn't rate this. I don't get it...,3
1993,io.yuka.android,Doesn't scan a lot of things better with scanning food then cosmetics,3
1994,io.yuka.android,"Requires an account. Sorry, no-go",3
1995,io.yuka.android,"Des fonctions essentielles manquent (classement, recherche, etc...) alors qu'elles sont présentes sur iOS.

L'équipe dit que les fonctionnalités arrivent, on verra quand...",3
1996,io.yuka.android,"Now, it is given me cosmetic products unrelated to the product, example jergens original lotion to shea moisture hair care products, sorry but unstalling, but on my other device it gave me the same product suggestions on different things I scanned for.",3
1997,io.yuka.android,"I like it, it's easy to use and quite nice to check products. It's heavily skewed towards organic products to the point that sometimes I wonder if it's totally fair. Compared two soy sauces, one organic, one not. Both have only one negative point listed: salt. Organic one contains more salt per 100g than other one. However, it's rated excellent and the non-organic one as poor, all due supposedly to lower salt content. I would suggest being more transparent about how not being organic is a minus.",3
1998,io.yuka.android,"When trying to add a product, i followed all instructions, then when when i tried going to register it, it kept telling me to check calorie to make sure it was accurate and it was but wouldn't let me get past that part, i continued to click correct, and it wouldn't go to the next step",3
1999,io.yuka.android,Why signing in? I wouldn't expect a scanner to to force me create an account or login using Facebook.,3
2000,io.yuka.android,"I love this app. It helps me make better decisions when buying products. The only thing I wish it would do is let you exclude ingredients. Fo example, I want dessert but it's labeled a 9/100 because it has too much sugar (Duh). I would love to exclude sugar content from scores or some ingredients that I made a decision about I want to include.",4
2001,io.yuka.android,"Updating my review to reflect the recent app update. It seems the data unavailable for common products was unintended and the developer was able to resolve in short order. I still stand by my initial feedback that showing nutritional highlights (additives, sugar, fat, etc) would still be highly beneficial to the user despite the lack of rating on certain product types. Outside of that the app works rather well, it's an easy interface, snappy, and saves previous searches which is a nice touch.",4
2002,io.yuka.android,"I like it, and paid for premium. However, I do think they need to work on the rating system. I think low ratings due to calories is all over the place, for example a fit crunch bar is 1/100 but doesn't have hazardous additives but they think it's too high in calories and fat so it's got a really low rating, but compared to other protein bars it's literally half the calories. I searched around and I'm seeing some inconsistent ratings of basically the same thing rated differently due to calories.",4
2003,io.yuka.android,"A very helpful app that is something I've thought I needed for years now. I would also say, be careful using the score to determine how healthy an item is, they grade 60 % of the score on nutrition, which sounds good, but then you see that vitamin water has a 9/100 score because it's ""a bit too sweet"" with only a single harmful substance, which is bad, but then you see Mountain Dew getting a 34/100 despite having over 3 hazardous additives. Other than that, it works very well, just as expected",4
2004,io.yuka.android,"I LOVE this app!! It's helped me so much with cutting all the junk our if my life and all it takes is a quick scan. I love that they provide articles as to why the additives are bad instead of just saying so, so you can be more informed of what you are consuming. The developers also get back to you super quick when it comes to adding new products. My only ""complaint"" is that I wish that they could expand to cover things like detergent and cleaning supplies.",4
2005,io.yuka.android,"I love this app! It's a very user friendly interface, no set up needed, and the features are very efficient and intuitive. My one real issue, is that it considers calories a negative nutritional quality. As somebody with an ectomorphic body type (skinny with a high metabolism), I NEED high caloric intake throughout the day so lower calorie foods are actually MORE unhealthy for my dietary needs. I wish you could customize your dietary needs because of varying body types which is why I rated 4/5.",4
2006,io.yuka.android,"This app is amazing! I do wish it had more studies in English as most of them are in Spanish, but translating with technology is not really an issue. You get everything the app has to offer without premium except a search bar, but you don't really need it unless you're trying to buy products online I guess. But you can scan anything in store and not only get information on that product, but recommendations for products better for you that are similar! Will be using for everything I buy!",4
2007,io.yuka.android,"So helpful when shopping, but also to go thru your cabinets and fridge. I'm learning more about foods and ingredients every day and this helps teach you what makes foods or cosmetics bad, and more importantly why. Had to turn off battery and data in the background though... My phone was getting very hot on charge and once I did that, my phone cooled down immediately.",4
2008,io.yuka.android,"I have been using it for almost 2 years now, and it helped my family a lot to stay away from all those aditives and other bad stuff they put in the food.I would give 5 stars, but.... the only problem with this app is that some products are healthy according to this app, but when you look at the ingredients list, some of them contain bioengineered food ingredients, and the app doesn't recognize that!!!",4
2009,io.yuka.android,"I love this app! It takes the guess work out of trying to understand labels, and what food/cosmetics are good or harmful to us. I went through my kitchen and bathroom cabinets and was appalled to see what I've been using that is full of chemicals. Even the lotion my dermatologist recommended is harmful. I only wish it could work by searching for an item by name, as many of the bar codes are on the packaging that gets thrown away. But I love that it gives you suggestions for healthier products",4
2010,io.yuka.android,"Love this app! Only reason for not getting 5 stars is that when you enable the search option, the items you search for do not get put on your list like the scanned items do. Also the scanner for the barcodes is always severely dark even in well lit areas.",4
2011,io.yuka.android,"Love it. Easy to use and is very informative. FEEDBACK: Let me search individual ingredients from products that you don't provide info for. Also, the nutrition rating system is flawed and doesn't appropriately evaluate density of nutrition in serving sizes. If a serving size is really small, of course it's ok to have a little sugar or salt.",4
2012,io.yuka.android,"I have a love/hate relationship with this app... because it tells me what products are good to eat, and which ones are bad, and I'm shocked to find so many of the products I have known, trusted and eaten for most of my life contain hazardous ingredients! So I've drastically had to change what I buy. I can't believe how many products on the shelves contain carcinogens and other ingredients that can damage organs, genetic alterations and allergins! 😲😡 Thanks Yuka for exposing this!!! 👍",4
2013,io.yuka.android,"Intuitive and easy to use. I have tried a few similar apps and Yuka is first to recognise almost all scans. I wish future updates will add more emphasis on upf ingredients and perhaps some features for people wanting to avoid ultra processed foods. Also, I hope adding new products will become easier in the future. Great effort and I have subscribed for $30.",4
2014,io.yuka.android,What an eye opener this app is. Most of us realise we're eating badly and can make good choices here but cosmetics has ingredients I've never heard of. Some of my favourite products are scoring poor so I've pushed back on them for feedback on why they use certain ingredients that their competitors in the same space don't. Very interesting app! Update: I've found some 'risks' to not be valid. For what I thought was a good app will drive you mad as even the 'good stuff' is no good,4
2015,io.yuka.android,Love this app! It's great being able to scan products before purchasing to see how good they are for you and if there are any risky ingredients. Would give it 5 stars if you're able to fix the minor camera but where it goes blurry and doesn't scan when trying to scan multiple products,4
2016,io.yuka.android,"Overall great. But I have some issues with the food rating system. It rates things based on general and sometimes misleading standards. Such as fat, salt, sugar = bad. Not concerned about fats as much as sugar or seed oils, and other harmful additives. Coconut oil is ""bad"" but processed cold cereal is ""good"" because it's low in fat, salt, or sugar? I realize it's difficult to rate food based on different needs. Some of the rating are inconsistent, so i don't trust the food ratings.",4
2017,io.yuka.android,A nice app which gives your a lot of details about the food you eat just by scanning the barcode. It should not be used as the end all decision maker since some information is lacking such as sourcing and it is very tough on fat but overall a great way to see additives and sugar content.,4
2018,io.yuka.android,This is good and I like that I can scan the bar code to figure out and get more information and the ingredients. I wish that you would recommend more non-plastic option or be able to look only non-plastic option but other then that it great. I will continue to use.,4
2019,io.yuka.android,Really like this app but when it gives recommendations for other products that are better it gives products that aren't like the original product. Or they show a product that is similar but no options for anything with a similar scent. Also some products are unrated and I'm not sure I understand that.,4
2020,io.yuka.android,"This is the most useful apps out, it truly gives consumers the power of choice (because this country doesn't care that we are getting cancer from all types of sources, like food & personal hygiene products. I tell you what, if you do not use this app, you may end up regretting it. There are so many hazards in things & the government just allows it all.",4
2021,io.yuka.android,I'd like to make a suggestion and be able to filter to the country where you can purchase products. I see a lot of products which are unavailable in the UK. I think that if you can filter by country then this would help sieve through products more efficiently.,4
2022,io.yuka.android,So far it's been really helpful in picking the right cosmetics and body products. Helped me to see the poisons they add into fish like crab cakes and shrimp. I wish a vegan option could be added for beauty products.,4
2023,io.yuka.android,"Won't allow the values as listed on the packaging label. which won't allow the product to be added to the app. I can only give the values as listed, and the app is saying that the information is incorrect. ?? Which is encouraging me to put mis-information about the product. Needs to be fixed.",4
2024,io.yuka.android,Great app Easy to use...but as with any tool it should be used with discretion. Coca-Cola scores 0/100...bad...but one cold glass occasionally can be uplifting and good...like a cold beer. Would love the app to include pet food,4
2025,io.yuka.android,"Excellent food scanner, it very seldom fails to get the correct product with all the associated nutritional content. Have you thought about maybe adding the ability to save the products scanned to a csv file to export to a spreadsheet? I'm thinking for keeping track of all the food in your cupboards around the kitchen and freezers",4
2026,io.yuka.android,"Great app, useful and easy to use. I have been able to scan bar codes of so many products in various countries and it works on most products.",4
2027,io.yuka.android,"A lot of products are missing, and sometimes it can't read the ingredients, still, amazing app.",4
2028,io.yuka.android,"Love this app!! Would like better if more additives, like alcohol and dyes. Perhaps specific to liver issues.",4
2029,io.yuka.android,"I like the app, but it is too limited on food preferences settings for special diets, such as a sodium free diet.",4
2030,io.yuka.android,"I love this app sooo much it helps me and most of my skin!, However the only problem I have with it is you can only search things if you have the membership. But I definitely recommend this app!",4
2031,io.yuka.android,"I like this app. Citations for the additives is brilliant and the app works flawlessly so far. My only reason for 4/5 stars is how additives, salt, fat and sugar are weighted. For example, Doritos and Orville popcorn both are ""bad"". Doritos had 10 additives and the popcorn had 1 (annatto). Setting preferences is in the premium version but it doesn't seem that additive-free or something similar is an option. If additive options are soon to be released I'd love to know.",4
2032,io.yuka.android,"I really like the app. My daughter takes it upon herself to scan whenever we go to the store, so it teaches healthier options to both of us. My only gripe is that there are not always alternatives listed when I search a bad item. Other than that, I really like it.",4
2033,io.yuka.android,"Fantastic app, but does need a way to add custom weightings.. eg as a diabetic id love to be able to weight sugar even harder than it is in the app... Also doesn't distinguish between good fats in say organic coconut flakes and bad fats. As others have mentioned would also be good to be able to negatively weight some ingredients that you were allergic to. I really should rate this 5 stars as it is generally an awesome app, but just a reflection that's a few extra features would make it +++",4
2034,io.yuka.android,"Love that it provides links to studies on the undesirable ingredients. Wish it didn't define things like butter as ""orange"" zone based on fat, as the body requires natural fats. Funny people like the Amish ONLY use butter and aren't obese... it's the seed oils and vegetable oils this app says are ""good"", but there's many of us who know that's wrong. So it's a great help, but it's not fully on the ball. It's a great app in the making and lots of effort has been poured into it. ⭐️4.5",4
2035,io.yuka.android,"I love using it.. but I would like recommendations on alternative products. Ex. Toothpaste, body lotion etc. Yes.. sorry, I did find the alternative brands.. thank you! 👍✌️👍",4
2036,io.yuka.android,"Pretty cool app so far, only concern is i scanned toothpaste with flouride and it says flouride is not a risk and gets the green light and i'd have to strongly disagree with that.",4
2037,io.yuka.android,I think this app is a great way to make better product purchases for our health. I do wish there was a version for animal/pet products as well as i wish the app would scan everything it says it can scan. I don't understand why som things can't be. Ex. Powerade can but gaterade can't why?,4
2038,io.yuka.android,"Yuka is great but in need of some improvements Being able to go out and scan food and beauty products for their contents and health impact is great. Yuka has helped me ensure that my diet consist of healthy foods that give me the energy to run and go about my day to day tasks. For Yuka to be a perfect app, there needs to be some additions to the app. - more consistent database - more product categories - better user contribution system, (maybe like Wikipedia) - an optional way to donate",4
2039,io.yuka.android,Great information. Love it! Would really like to have ratings on more protein powders.,4
2040,io.yuka.android,"Recommended in general. Easy to use and really useful. However, even though the process to add unknown products seems easy and straightforward, there's a big but, identifying ingredients from a rounded shape taking two pictures returns disappointing results. My camera app takes much better pictures of close objects than Yuka's. In addition, important parts of the previewed pictures get cropped automatically. Please consider investing more resources in improving this aspect.",4
2041,io.yuka.android,"Great app to quickly understand what food is healthy. I had some surprises after scanning products I usually buy and switched to different products. Suggestions for healthier products are very useful. It would be good if there was a way to see a list of starred products. If there is a way, I haven't found it. Very good app for cosmetic products, also.",4
2042,io.yuka.android,"Great app. Missing Compare feature. Sometimes I pick up two similar items (for example two types of milk) and although I can scan and analyze each, it would be great if there was a Compare feature where I could scan two items and it would show me their analysis side by side. Right now, I have to memorize the numbers of one and then compare to the other one. Thanks",4
2043,io.yuka.android,"Excellent app! The registration process is simple, with occasional bugs that are fixed quickly and with excellence by the team. One thing the app can use is an option to view the ingredients and allergens in the product. The usage of image recognition to text is helpful but also an option to view the original image. If this is implemented I will raise this to a 5.",4
2044,io.yuka.android,"It's good and useful, but I wish you were able to find alternatives to every item, not just the ones marked poor or bad. As I have things that are 54/100 but there aren't any healthier options because they rank it as good. Also, some of the alternatives make no sense. For example, I put in these oreo crumbs I was using for a cake to see if there was a substitute that was a bit healthier and all the alternatives were types of bread crumbs.",4
2045,io.yuka.android,"I really like this app and use it a lot. My main complaint is that sometimes the ingredients are inaccurate when they are printed in multiple spots on the product. (Such as ""active ingredients"" and ""inactive ingredients"".) When I try to report these listings, I often get told theres no problem, even though some of the ingredients are missing. My other complaint is that there are a LOT of duplicate, inaccurate entries by other users. It makes the search function frustrating.",4
2046,io.yuka.android,"Yuka is excellent at telling you which ingredients are bad and why. The recommendations feature now works for me and is very useful. However, the categorisation of foods as good or bad based on sugar/calories has the potential to be harmful. It would be great if they added a feature where you could ignore certain features (i.e. turn off the allergy function, since I'm not allergic to anything; or turn off the sugar/calories if you've had an ED). Overall, great app and I use it all the time :)",4
2047,io.yuka.android,"This app has the potential to change the world! It makes it super easy to evaluate and compare products. Its now in our hands to pick good products and force companies to sell better products. The only (major!) problem is that there are a lot of errors, which cripple the whole idea. It must be ameliorated. Otherwise, it's very easy to use and the bar code scanner is impressive. EDIT: I appreciate the reply, but it is not reliable, I'm sorry. As a consumer, make sure you double-check the nutritional values if you're basing your purchase on its rating. I am seeing a lot of nutritional values given for 100g that should be on 20g for example, dividing by 5 the fat, salt, etc. Dev, continue improvement, you have something great in your hands.",4
2048,io.yuka.android,Easy to use and enlightening. No ads! Changed out most of my skin care products. Paid for the premium membership too. Search function could use some tweaking for better results. Scanning the barcodes seems to be the best. Would like to see improvement on creating lists for swapping products. Right now I save everything to favorites whether it's something I own or want to swap for and both good and bad rated products. Recommendations are limited and I prefer searching for better rates products.,4
2049,io.yuka.android,"The app is great, I really enjoy using it! The database of products is amazing. However I do not get suggestions for alternative products anymore when I scan a product which is rated as bad (BEST PRODUCT RECOMMENDATIONS). The suggestions used to work, but only for a few weeks. I tried to uninstall and install the app again, but it didn't solve the problem.",4
2050,io.yuka.android,"Very useful and very well designed, also user friendly. The only reason I haven't awarded it five stars is that some times there are contradictions about the ingredients in one product, possibly uploaded by two different people, with one saying it contains a hazadous substance while the other doesn't. I didn't see that substance listed in ingredients when checking the product myself. So I gather that some sources may not be completely reliable. However, overall, I love this app.",4
2051,io.yuka.android,"A reason for the addition of the substances and the role they play, what they actually do would be an improvement to their descriptions. A great app that justifies it's ratings with peak body' review, grey article or liturature, which is a significant upgrade from standard review sites. Would be good to be able to create your own sub-categories within the food/beauty category's. Point and shoot scan with snap info, very easy to use.",4
2052,io.yuka.android,"This app is helpful. I recommend it. I just wish the app was more critical on harmful ingredients such as hydrogenated oils. My 70 year Dad uses the app now and won't eat anything that's 'bad'. He's eating sugar hydrogenated peanut butter and said the app said its good. It's a 57/100 but still green good. Hydrogenated oils I believe should be addressed in this app. I also think that seed oils such as soybean, canola, rapeseed should be addressed.",4
2053,io.yuka.android,Great app. I have the free version and I have no complaints with it!,4
2054,io.yuka.android,It's a little too low on the ratings.I like the healthy alternatives.,4
2055,io.yuka.android,"Loved it when it worked, but now it doesn't boot. Then it crashes. Not functioning yet. My wife is getting the very same problem.",4
2056,io.yuka.android,"I like the app and I have some suggestions for the premium features. 1. The ability to make lists of products and sub lists. 2. An extension to the premium membership for every new product entered. For example an extra week free for each new item entered. And an extra free week for each incorrect or changed ingredients detected. 3. The ability to customise the scoring, for example to ignore sugar or fat or additives, etc content in the scoring.",4
2057,io.yuka.android,"My best favourite thing. Love going round scanning the stuff I usually eat and drink and finding out about any hidden nasties. I have some decent knowledge of nutrition and some of the reasons for foods being ""bad"" are a little misleading, in my opinion. But overall it's really good and it will definitely help me make better buying decisions. Rating 4 and not 5 because I've had some problems with the all mulfunctioning.",4
2058,io.yuka.android,"I love this app, especially for personal care products, but wish it would point out GMO ingredients in all prodcts. Please consider adding this soon!",4
2059,io.yuka.android,I really love the fact I can scan and see the information about how healthy the products are. Comparing to before their datasets became even more big and accurate. I definitely recommend this app to other people! It's definitely easy to use as you need to scan the barcode and if they have it in their database they will directly redirect you to the detail page of the product.,4
2060,io.yuka.android,Update: adding products is a nightmare! Just let the user snap and crop the photo...the auto detection is terrible...loses 1 star Original: This app was a real eye opener. Love that it breaks down the individual ingredients and tells you in plain English why they are no good! The healthier recommendations are great! Just need to go check my local grocery stores to make sure these recommendations are available in my area.,4
2061,io.yuka.android,"I love this app it has been really helpful and has taken a lot of anxiety out of buying and using products that are safe. I especially loved the fact that I could find things I'm allergic to especially useful around endocrine disruption, as I have severe reaction. Sadly I was unhappy the the gluten-free, lactose and palm-oil detection seems to be removed from the app. I hope it will be replaced and isn't a permanent thing. Otherwise I would keep recommending it to people and rate it higher.",4
2062,io.yuka.android,"This app is life changing! I'm on a road of eating healthy and this app doesn't help me it TELLS me what is healthy for my body. I don't have to think, just scan. If my favourite foods are 'bad' it gives me healthy similar options!! I also love how EASY it is to add items to the system that are not haven't been scanned yet. Reason for 4/5: Sometimes difficult to get ingredients in the camera box, sometimes but rarely can't upload item even though it says item ready to scan. Thank you 😊 💓",4
2063,io.yuka.android,"Works great, just doesn't work on everything",4
2064,io.yuka.android,"Close but could be better. It would be nice to have more dietary preferences to customize in the premium version. Having the option to specify beyond what is available, like, let's say seed/vegetable oils. I prefer to avoid any fats that are not animal based, but palm oil is the only option given.",4
2065,io.yuka.android,"Great idea!! Just what nutrition needs: independence from companies. I would have rated it 5/5 if it wasn't for some mistakes. For instance, I filled the nutritional values of a product and it said it was not correct, tried it a few more times and nothing... But it WAS correct. Anyway, I guess it is nothing that can't be fixed... Hope it gets checked!! Everybody should be using this app!",4
2066,io.yuka.android,Great info. Makes ingredients lists much easier to digest. Really wish it informed about bioengineered ingredients.,4
2067,io.yuka.android,"I love this!!! This app will literally be my favourite thing ever!! But if I could suggest 1 thing. Would it be possible to consider an update to upload a barcode from our gallery? It would come in handy to check things we have saved previously without going to the grocery store, any barcodes relatives send through without wanting to download the app themselves (even though they should) and just in case your phone battery is on low and you only take a pic instead of running the app 🤣",4
2068,io.yuka.android,"I love the app. I use it all the time and even pay for the premium. I like that it gives me healthier alternatives. I wish it would show carbs in the nutritional information because that is something a lot of people track, especially if you're doing keto or you're a diabetic.",4
2069,io.yuka.android,Good app. Helps determine whether the food/drink you have is healthy or not and gives a good description of what makes it healthy or unhealthy. I have one problem with it though. I scanned a drink made of just fruit juice and everything about it was good but it was marked a 30/100 because it had 10 calories. I don't know if I'm crazy or something but 10 calories is not a lot for a good sized all natural drink,4
2070,io.yuka.android,"Recently found out I'm allergic to limonene, and this app has helped greatly with finding it in my creams, shampoos and makeup etc. Quick scan and all ingredients are listed from worst to good. I've thrown out A LOT of products after finding out how dangerous they are for my skin. Your skin is your biggest organ, be careful what you let it absorb. Will be scanning every barcode before buying. Just wish it could scan cleaning supplies as well.",4
2071,io.yuka.android,"So far I think the app is great! My only complaint is when I try to add a product that is not listed, it won't accept it. I'm only putting in the information I see and it's asking you me to make sure that what I put in is correct (it is). It won't let me do anything after that so I can't add this product, please add like a skip feature or something or an okay button to verify that what we put in is correct. Keep up the hard work thank you so much!",4
2072,io.yuka.android,"I like using the app. It is my 5th day so it is still early. However I find the process of uploading info about products that are not listed really difficult. Most of the time the app does not read uploaded pictures (I have a good phone camera) and several attempts are needed, which are still unsuccessful. 😔",4
2073,io.yuka.android,"Overall I enjoy this app. However, my biggest concern is when I scanned a type of protein bar it told me it was a poor choice but it gave me better recommendations. One of the recommendations was a ""RX bar chocolate coconut protein"". It said it was rated 90/100 and an excellent choice. Later I went to scan that exact RX bar the app recommended and it was rated a poor choice at 39/100. Makes me nervous about what other mess ups there are.",4
2074,io.yuka.android,"Love this app! One downside though: Some of the products I wanted to scan did not have a barcode, so I searched for them, but cannot add them to the list of scanned products (where all i own appears). I could add them to favorites, but they are not considered in the pie chart...",4
2075,io.yuka.android,"search hostory os missing, it would a great feature to add. otherwise it's just perfect",4
2076,io.yuka.android,"Simple, basic concept, AWESOME execution. It delivers on the food side at 6 stars. The only con is the beauty side ... most of my hair and skin products that I've carefully curated and love got poor to bad ratings exclusively for one particular ingredient that started with a ""ph"". Screw that! Not a fan on that end, but the food rating system has been an eyeopener and SUPER useful. Would recommend, highly.",4
2077,io.yuka.android,I love this app. I've discovered so many things that I eat nd use on my skin have additives that I shouldn't be exposed to. I'm changing my skincare routine and watching what I purchase to eat as well. I hope that eventually their library will be larger because some products are not in there yet. But most of the products I use are there. Worth the membership in my opinion.,4
2078,io.yuka.android,"I just use this to find ""hidden"" additives. I appreciate the in-depth info about WHY it's dangerous, and that there are different risk levels. Paid for premium, which has been worth it so far. Search can be a little wonky. REEEEALLY want to be able to access this through the web rather than only the app. Solid app with some room for improvement.",4
2079,io.yuka.android,"Good app, but it keeps crashing Tried 30 times restarted my phone 2 times and it wouldn't let me use it",4
2080,io.yuka.android,Nice to know what's good and not but you also have to take into account common sense of what your body needs more of rather than always what the app says.,4
2081,io.yuka.android,"Great app. Ive been having food sensitivities and its been helping me narrow down the culprits. I have to say though the replacement recommendations for foods are off. Recommending bbq sauce to replace hot sauce. Popcorn for every snack etc. Also, the price range of the recommended foods is high. Not everyone can afford a $5+ option to replace every food item the app recommends. Itd be helpful if low cost options were also highlighted.",4
2082,io.yuka.android,I've only used it a few times ( scanning things in our pantry). So far so good. It's interesting to see the good and bad of certain products. I just wish it had the feature to save items that are better choices to a shopping list. Would be a great added feature!,4
2083,io.yuka.android,"Great app! Edit: I can't delete any scanned product. The trash button doesn't work and the delete menu item neither, or it crashes the app. Edit 2: the app started behaving correctly after a while, now I can delete the scanned products.",4
2084,io.yuka.android,"Would it be at all possible to add a means of seeing an ingredient list of scanned products? As I have just scanned a drink containing high fructose corn syrup and the app makes no mention of it. Making me question the validity of the ingredients already input for the product. Otherwise an amazing app. Love it. Helps to make informed choices before checking out, thus, saving me money. Many thanks.",4
2085,io.yuka.android,"Only issues is there are some duplicates of the same product. That and sometimes a product will only have 1 ingredient listed when it's something like a sephora concealer which will likely have 15+. That's mostly users navigating the app so it's not a huge deal, but could be a problem later.",4
2086,io.yuka.android,"Very good so far. One bad point: when deleting an entry it does not delete the photo, and I cannot find the folder in my phone where the photos are stored to delete manually. Can you please include an option to delete media/photos associated to each entry to avoid clogging up phone memory?",4
2087,io.yuka.android,"I love this app as it makes it easy to know when there's products to avoid due to their toxic ingredients. I like my products to be in the upper range, at least over 85%. However, I have noticed that even the products that score high, often contain ""parfume"" which is highly toxic and rated in this app under ""no risk"" I find this disappointing to say the least",4
2088,io.yuka.android,Amazing concept - Inconsistent product info. The app is in serious need of curators to check that all fields are completed correctly. Many products have ingredients missing or names missing from products. This makes the search functionality a little hit and miss.,4
2089,io.yuka.android,I do not like that it requires email to register but the app is really good so far and easy to use.,4
2090,io.yuka.android,"Using this app became an addiction! I scan everything everwhere even my husband is tired of me changing all our food and cosmetic at home 🤣 but honnestly, this is a game changer, if everybody use this app all the companies need to change their formula for better product for our health. I really support this idea and also this should be more promoted in the web and in the media. Anyways I really enjoy using this app and I hope this will change lots of bad habits of many people including my self.",4
2091,io.yuka.android,"I like the app but the recommendations dont always load. Its also sometimes confusing because something like Sodium hydrogen carbonate (baking soda) makes a product show ""red at risk"" when really its not a toxic product. Maybe adding in a directory would also be beneficial. A lot of cosmetic apps are doing this which is nice. Anyway just wanted to make known about the recommendations not loading.",4
2092,io.yuka.android,"Great app, tells you which additives can cause you problems in food and cosmetics, used this to pick my shower gel, shampoo and deodorant today :) been using a couple weeks and love it, it could do with having a bit bigger data base but it's amazing for a small team!",4
2093,io.yuka.android,"Good for finding the chemicals in foods, which I appreciate. I hope in the future they can also let you know if the food has Bioengineered food products which I absolutely refuse to feed my family. So if Prego Sauce rates a 77, it is still trash to me because it contains bioengineered foods. I will eat a food with a lower score because of calories or fat before I will a food with a high score that contains bioengineered food products.",4
2094,io.yuka.android,"There needs to be a way to search for items, like excellent rated things to substitute when there isn't a readily available substitute recommendation. But also because many items came boxed, yet aren't no longer and the boxes are long since garbage, along with the barcode on them. Great and very useful otherwise",4
2095,io.yuka.android,"Love the app but there are a few bugs 1) there are sometimes duplicates for same items and have different ratings 2) when i tried to report that window opened i put my message in, hit send and... Was asked to open my mail app with contents of message gone so dont know if it was sent? 3) was asked to categorise an item to get better rated suggestions so i rated it as a fry sauce and ... It asked me to choose again but that option I chose was gone :(",4
2096,io.yuka.android,The only problem I have with it right now is that it keeps recommending me products from other countries (french products for example) that I won't be able to get – and I can't seem to find an area setting or something. Yes this alternative seems great but I'm not taking a road trip to france for it,4
2097,io.yuka.android,This app is pretty good. I love being able to scan stuff and see how good and bad it is. My only complaints are with it not having all the products I've scanned and it's alternate suggestions don't match the product sometimes.,4
2098,io.yuka.android,It's fun to see how all of the companies that provide us our needs have essentially let us down when it comes to healthy and environmentally friendly options in pursuit of cheap stuff. This app helps alleviate some of that suspicion by giving you different/healthier options that contain less additives and address the same problem. Beauty products have been the most eye opening for me.,4
2099,io.yuka.android,"The potential is high and undeniable, but there should be an improvement that would definitely make experiencing this app a lot better. For example, I'd suggest to add ""vegan""/""cruelty free""/""gluten free""/""bio"" etc icons and explanations to brands and products. As a consumer, I want to know if a cosmetic's ingredients are vegan and which ones, if a brand is vegan or cruelty free or if that specific product is. Same for food etc. And the quality of products should be defined by that, too.",4
2100,io.yuka.android,A nice app which gives your a lot of details about the food you eat just by scanning the barcode. It should not be used as the end all decision maker since some information is lacking such as sourcing and it is very tough on fat but overall a great way to see additives and sugar content.,4
2101,io.yuka.android,Great app. I have the free version and I have no complaints with it!,4
2102,io.yuka.android,What an eye opener this app is. Most of us realise we're eating badly and can make good choices here but cosmetics has ingredients I've never heard of. Some of my favourite products are scoring poor so I've pushed back on them for feedback on why they use certain ingredients that their competitors in the same space don't. Very interesting app! Update: I've found some 'risks' to not be valid. For what I thought was a good app will drive you mad as even the 'good stuff' is no good,4
2103,io.yuka.android,"Pretty cool app so far, only concern is i scanned toothpaste with flouride and it says flouride is not a risk and gets the green light and i'd have to strongly disagree with that.",4
2104,io.yuka.android,Great tool for monitoring what is in your food.,4
2105,io.yuka.android,I'd like to make a suggestion and be able to filter to the country where you can purchase products. I see a lot of products which are unavailable in the UK. I think that if you can filter by country then this would help sieve through products more efficiently.,4
2106,io.yuka.android,"Great app, useful and easy to use. I have been able to scan bar codes of so many products in various countries and it works on most products.",4
2107,io.yuka.android,"A lot of products are missing, and sometimes it can't read the ingredients, still, amazing app.",4
2108,io.yuka.android,Good ig,4
2109,io.yuka.android,"This is the most useful apps out, it truly gives consumers the power of choice (because this country doesn't care that we are getting cancer from all types of sources, like food & personal hygiene products. I tell you what, if you do not use this app, you may end up regretting it. There are so many hazards in things & the government just allows it all.",4
2110,io.yuka.android,This is good and I like that I can scan the bar code to figure out and get more information and the ingredients. I wish that you would recommend more non-plastic option or be able to look only non-plastic option but other then that it great. I will continue to use.,4
2111,io.yuka.android,"Love this app!! Would like better if more additives, like alcohol and dyes. Perhaps specific to liver issues.",4
2112,io.yuka.android,Love it but is it 100% reliable? Some results surprised me...,4
2113,io.yuka.android,Great app Easy to use...but as with any tool it should be used with discretion. Coca-Cola scores 0/100...bad...but one cold glass occasionally can be uplifting and good...like a cold beer. Would love the app to include pet food,4
2114,io.yuka.android,"This app is helpful. I recommend it. I just wish the app was more critical on harmful ingredients such as hydrogenated oils. My 70 year Dad uses the app now and won't eat anything that's 'bad'. He's eating sugar hydrogenated peanut butter and said the app said its good. It's a 57/100 but still green good. Hydrogenated oils I believe should be addressed in this app. I also think that seed oils such as soybean, canola, rapeseed should be addressed.",4
2115,io.yuka.android,It's a little too low on the ratings.I like the healthy alternatives.,4
2116,io.yuka.android,"Overall great. But I have some issues with the food rating system. It rates things based on general and sometimes misleading standards. Such as fat, salt, sugar = bad. Not concerned about fats as much as sugar or seed oils, and other harmful additives. Coconut oil is ""bad"" but processed cold cereal is ""good"" because it's low in fat, salt, or sugar? I realize it's difficult to rate food based on different needs. Some of the rating are inconsistent, so i don't trust the food ratings.",4
2117,io.yuka.android,"I like the app, but it is too limited on food preferences settings for special diets, such as a sodium free diet.",4
2118,io.yuka.android,Really like this app but when it gives recommendations for other products that are better it gives products that aren't like the original product. Or they show a product that is similar but no options for anything with a similar scent. Also some products are unrated and I'm not sure I understand that.,4
2119,io.yuka.android,"I have a love/hate relationship with this app... because it tells me what products are good to eat, and which ones are bad, and I'm shocked to find so many of the products I have known, trusted and eaten for most of my life contain hazardous ingredients! So I've drastically had to change what I buy. I can't believe how many products on the shelves contain carcinogens and other ingredients that can damage organs, genetic alterations and allergins! 😲😡 Thanks Yuka for exposing this!!! 👍",4
2120,io.yuka.android,So far it's been really helpful in picking the right cosmetics and body products. Helped me to see the poisons they add into fish like crab cakes and shrimp. I wish a vegan option could be added for beauty products.,4
2121,io.yuka.android,Love this app! It's great being able to scan products before purchasing to see how good they are for you and if there are any risky ingredients. Would give it 5 stars if you're able to fix the minor camera but where it goes blurry and doesn't scan when trying to scan multiple products,4
2122,io.yuka.android,"I love this app sooo much it helps me and most of my skin!, However the only problem I have with it is you can only search things if you have the membership. But I definitely recommend this app!",4
2123,io.yuka.android,"Works great, just doesn't work on everything",4
2124,io.yuka.android,Great app,4
2125,io.yuka.android,scan and get information about your food,4
2126,io.yuka.android,"Need's SOSO MANY MANY MORE PRODUCTS UPLOAADDED AND IDENTIFIED!!! THIS APP is way for Everyone and Anyone WHO CARE'S TO LIVE A FULLY FUNCTIONAL HEALTHY LONG LIFE!!! Mind, Body, and Spirit!!! Thanks to the Creators of this APP MUCH Appreciated!!!",4
2127,io.yuka.android,"Won't allow the values as listed on the packaging label. which won't allow the product to be added to the app. I can only give the values as listed, and the app is saying that the information is incorrect. ?? Which is encouraging me to put mis-information about the product. Needs to be fixed.",4
2128,io.yuka.android,Great information. Love it! Would really like to have ratings on more protein powders.,4
2129,io.yuka.android,"Intuitive and easy to use. I have tried a few similar apps and Yuka is first to recognise almost all scans. I wish future updates will add more emphasis on upf ingredients and perhaps some features for people wanting to avoid ultra processed foods. Also, I hope adding new products will become easier in the future. Great effort and I have subscribed for $30.",4
2130,io.yuka.android,More useful for people in this thieve's marketplaces.,4
2131,io.yuka.android,"I love using it.. but I would like recommendations on alternative products. Ex. Toothpaste, body lotion etc. Yes.. sorry, I did find the alternative brands.. thank you! 👍✌️👍",4
2132,io.yuka.android,Wish it also rated cholesterol.,4
2133,io.yuka.android,"I love this app, especially for personal care products, but wish it would point out GMO ingredients in all prodcts. Please consider adding this soon!",4
2134,io.yuka.android,Very useful,4
2135,io.yuka.android,I think this app is a great way to make better product purchases for our health. I do wish there was a version for animal/pet products as well as i wish the app would scan everything it says it can scan. I don't understand why som things can't be. Ex. Powerade can but gaterade can't why?,4
2136,io.yuka.android,I like it I'm learning it's quick and easy and I like that it will recommend and healthier choice,4
2137,io.yuka.android,"Loved it when it worked, but now it doesn't boot. Then it crashes. Not functioning yet. My wife is getting the very same problem.",4
2138,io.yuka.android,"Good app, but it keeps crashing Tried 30 times restarted my phone 2 times and it wouldn't let me use it",4
2139,io.yuka.android,It's okay. There are a few questionable ratings but usually ones rated low that really aren't that bad. Skinny Pop regular popcorn is rated a 60 even though it's just popcorn with a hint of salt. It gets you to think about what you're putting into your body though and rating monster energy drinks a zero makes me like them a lot. The app does have quite a bit against salt and will rate things very low for having salt like Himalayan pink salt walnuts at a 40 though its just walnuts and salt.,4
2140,io.yuka.android,"Would have been a 5 star but the logo a carrot and not a yuca, smh.",4
2141,io.yuka.android,"Need to add artificial ingredients, which are modified corn starch, high fructose syrup, anything that's modified, and then I would give it a 5 star rating",4
2142,io.yuka.android,Amazing app. Just one feature missing. Please add the chance to write a bar code if it cannot be scanned. This would be very useful for products that we want to buy from online! Thanks!,4
2143,io.yuka.android,"Fantastic app, but does need a way to add custom weightings.. eg as a diabetic id love to be able to weight sugar even harder than it is in the app... Also doesn't distinguish between good fats in say organic coconut flakes and bad fats. As others have mentioned would also be good to be able to negatively weight some ingredients that you were allergic to. I really should rate this 5 stars as it is generally an awesome app, but just a reflection that's a few extra features would make it +++",4
2144,io.yuka.android,"Excellent food scanner, it very seldom fails to get the correct product with all the associated nutritional content. Have you thought about maybe adding the ability to save the products scanned to a csv file to export to a spreadsheet? I'm thinking for keeping track of all the food in your cupboards around the kitchen and freezers",4
2145,io.yuka.android,"Plan on re downloading, just can't find out how to put this app in my wishlist",4
2146,io.yuka.android,"I love this app. It helps me make better decisions when buying products. The only thing I wish it would do is let you exclude ingredients. Fo example, I want dessert but it's labeled a 9/100 because it has too much sugar (Duh). I would love to exclude sugar content from scores or some ingredients that I made a decision about I want to include.",4
2147,io.yuka.android,Good,4
2148,io.yuka.android,"Yuka is great but in need of some improvements Being able to go out and scan food and beauty products for their contents and health impact is great. Yuka has helped me ensure that my diet consist of healthy foods that give me the energy to run and go about my day to day tasks. For Yuka to be a perfect app, there needs to be some additions to the app. - more consistent database - more product categories - better user contribution system, (maybe like Wikipedia) - an optional way to donate",4
2149,io.yuka.android,"search hostory os missing, it would a great feature to add. otherwise it's just perfect",4
2150,io.yuka.android,See if food is yuke or good,4
2151,io.yuka.android,"I really like the app. My daughter takes it upon herself to scan whenever we go to the store, so it teaches healthier options to both of us. My only gripe is that there are not always alternatives listed when I search a bad item. Other than that, I really like it.",4
2152,io.yuka.android,Great app. I wish it had information about cholesterol.,4
2153,io.yuka.android,You'll never enjoy food again...lol,4
2154,io.yuka.android,Nice to know what's good and not but you also have to take into account common sense of what your body needs more of rather than always what the app says.,4
2155,io.yuka.android,"I like this app. Citations for the additives is brilliant and the app works flawlessly so far. My only reason for 4/5 stars is how additives, salt, fat and sugar are weighted. For example, Doritos and Orville popcorn both are ""bad"". Doritos had 10 additives and the popcorn had 1 (annatto). Setting preferences is in the premium version but it doesn't seem that additive-free or something similar is an option. If additive options are soon to be released I'd love to know.",4
2156,io.yuka.android,"Love that it provides links to studies on the undesirable ingredients. Wish it didn't define things like butter as ""orange"" zone based on fat, as the body requires natural fats. Funny people like the Amish ONLY use butter and aren't obese... it's the seed oils and vegetable oils this app says are ""good"", but there's many of us who know that's wrong. So it's a great help, but it's not fully on the ball. It's a great app in the making and lots of effort has been poured into it. ⭐️4.5",4
2157,io.yuka.android,Great info. Makes ingredients lists much easier to digest. Really wish it informed about bioengineered ingredients.,4
2158,io.yuka.android,Eye- opening!,4
2159,io.yuka.android,I do not like that it requires email to register but the app is really good so far and easy to use.,4
2160,io.yuka.android,"Good for rating chemicals in anything but don't listen to it saying too much fat or calories in something, that doesn't matter. I wish it pointed out when something had rapeseed oil in it or other harmful seed oils. Plus the cosmetic side I wish it would mark down for fluoride on toothpaste, but it says fluoride is fine when it's not. So always do your own research ontop of using this app don't believe this to be divine scripture.",4
2161,io.yuka.android,The greatest application,4
2162,io.yuka.android,"As a pharmacist interested in organic products, I find this app helpful wrt to the additives and science referencing. I do think it could be refined wrt to the fat and salt content. Not all saturated fats are bad and sodium is not to be feared as maintstream would have you believe. Having said that, I am shocked at the number of additives in ""supposed natural "" products and have tossed away many items in my home. I will also message these companies to let them know. Based in Australia.",4
2163,io.yuka.android,Super app merci il serait bien de faire pour les produit chiens et chats car nos animaux sont en danger par l'industrie alimentaire animal.,4
2164,io.yuka.android,"Excelente aplicación, los felicito, me gustaría que pudiéramos colaborar introduciendo datos de productos comestibles para ampliar su base de datos y créanme que con gusto pagaría por ello.",4
2165,io.yuka.android,"Excellent app. there are a couple of things to add and that would be.. Searchable via type (chips etc), additives (show foods that only have no risky additives), alphabetical order or scanned date order.",4
2166,io.yuka.android,It should label the seed oils,4
2167,io.yuka.android,I really love this app! But I would love the app to have a laundry products and protein powders option! I will change my rating ;),4
2168,io.yuka.android,We have been using Yuka for sometime. I have notice sometimes foods get rated good when the ingredients may have a oil such as palm oil. Palm oil is not a good oil . Be careful when reading ingredients on items that rank good,4
2169,io.yuka.android,"This is a pretty good and easy to use app. My only gripe is that it won't list any negatives that aren't as obvious as something like ""too sweet"". I'm hoping that in the future, you can program detection for stuff like GMOs, aspartame, or bioengineered ingredients. Stuff that isn't as obvious as too much sugar or sodium.",4
2170,io.yuka.android,5 star app and function. -1 star due to 8 trackers in the app. Can remove Google app measurement trackers etc. Great app function and information,4
2171,io.yuka.android,I do wish there was an option to only have products for my country as it'd make it easier to find products when I don't have a barcode to scan,4
2172,io.yuka.android,4 out of 5 did not recognize Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,4
2173,io.yuka.android,"I learned a lot while using this app. I thought I was making good choices before, I had no idea how much green washing fooled me.",4
2174,io.yuka.android,"This is a great app, helped me get rid of products that were cause harm to me. it gives you a detailed explanation of what chemicals are in products and how they affect you. I would definitely recommend. however you can search for products which is a bit annoying.",4
2175,io.yuka.android,I love this app but it doesn't rate everything only food and bath room items but everything else is great.,4
2176,io.yuka.android,I think its sad that energy drinks are not Supported anymore. Please change that! Apart from that a very good app.,4
2177,io.yuka.android,"Honestly, fantastic app for what it does. Design on the application is a little meh.",4
2178,io.yuka.android,Perfection,4
2179,io.yuka.android,I wish it could scan more products not food related o tried a few things and love what I saw just wish it could do more,4
2180,io.yuka.android,"Great, I'm obsessed with using it lately. Gonna trash my entire medicine cabinet. Recommendation: the app needs a search feature. I have things that don't have the bar codes anymore.",4
2181,io.yuka.android,So many additives that we can catch with this app.,4
2182,io.yuka.android,"The app is great, but it would be amazing if you could flag products that have given you bad reactions so you could identify ingredients they share.",4
2183,io.yuka.android,Shows nothing carb related.,4
2184,io.yuka.android,It's a good app but not always accurate,4
2185,io.yuka.android,Great reference for foods unknown in our local stores,4
2186,io.yuka.android,very informative.,4
2187,io.yuka.android,This app is great but i can't log in on a new device. It allows me only to create a new account.,4
2188,io.yuka.android,I downloaded it again and I can't log in,4
2189,io.yuka.android,"Love this app! Only reason for not getting 5 stars is that when you enable the search option, the items you search for do not get put on your list like the scanned items do. Also the scanner for the barcodes is always severely dark even in well lit areas.",4
2190,io.yuka.android,"Great app to rate the goodness of products. Although some local products not listed, but can't be blamed because global brands are present. Quite intuitive and user friendly app, for cosmetics and food products. Highly appreciated",4
2191,io.yuka.android,"Close but could be better. It would be nice to have more dietary preferences to customize in the premium version. Having the option to specify beyond what is available, like, let's say seed/vegetable oils. I prefer to avoid any fats that are not animal based, but palm oil is the only option given.",4
2192,io.yuka.android,I open this app every time I shop for food and cosmetics l. I love it,4
2193,io.yuka.android,"Great app, tells you which additives can cause you problems in food and cosmetics, used this to pick my shower gel, shampoo and deodorant today :) been using a couple weeks and love it, it could do with having a bit bigger data base but it's amazing for a small team!",4
2194,io.yuka.android,"I thought I liked them but found not all scores are accurate. Like the last thing I scanned was purchased at the health food store - a jam made from strawberry (organic), sugar and that's it. It gave it a 4 and said poor and directed me to a PC brand that had pectin and other bad things in it bit it got a 6. Sorry that in itself tells me you guys must be making biased decisions when it comes to scores.",4
2195,io.yuka.android,Es muy útil aunque a veces se queda colgada la app y no reconoce los códigos.,4
2196,io.yuka.android,It could use some information improvements and the interface could be a little better for when you are trying to add information. It's a pretty cool concept though,4
2197,io.yuka.android,4 stars until you add carbs to the nutritional information. I need that being a diabetic.,4
2198,io.yuka.android,"Perfect absolutely lovely, but you'd get five stars if it became possible to change the importance of certain measurements (like saturated fats > salt or macros > additives), this app also needs to consider sugar more strictly for drinks imo. Another very welcome feature would be to ignore certain additives.",4
2199,io.yuka.android,it's a great concept and well executed. has lots of room to improve,4
2200,io.yuka.android,"Super legit. I've thrown out so much stuff; makeup, body wash, lotions, skincare, etc. It's easy to use, and I love that the app gives you alternatives to check out. I paid the $10/year to be able to look up items and I believe it was worth it. The only annoying part is the app can have difficulty scanning the ingredients on a product that isn't in the Yuka database. I've added 3 products myself and it took a couple tries to get it to focus on the list. :P check it out",5
2201,io.yuka.android,"This app is incredible...not only does it give you an overall score for each product, but it also breaks down each ingredient, what it is & level of risk to health, and then gives an explanation of ingredients that pose a risk-while citing it's sources! In addition, it will give you recommendations for swaps on items that have a poor rating, and break down the ingredients in those and save a list of everything you've scanned. My mind is blown. I've scanned my whole bathroom 😂",5
2202,io.yuka.android,"This app has made such a huge change in the foods we eat and products we use. I scan everything. It is so convenient how it breaks down what exactly is in the product, if it has risky additives, and the general nutritional values. I use the premium version and it is awesome how I can search any product without scanning, and it also recommends the healthier product and where I can get it. I don't shop without using it. I recommend this app to everyone.",5
2203,io.yuka.android,"Fantastic app. Get ready to throw some stuff away though. I really like that they have unlimited scans in the free plan. It's $10+ a year if you want to manually search products (for like an Amazon purchase) but it's worth it. I paid them the $10 not only so I could manually type in a search but because the app is so good, Intuitive to use and downright informative that I wanted to reward the developers and make sure they stay in business. Get the app, Free or paid. You won't be disappointed!",5
2204,io.yuka.android,"I love this app. It has benefited my health and peace of mind so much. I'm subscribed to premium and follow the email newsletters. Just some suggestions: add a grid view option along with the current list view, a social feature to connect with friends and see what they're scanning, and more labels such as gluten-free, grain-free, sugar-free, etc. Also, let us see the user uploaded pictures of the Nutrition Facts label and ingredient on the product's page in the app.",5
2205,io.yuka.android,"Love this app! As a diabetec, not only do I have to watch for sugar content in food items but also sodium as well. I love the scanner that allows you to scan food items & provides all the potential health hazards with additives on certain processed meals. Highly recommend it for anyone who wants to grocery shop for alternative healthy choice food items.",5
2206,io.yuka.android,"Amazing app. Really shows every ingredient and hazard, even breaking down why it's a hazard and the scientific research behind those conclusions. It will also show ingredients hidden under things like ""fragrance"" and ""natural flavor"". The number of carcinogens and endocrine disruptors in most of our everyday items is alarming. No wonder there's so much cancer and health issues in the modern western world. This app can really raise awareness and I couldn't recommend it enough.",5
2207,io.yuka.android,"App crashes after a few seconds of opening up. On Galaxy s22 ultra. Other phone (iPhone 14 iOS 16) won't scan anything. Camera opens up but when presented a barcode. It scans it, and a white box appears from the bottom of the screen and disappears. No information is shown from the prodict. Now works according to developer and testing it.",5
2208,io.yuka.android,"Yuka is the best thing that's come into my life in the last year. I get overwhelmed by ""fancy"" ingredients because I don't know what they are and Yuka has taken the time to do the research for me. I don't buy any new products or food without scanning it. I just upgraded it too, it's not needed for the app but if I want to look something up because I'm buying it online, $10-$20 a year is SO worth it. Yuka makes going toxic-free bearable and easy! I hope they bring in cleaning products soon!",5
2209,io.yuka.android,"Great tool! I love that I am informed now and can make better decisions when I purchase something my body consumes. Super easy to use and even when something isn't in their database, you can add it and the turn around is pretty fast! A couple of suggestions though - I wish you could search individual ingredients as well, mark the products you actually use (not just search) & remove history you don't care to keep.",5
2210,io.yuka.android,What a great App!! I am able to review the foods I have been eating and make better choices. As well as verifying some of my staple were good!! What always scared me was all those crazy ingredients they add and just saying forget it because I can never remember what they were. But with Yuka it's as quick as a click of my phone to see if it's a good choice or not. It does the remembering for you and will explain in detail each ingredient. #1 App in my book!!,5
2211,io.yuka.android,"This app has changed my life! I have cleaned out my cosmetics drawers and tossed so many things that I have been buying for YEARS, never knowing how bad they were for me. I love the feature that gives you better options / alternatives. Another great thing about this app is that if you are buying a product anyway (for example, almond milk), there are always choices. This app just lets you pick the best one for you and shows you the ones that have the risky additives.",5
2212,io.yuka.android,Great app to find out what dangerous things are lurking in your food and household products! I love that it gives you recommendations for healthier options if you scan an item that isn't the best. Tons of features in the free version. I'll be upgrading to the paid version just to keep supporting Yuka! The paid version is pay as you feel/can. The lowest tier is $10 per year. A great value based on what is provided for free!,5
2213,io.yuka.android,I'm amazed by how easy this app is. Makes choices so much easier because you don't have to read the ingredients! I was shocked by scanning the items in my cupboard that I thought were healthy but in reality they have chemicals used mostly for preservatives and are actually bad for you. Everybody should use this while grocery shopping! Highly recommend!!!,5
2214,io.yuka.android,Get it! I used to think so my natural products were clean with no harmful chemicals. Never have I been so wrong in my life! This app is really easy to use with it's barcode scanner. I love how it also give alternative products if the product you scanned has harmful additives. Not all matches match the greatest for some products but that's ok. I actually found out that one of the foods I ate was giving me migraines. I was shocked when I read the additives side effects in the curry.,5
2215,io.yuka.android,"Super helpful app! I've been using the app for a few weeks. I have scanned many products at home, and at the store while shopping. There have only been a couple times when I found an odd result. Example: a microwave popcorn showed poor, but the same popcorn in a different size box showed good. Otherwise, it really helps point out the downside of some products I thought were healthy when they really are not, and better choices for many products.",5
2216,io.yuka.android,"This app has been super helpful when I'm in the store. It seems out products with harmful additives for me. It also breaks down the overall health of a product in a very easy visual way. So if ""too many calories"" isn't a concern of mine then I still buy the product. You can also favorite items which is super helpful for me to make a nice list of snacks I can buy in the future. Great app!",5
2217,io.yuka.android,"Mind blown. I have spent so much time in aisles reading labels to buy the best stuff I could find. Turns out everthing I put on my body is POOR! Even the ""all natural"" makeup. We're going to go get all new products now that we have the app to help pick them out. And it's so quick and easy. I love that the app is self financed and independent from all brands. There are no ads even if you do free version. The makers actually care about the cause. I decided to pay for the pro version to support.",5
2218,io.yuka.android,Such a game changer for me with leading me in the right direction to a better me. I've had this app for over a year. This past weekend I experienced an issue with a product I scanned one day and it said it was Bad. Looked at my log and noticed it was changed to Excellent 100/100. I was baffled because I made plans to return the item. I looked at the ingredients and only about 2% of the was in it was written down. So make sure you double check the ingredients! [ Clinique moisture surge 100h],5
2219,io.yuka.android,This app seems to be extremely useful when scanning products. I decided I liked it enough to pay a yearly subscription so I could search my own items without scanning. There must be an issue with the search feature at the moment because nothing will pull up and just says no results found. I do hope this is fixed soon or I wasted my money. 🙁 I will update my review if this issue is fixed. Update- the search engine is working now. Pleased with the apps performance.,5
2220,io.yuka.android,"It's so easy to scan the food and the layout is easy to read. I use it mainly for finding any harmful additives in the food, but it also shows ingredient content and whether an ingredient is well sourced. It also provides sources for why its rating ingredients a certain way. Overall, this app has been exactly what I've been looking for to make mindful food shopping easy.",5
2221,io.yuka.android,"I love this APP!!!!! It has helped me make much better choices as a consumer. I tell everyone about it each time I shop. As an Alternative Medicine student, I have become more aware of all the toxins in our food and daily products as well as all the negative effects these toxic substances have on our body.  The team is super responsive. Even if a product brakedown isn't available, all you have to do is follow simple instructions of scanning it in for the team to review it. It builds more data.",5
2222,io.yuka.android,"This is a super helpful and easy to use app while shopping. The numbers it rates foods can sometimes be misleading, for example, it says a That's It bar has too much sugar since it doesn't take into account that the bar also has the natural fiber from the fruits. However, it is super helpful it showing you any risky ingredients and I love how it explains why they are risky. I especially like using it to compare two different foods or beauty products.",5
2223,io.yuka.android,"Great app concept that is executed well. It helps me to avoid preservatives. In general, I strongly dislike it when companies put new or even existing features behind a paywall and was disappointed to find Yuka following suit. I changed my mind after discovering the new premium subscription is pay what you want at a minimum of $10 per year which I find to be very reasonable.",5
2224,io.yuka.android,"I am so glad a friend shared this app. I discovered some surprising things I thought were healthy - turned out to be the most unhealthy (I eat a lot of whole food and try to aware of the bad). The sacriest thing for me was to find out the huge health risk some of the ""healthy"" foods contained, like cancer causing agents or calcium loss or cognitive memory loss. It has been a real eye opener to see. I love that the app lets you know why it is unhealthy and gives you better alternative choice.",5
2225,io.yuka.android,"Wow, I'm really impressed! This is truly a GREAT app!! All I do is point my camera at a barcode and it does the rest!! It's such a simple platform that anyone can use it, stay healthy and one step ahead of being mindful of what's good for you and what's not. Each product is listed with each ingredient, categorized by its nutritional value and vice/versa hazardous value. It also suggests products of integrity, that are proven to be healthy and all around everyone-friendly!! And it's FREE!!!!",5
2226,io.yuka.android,"It doesn't recognize Everything, but this app has changed my life. I've spent so mich time, money, and effort trying to find the right hair and body products, only to discover everything I've purchased has been causing problems. I was shocked when I found products advertised as paraben free substitute with an equally harmful ingredient. And I am no longer using Bath & Body Works products. Thank you. This app is exactly what I've been needing.",5
2227,io.yuka.android,Its amazing what you find! My favorite part though is not the finding out that what I'm eating is mostly garbage apparently (sometimes regardless the label) but that it breaks down exactly why and lists specifically each ingredient that affected the score and its purpose. That coupled with immediate suggestions of a similar food item that's a better option. Fantastic app!!,5
2228,io.yuka.android,"So quick and easy to use! Everyone should have this in their phone. Just scan the barcode and it is rated between excellent and poor. If you come across a poor rated product, alternative options are recommened. Nutrition facts and ingredients are broken down health wise. There are also links that further discuss toxic substances. 1st app I don't feel the need to add or edit anything.",5
2229,io.yuka.android,"This app is fantastic! It found almost everything I scanned and even the few items that it didn't I was able to input. I am shook at how bad some of the things I have been using are. I am someone who tries to choose healthier items as well and I still had a ton of items rated ""poor"". I love that it backs up what it says too with why these ingredients are bad. I've learned a lot.",5
2230,io.yuka.android,"So far, I really like this app. It's important to know what we're putting in our and our children's bodies and this app does exactly that. I love that it shows the negatives, in detail, even providing data sources. One thing I wish it would have is more ""recommendations for alternatives"" because I've noticed many brands are not available in my state. Also, some things I scan have no information but only 1 or 2. Other than that it's great and I highly recommend!",5
2231,io.yuka.android,This app has changed so much of what we buy and consume. Love having something so handy to quickly check my items before I purchase. It gives you the information and you can make an educated decision. Don't be tricked by the marketing that makes it look healthy always scan it first! After using it for 2 weeks I can identify a ton of additives and hazardous ingredients that I can keep an eye out for things we already have in our cupboards. Highly recommend!,5
2232,io.yuka.android,I absolutely love this app!💗 I have always been very careful to read ingredients in food and personal care items but when scanning what I already have around the house I have run into unexpected surprises. I like how it explains why and gives me alternatives unless there aren't any better ones. This will help me make better choices as I run low on things. This may help me figure out which ingredient(s) I've been having reactions to because some things I thought were good apparently are not.,5
2233,io.yuka.android,"Simplicity to the point of elegance! Not only does it do well as it is advertise. But quick and without faultier. I was amazed at how well it worked and the immediate impact it had right away on my food choices. Some products that I had no idea even existed. Three scans in and I was sold! Excellent program. Good work, Thank you!",5
2234,io.yuka.android,My decision maker on what I buy. I use this almost every time I grocery shop. I stopped buying some things I always bought based off of how bad they were rated. I like that it has information on the ingredients side effects and nutrition. It shows alternatives as well which is helpful. Very user friendly. I've recommended this app to friends and coworkers.,5
2235,io.yuka.android,I loved the free version of this so I decided to see how much the premium version was. 20 bucks a year is not horrible at all!! Especially considering what it gives you. My teenagers are using this now and it has already help with their snacking choices. THEY love scanning things in the store and are EXTREMELY shocked by some items. My favorite part is that the app has no outside influence or sponsors!!,5
2236,io.yuka.android,"Honestly a great app :). Don't take the ratings as gospel since sometimes it'll mark stuff that's only dangerous in high quantities as bad when the product has very little of it. However, usually when I'm going through a new product I want to use I'll look up ingredients I don't recognize and this keeps everything in one place :) I don't mind it being a little bit wrong when it makes shopping significantly easier for me.",5
2237,io.yuka.android,"If you're looking for a fun way to spend a lot of time in the grocery store or feel really bad about the food in your fridge, this app is for you. We just scanned every barcode in our kitchen. We scanned every item before putting in out cart on our last shopping trip. We've already made dozens of permanent changes to our food choices. This app is a fun way to lower sodium and eliminate harmful food additives for our diet.",5
2238,io.yuka.android,"Best app out there!! The research that went into this saves so much time. I've been shocked at some of the items I thought was good only to find out they had risky or carcinogenic additives. I've thrown out many of my cosmetics and replaced them with simple, inexpensive ones that are already improving the looks of my skin. I've gone through my pantry as well and culled out many products. God bless the founders of this app, it's amazing!!",5
2239,io.yuka.android,"I don't enter a store without my bar code reader up and ready. Rarely doesn't have a product I search. I would love it for the products not available if they had a ""scan the ingredients list"" option which would then decipher the data and give a rating. Other than that I love this app and recommend to every one who will listen.",5
2240,io.yuka.android,Love it. I would recommend having a double rating system though. One for additives and the other for overall nutrition content. Reason being I'm willing to work my meals around something that might be high salt for one meal but I will not accept harmful additives at all. The only way to easily see the difference is to dive into the rating.,5
2241,io.yuka.android,"Awesome app. Here is a tip in case you don't pay the subscription and you don't have a product in front of you: Many stores online website show pictures of all side of a product packaging including the barcode. If your store doesn't have a picture of a products barcode, check other stores! Not necessarily a full proof work around for every product but its better then nothing.",5
2242,io.yuka.android,"This app has provided me with excellent information on products I buy daily. It's a real eye opener, to see so many beauty products, soaps, shampoos, can foods, etc. that have harmful/toxic chemicals. I've made some real changes and have stopped buying these harmful products! I will definitely keep scanning on YUKA before I buy! I refuse to spend my hard earned money on toxic products that are slowly killing us! 😤",5
2243,io.yuka.android,"Love this app! I downloaded it awhile ago from a tiktok, I didn't really use it till recently when my fiance & I got on a healthy lifestyle change. I have scanned products we used and it is so shocking what products contains carcinogens. Alot of items I thought were good were horrible, & shockingly some products were great. I also love how it gives recommendations for a better product! That's my favorite part. To the store I go!",5
2244,io.yuka.android,This app is awesome! I love that it lays it out and makes it easy for people to see what is in their food and beauty products! A lot of brands I've thought were crunchy have turned out to not be so honest! Scanned almost everything in my house and threw out almost all of my beauty products! Crazy! So glad this app exists! Download it and change the products you bring into your home :),5
2245,io.yuka.android,Putting the power back in our hands. This app has helped us change our diets and the items that we put on our bodies. We have changed out so much and been so much happier and healthier since. The suggestions have helped me pick out other items for a skin condition that I was suffering from and I haven't had ad issue since. Would recommend this app 1000000x over.,5
2246,io.yuka.android,This is an amazing app and I just found out it works on skin products and I've been looking for one when I already had the answer downloaded the whole time.i considered giving it a 4 because there are a couple of things I see from time to time that are missing and I need an app to help me while I'm taking supplements and sadly it doesn't evaluate supplements. I think it should because I don't know what supplements are good for my health but I love finding things that are healthy in a store.,5
2247,io.yuka.android,"This app is absolutely amazing! Being able to check grocery items for the healthiest one has always been a challenge. This app makes it easy by letting you know how good or how bad it is - and tell you the contents (sodium high, calories high, contains additives (some hazardous)). We are on a health food kick, and this app has been VERY helpful! Just recently found that I can scan toiletries and cosmetics like deodorant to see if they contain hazardous materials. Got great results as well!",5
2248,io.yuka.android,This app has really helped me make better low tox decision. I love the easy to understand scale and the fact that ingredients are listed with detailed info on why we should avoid certain ingredients. The links to studies just boost my confidence in the accuracy of the app. I hope to see the company expand to household products as well.,5
2249,io.yuka.android,"This app seems to be legit to me. I'm on day 5 of the 20/4 ""Clean"" intermittent fasting. I've used Yuka to help me select healthy products when grocery shopping. My eating window is 4-8p, and so far my energy levels have increased and I'm noticing changes in my body, feeling lighter and energetic. If I were eating junk during my 4 hour eating window, I'd probably feel awful. I mean, look at how awful you can feel after 3 unhealthy meals a day. Great app!!",5
2250,io.yuka.android,"this is the best app i've tested out of the three I tried. (better than redify and think dirty) It covers everything I've scanned so far, which the others didn't. It gives in detailed analysis of why the products are bad, and shows scientific resources, as well as shows good alternatives. I love this app and will use it for every shopping trip from now on, highly reccomended",5
2251,io.yuka.android,"This app tells me alot of the things I've wanted to know, however it doesn't always go too in depth but I think it's because they're still working on the apps. I'd like to see more focus on finding out pesticides used, seems like most products don't have any listed and the food ends up being rated ""safer"" than I believe it may be. Rated 5 stars because overall the app is great, I hope it gets developed further!",5
2252,io.yuka.android,"This is the best app I have ever used in my life. I absolutely love it. I recommended it to friends/family & now their using it. The app, scanning, ingredients list you can click on it tells you about each one & rates them, & even gives you better/healthier options you can purchase. I absolutely have zero complaints. The way they said it up the breakdown of the ingredients the links that they provide everything is perfect. This is the best app ever made. 1,000 ⭐⭐'s.",5
2253,io.yuka.android,"I love this app so much. I got recommended this app recently and as soon as I downloaded it I was obsessed. It did make me sad that most of my skincare products are actually bad or hazardous for me but I'm glad I know now. I haven't tested the food analysis yet but am excited to do so. I love all the features but I do have some recommendations. I wish it also included cleaning products. The alternative products could be updated, they are a bit inaccurate.",5
2254,io.yuka.android,"Love this App🌿It has truly opened my eyes and changed my perspective on checking food and products throughout my entire home, work, etc etc❗I love how the app has better, alternative choices in relation to bad, poor products/foods😀The app is also fun to use and very easy to navigate. I've shared this wonderful app with many to keep us all aware and healthy to the truth and deceptions in the marketplace, etc. When I shop I now scan everything like a undercover spy before I make any purchase😯",5
2255,io.yuka.android,Life Changing! This app will revolutionize the way you consume quickly and easily showing you products with hidden dangers. Upgrade for more features including the ability to look up foods and products. I cleaned a ton of junk out of my house and now use it to make sure more doesn't find its way back in. I can't recommend this app enough!,5
2256,io.yuka.android,"Ok I NEVER come to the app store to give a rating, this will be the first time ever. I saw this app on TikTok and i was curious so i downloaded it. The first thing I want to say is this app runs and looks incredibly clean. There is no confusion navigating. It's also fast. Scans a barcode without any hassle. You're never left there waiting for a page to load. I was impressed with how much it can actually recognize too. A great way to learn ingredients. This app is worth buying premium!",5
2257,io.yuka.android,It would be nice if I could somehow remove suggestions or flag certain ingredients as dangerous for me specifically. About a half of the suggestions for replacement products while not harmful for everyone would be deadly for me. Perhaps an added feature for later. I imagine letting users add certain ingridients to their own danger list would be helpful to multiple users. A second scoring system maybe based on allergies and dietary needs?,5
2258,io.yuka.android,"Amazing app! This app helps you make MUCH healthier choices on food and beauty items! I use it at home and while shopping! Loving it, using it and sharing it w friends and family constantly. I wish it would do the protein powders and energy drinks, maybe even laundry detergents, fabric softeners also someday. Thank you for making an app that is life changing for the better! FIVE STARS!",5
2259,io.yuka.android,"I have been using this app for about a year now. I don't shop without it. It will definitely open your eyes. Things labeled organic or healthy aren't necessarily free from toxic chemicals. It has helped me cut down on the things I buy. More money doesn't mean better for you. It also gives a better alternative if there is one. Only problem I have is that sometimes items are rated low due to sugar or salt and not due to toxic chemicals, so definitely look at why it is rated low. No more guessing.",5
2260,io.yuka.android,"I LOVE this app. Finds every single product I scan. I live in Australia but buy products from the US and Italy as well. Never ever did it say unknown or similar. The recommendations include Aldi products as well as more expensive brands. It's fantastic! And even though you can pay to have extra features, it doesn't have annoying pop-ups to encourage you to pay. If you try doing something that's not included in the free version, it simply says this is only available in the pay version. Fantastic",5
2261,io.yuka.android,"Review updated since there was a misunderstanding: the app does *not* consider trace amounts in the ingredients, and the products in which it did were actually incorrectly filed. This works well for me and I think it's the most meaningful strategy. Still, listing trace amounts could be a lifesaver for those with allergies. The app works well, although I noticed a minor issue with the camera on my Pixel 7 Pro: after a while it stops focusing on close objects until I restart the camera.",5
2262,io.yuka.android,"I've used the app for a short while but I can so far say that it's been exactly what I expected, it's easy to use the information and Ingredients explanations have been so helpful in eliminating harmful products some which I was actually shocked that had harmful ingredients in them. even though some of the features aren't available on the free version and require a subscription it's still a super great app to guide you through your make up and skincare shelves",5
2263,io.yuka.android,"Best app if you want to live your life as free of toxins as possible! We all know how difficult and time consuming it is to read the ingredient labels and discern what it is good for you and what it is not. After using this app for a while, I joined as a member because in many supermarkets there is no network connection and therefore I couldn't scan the items to make better purchase decisions. It was totally worth it ! Amazing value for money",5
2264,io.yuka.android,"What an incredible APP! I am on a diabetes reversal program, and the information your very credible application supplies has made it much easier for me to select foods which will improve my health. I have shared with others on the program and have received good feedback from them. It is so easy and fun to scan items while shopping. Many product labels give you the impression that they are healthy choices, when in fact they are not. Thank you so much!",5
2265,io.yuka.android,May just be the best app I've used. Informative is an understatement and the app is flawless. The scanner is sensitive and quickly scans things zero hassle (I even scanned multi-purpose spray for fun and it recognised it instantly but apologized for not rating products of that type... I still think it's delicious *jkz*). Seriously try YUKA (the app not the plant) and make living healthy ridiculously easy! P.S. found a cool feature that gives you alternatives to the products you've scanned!,5
2266,io.yuka.android,"Excellent. Find out how good or bad your groceries, cleaning products or cosmetics are. They give alternatives, but not always truly appropriate to the item scanned. But a really great help in learning what to use and more importantly what not to use. Enjoy.",5
2267,io.yuka.android,"LOVE this app. Takes the guess work out of trying to find hidden ingredients. Cant tell you how many things I have scanned that are labeled as whole foods or natural ingredients just to find out thats a bald-faced lie. Can't recommend this app enough. If you can, subscribe to support them. They are putting in the honest work to give us this xray vision to cut through the BS of advertising. Keep up the good work, my friends. I appriciate this app and you guys so much <3",5
2268,io.yuka.android,"Got to say, this is one of the very best APPs I've ever uploaded. Worth it! Now I buy my food products with YUKA! Scan in the bar-code and instantly know what is good and bad about the product of interest. I must admit, one item I always thought was good. Was really bad! Well, my health is more important than a product. Never again unless YUKA tells me it's safe! Thanks to all at YUKA, it's so easy now for me to know what I'm buying.",5
2269,io.yuka.android,"I absolutely love this app. It is the most helpful app I have on my phone. I use it every time I go shopping as I am always looking for the most nutritious items without the nasty additives, also in buying cosmetics I seek out the most natural products, as I have found that I am allergic to a number of additives. Yuka is my most useful tool, I won't shop without it now. Thank you so much for coming up with such a necessary app.",5
2270,io.yuka.android,"Love this app. Honestly, you would have never known how bad some of the food/ drinks that you consume really are for you. This ap does an amazing job explaining in detail of what foods are excellent, poor, or bad for you, it's very interesting to know, they even go in to crazy detail of Hazardous ingredients and exc... by the way, if you are a heavy pop drinker, AHA water is actually so good. 👍 is it rated 100/100 excellent 👌 :)",5
2271,io.yuka.android,"Love this app!! I ran around my house scanning everything! Some pleasant surprises, some disappointing surprises, and a couple of real eye opening shockers. I've recommended it so enthusiastically to everyone I know that I sound suspiciously like I'm part of some MLM scheme. (Just like I suspected the crazy lady who approached me in Costco to recommend it when she saw me comparing labels🤣) But it's AWESOME, and completely independent, no advertisers, no sponsors. GET THIS APP! You'll love it!",5
2272,io.yuka.android,"Simple Fast very efficient. I put half my shopping back when I first used this app It has changed my view on many products, and I do not need to spend time reading the nutrition value on the back of every product",5
2273,io.yuka.android,"Yuka empowers you to ditch the confusion and make informed choices about what goes on your plate and in your shower. Its dedication to transparency puts the power back in your hands. While it flags potential red flags and suggests safer alternatives, it's your personal needs and preferences that call the final shots.",5
2274,io.yuka.android,Best invention ever! Now I don't have to stand in the store aisles googling every ingredient! Amazing! Not only does it give u info on why an ingredient is harmful but also backs it up with links to the scientific data behind it! AND It also gives u healthier alternatives !! All products I consume and use are scanned on here b4 I purchase! This app is just amazing 👏 🤩 🙌 😍,5
2275,io.yuka.android,"Great App, i really like it. Just one thing, I am having a problem trying to add a product ( fill in information) for a product that has been scanned on your system but has not yet been rated. The fill in information button won't pop up",5
2276,io.yuka.android,"Life changing for me an mine, can't rate this app enough an will continue to refer!! Our diets have changed so much for the better seeing what's in our food using yuka, it's unreal seeing the breakdown of the ingredients an explanations of the stuff we can't even pronounce its actually shocking, yea I pretty much bake and make our own stuff now!! if this doesn't make you think about what you eat I don't what what will .. but it then give you healthy alternatives to get which is brill",5
2277,io.yuka.android,"Best app!!! I have been using the paid subscription for two years.. I use it daily. I have a few reasons to watch what I eat, and Yuka reduces my stress. I love that I can search by food type to pick which brand I want to purchase!!",5
2278,io.yuka.android,It's such a great app. It has really opened my eyes to how many brands use hazodous chemicals and ingredients. It has helped me reduce the amount of products I need to use and eliminates the confusion of buying healthy food without having to read the ingredients that make no sense to me and understanding the harm they could possibly cause. I have passed this on to all my family and friends who are also just as amazed and grateful as I am. Thank you Yuka 🙏,5
2279,io.yuka.android,"I hage honestly been using it for more than 2 years and I love this app!! Very useful. The only thing I think could be better is the ratings for Bad, Excellent, Good... like just because a product has an possible allergen that won't apply to a lot of people, that shouldn't make the ratings of the product go down so much in category. The rest is awesome!",5
2280,io.yuka.android,"Great app to help you choose before you buy. Unlike many apps where you can buy the pro and forget about it, this app only offer a yearly subscription, with 10M+ downloads, surely they could reduce the cost....",5
2281,io.yuka.android,This app has helped me to make more informed choices when buying food and beauty products. I have been able to better understand why my body reacts in certain ways when consuming particular products with the helpful information this app provides. Thank you for coming up with such a great app :),5
2282,io.yuka.android,"I've learnt alot, how bad my diet is. Also many toiletries and household items contain unsafe additives and bad chemicals. The ""optional"" tool, is useful showing better option's to buy. Thank you.",5
2283,io.yuka.android,"Great app to easily scan. Overall, excellent information, despite a few questionable cautions. Using this app as my baseline to determine the quality of my food primarily, but also of toiletries. Plan to be a premium member.",5
2284,io.yuka.android,This app is absolutely brilliant! I messed my family dinner up because I found myself running round the house scanning everything and then my wife joined me! Dinner was rubbish this app was great. I'll be recommending this to all my friends,5
2285,io.yuka.android,"I really love this app, been using it for a few years now. I always scan any beauty product like shampoo or body wash before making a decision. I really like that it explains what can be harmful and why and then sources articles, very responsible.",5
2286,io.yuka.android,"This app is the BOMB!! My husband and I always check ingredients and sometimes we can't tell if what we are buying has hidden poisons in it or not. You have made our shopping experiences so much better!!! If I could give you 10 stars, I would!!!",5
2287,io.yuka.android,This is such a great app! I have very sensitive skin and it is so helpful to scan different products to find out if they contain harmful ingredients I might be allergic to. I have shared this with a number of people and they all love this app! Thank you so much!,5
2288,io.yuka.android,Love the app. Not only will you know the risky ingredients in the food but the app almost always gives you a healthy alternative. I have changed most hygiene items and a lot of foods. I would love for the app to include an insect detector. I am certain I won't be happy eating zeee bugs. 😂,5
2289,io.yuka.android,Perfect guidance. I'm aware that what we put in and on our bodies impacts our health. There's no point shying from that fact. This app helps guide me when I'm buying new products for me and my family. It's also useful in helping me.make my children aware of looking at the actual products we buy and what they contain. Making them consider what we are putting in and on our bodies. It's important to question things and to look to understand what makes our bodies work better,5
2290,io.yuka.android,"Great experience so far! Of course, it's not 100% accurate, and you still need to take a look at the ingredients and make decisions based on the type of product... But Yuka speeds up the decision-making process for sure.",5
2291,io.yuka.android,Love it so far. I've been scanning all the kids snacks and quite surprised by some of the ratings of them. I will definitely not buy those unhealthy snacks anymore,5
2292,io.yuka.android,"Several items say the are not rated, please rate supplements, protien powders, powder mixes found in these isles such as pre-workout, and more! This app is awesome. But I want to beable to see what's in my protien and other stuff I take. I ha e found that most of the ""healthy"" foods I've been eating has been 30/100 or 0 which is crazy. I love the alternatives selections that's awesome. This app could take on the broken food system we have in the usa.",5
2293,io.yuka.android,We love this being able to scan everything in our pantry (what a shock) how the product rated we are now in the process of replacing the bad items being able to scan before you buy is so good too opened our eyes to the world can't thank you enough,5
2294,io.yuka.android,I'm glad that I found this app. I just tried to scan my hair product and I realized that the chemicals in it cause cancer and recommend me healthier options. Best app on my phone 100/100.,5

2297,io.yuka.android,Hello Yuka. I just wanted to know can I blindly follow your suggestions? Bcas you look popular and I want to make sure before I use the product. I also want to know on what basis do you give rating to the product? And also can u recommend some budget friendly options when u recommend to use other products with more score.,5
2298,io.yuka.android,"This is the best app I have installed on any of my phones. It is absolutely shocking to find out all of the harmful chemicals that are in everyday skincare, cosmetics, shampoo, chapstick, etc. I never buy anything until I scan the upc with this app to find out what harmful, ingredients, if any are in the products that I am applying to my body.",5
2299,io.yuka.android,"The app works well with a wide variety of food and cosmetics. Not only does it give you information about the product, and tell you if it's good or bad for your health. But, also, it gives a detailed list of the different components and what's their risks along with the references. What I also appreciate is the fact that it can recommend you healthier products.",5
2300,io.yuka.android,Completely changed the way I shop for myself and my family.,5

2304,io.yuka.android,Brilliant 👏,5
2305,io.yuka.android,"This app has made such a huge change in the foods we eat and products we use. I scan everything. It is so convenient how it breaks down what exactly is in the product, if it has risky additives, and the general nutritional values. I use the premium version and it is awesome how I can search any product without scanning, and it also recommends the healthier product and where I can get it. I don't shop without using it. I recommend this app to everyone.",5
2306,io.yuka.android,Love this app sm,5

2314,io.yuka.android,"This app is incredible...not only does it give you an overall score for each product, but it also breaks down each ingredient, what it is & level of risk to health, and then gives an explanation of ingredients that pose a risk-while citing it's sources! In addition, it will give you recommendations for swaps on items that have a poor rating, and break down the ingredients in those and save a list of everything you've scanned. My mind is blown. I've scanned my whole bathroom 😂",5

I've recommended it so enthusiastically to everyone I know that I sound suspiciously like I'm part of some MLM scheme. (Just like I suspected the crazy lady who approached me in Costco to recommend it when she saw me comparing labels🤣) But it's AWESOME, and completely independent, no advertisers, no sponsors.

Just some suggestions: add a grid view option along with the current list view, a social feature to connect with friends and see what they're scanning, and more labels such as gluten-free, grain-free, sugar-free, etc. Also, let us see the user uploaded pictures of the Nutrition Facts label and ingredient on the product's page in the app.",5

We all know how difficult and time consuming it is to read the ingredient labels and discern what it is good for you and what it is not. After using this app for a while, I joined as a member because in many supermarkets there is no network connection and therefore I couldn't scan the items to make better purchase decisions.

2392,io.yuka.android,Easy to use,5
2393,io.yuka.android,"Amazing app. Really shows every ingredient and hazard, even breaking down why it's a hazard and the scientific research behind those conclusions. It will also show ingredients hidden under things like ""fragrance"" and ""natural flavor"". The number of carcinogens and endocrine disruptors in most of our everyday items is alarming. No wonder there's so much cancer and health issues in the modern western world. This app can really raise awareness and I couldn't recommend it enough.",5
2394,io.yuka.android,"Love this app! As a parent, it quickly opened our eyes and made us clear out the pantry. There's also a great story about the founders who are very inspiring. Paying the $10 to support the cause.",5
2395,io.yuka.android,Yuka is hands down the best app I have on my phone! I thought I had excellent sunscreens only to discover they are quiet bad for you to use! Finally found one which is good for your skin! Same goes for other skin products food and drinks things that I thought were good for you can be bad and things that I thought would be bad for you to use because they don't sport a fancy label claiming how good they are for you are rated excellent!

2400,net.daylio,"I AM SO SAD. I have my app set to auto backup. I recently had to do a factory reset and I didn't think to make sure it was actually backing up. It hasn't auto backed up for 40 DAYS. I've been using this app every day for more than 5 years. It's VERY important to me and I record many details and goals. I am incredibly disappointed to have lost 40 days. I had to go back and make stuff up, trying to fill in what I could. ADVICE - MAKE SURE IT'S BACKING UP",1
2401,net.daylio,"The app itself is great, but to access all your entries in a reasonable format you need to pay for premium... that was not well expressed. I feel slighted, and overall disappointed. I would not have chosen this app had I known that my entries would be locked down without premium membership. Advertise your product better... maybe I would have paid for it had I known up front.",1
2402,net.daylio,"Notes auto scrolling When adding notes to my day, it kept jumping to the bottom of the page, far beneath the last line of text. And I have to scroll back up repeatedly to see where I am. And I do mean repeatedly, it jumps to the bottom of the page between every word, if I pause to think for a second,.. All The Time. This does not happen in any other app. I have stopped the app, relaunched, reinstalled, and rebooted my phone, no change. This makes it way too frustrating to use.",1
2403,net.daylio,"App was ok. Until the developer switched me from a monthly to an annual subscription, complete with associated $20 plus fee, without my asking. When I contacted support I was told to check the fine print and that annual was a better deal anyway. Guess what - that's my call. I've cancelled altogether. It was for my child who used it off & on. *Edit• Response to below: it wasn't a free trial. Been on monthly plan for 3 months. How it switched to annual from monthly had nothing to do with me.",1
2404,net.daylio,"Super disappointed with this app. Don't get me wrong, I love the app itself, what I'm disappointed in is that all the sudden they are a subscription based premium. I purchased the premium/full version years ago and have been using the app for years. I went to add an entry the other day and it's telling me that my premium has expired. Disappointed and mildly disgusted that the developers would take away what I have already paid for.",1
2405,net.daylio,"My husband has been using the premium version of this app for years, so I finally decided to try it out for myself. I was planning on jumping right into premium, only to realize that they've moved on to an expensive $23 a year subscription plan. No thanks. While the app looks fantastic, without premium it lacks a ton of customization and gives you the constant reminder that you don't have it. I'll give my money to another developer that can accomplish the same goal without a subscription base.",1
2406,net.daylio,"I love the app and I've been using it for months now but I can't seem to restore my backup now that I've gotten a new phone which is really annoying me, especially since I've paid for the premium version. Hopefully it resolves itself, until then two stars. Of course I'm using a phone that is on the same operating system and account as my previous device. I can see my back ups but continue to get an error when trying to restore them.",1
2407,net.daylio,"I have been looking into upgrading to premium for a while now. I finally decided that the 10 dollars was definitely worth it. You guys even offered a great half price deal occasionally. I was very disappointed to see that now you guys have a subscription style payment. Before, I would have considered the upgrade, but not now.",1
2408,net.daylio,"That incessant ""Upgrade to Premium!!"" begging (multiple times every day) was vastly much MORE ANNOYING than the REGULAR ADS. Uninstalled. The only aspect that actually earned a star was how easily and quickly the user could make entries --AFTER spending a really long time initially configuring moods and activities. Disclaimer: I'm reviewing the free version of course. Having not paid for and evaluated the premium version, it might be a 5 star app. I've sinceforth gone for a different option however.",1
2409,net.daylio,"So, I went to add an entry and all of a sudden I have to pay to access anything?!? 😡 Now, fix it! (WAS 5 stars!!!) This app has been incredibly helpful in a few ways. For one, it reminds you to add an entry every-day which is very nice since I tend to forget. Second, it keeps track of my activities and moods, and the stats associated to them. Third, there are many different activities and moods that you can add! It helps me keep track of my bi-polar disorder, and all it's ups and downs! 👍😉",1
2410,net.daylio,"I was stuck on ""109 Days"" for like a week, and sometimes I would add an entry for some days and it would tell me I was ""missing"" the days. Not sure if this is some glitch that deletes your entries, but it got pretty annoying, and once I get to 150 Days I'm going to uninstall this app. It was good for the first 90 days, but now its just stressful.",1
2411,net.daylio,This is a true a time safer app...But thinking it could be more better if they have improve this app! Add a sleep timer & going bed timer routine....I don't like one thing which is they add planning travel thing but it will not remind you in which time to want to reminder rather than it will remind you after 1 year this is so disappointing!! I hope you will add some more fun activity timer & journals!!,1
2412,net.daylio,". Dimwitted program. Only a few characters are allowed to name goals. No search. Program doesn't give you even 7 days to define goals, keeps recycling back to ads, then the whole program breaks. This company is just greedy, megaphone-styled mentally materialistic. Look into Trello. You can do the free version. It's got reminders, archiving, and you can develop Trello into a whole system, even with pictures, URLs. Trello integrates with Microsoft Office 365 and MANY other programs.",1
2413,net.daylio,I wrote a review earlier but my phone broke again and this time there isn't any backup. ive realized how dumb it is that auto-backup is a premium feature or that they dont link your entries with your account in the first place.,1
2414,net.daylio,"Just make the program either free or a one time fee. I'm so tired of companies and their subscriptions!!!! I'd gladly pay 1 time, but I won't sign up to a subscription . Rediculous!!",1
2415,net.daylio,"I genuinely don't know why I kept putting up with this app for as long as I did. I don't want to buy your premium subscription to get access to features which should really be free for the most part. The constant popups and timers for sales is pathetic. And a betterhelp ad, really? I get you have to make money with this, but to do it in the way this app does shows you don't really have the user as the top priority... and for the kind of app daylio is, it's not a good look is it?",1
2416,net.daylio,"I would give this app 5 stars, but i just did a factory reset on my phone and i thought that I will get my data back when I do. Turns out you need premium if you want automatic backup. Really nice of you to tell me that sooner EDIT: yes I did restore my data, but Samsung doesn't allow third party app data go be backed up in Samsung cloud",1
2417,net.daylio,"I've been using this app for a while now and will continue to (as a premium user) because it is good but i must say that i am disappointed that they have taken a sponsorship from betterhelp, who have had a history of shoddy, questionable services that aren't actually good mental health help from qualified professionals and have the nerve to put it to even customers who have paid to remove ads",1
2418,net.daylio,What a waste of hard earned money. The app is trash. I downloaded a handful of apps similar to this one and this was the worst one in every way.,1
2419,net.daylio,"Seems the free version only allows for one goal. *ONE GOAL* One goal doesn’t need an app, and the only way to test it in any useful way is to accept the 7-day *free* trial, after which they start billing. I don’t know about most people, but I need more than 7 days to assess if something is having an impact on my habits. Pity, because it looks interesting, but the flagrant monetization shows where their priorities are. Not inclined to trust them with automatic billing. No thank you.",1
2420,net.daylio,"While the app is good (even though it has become bloated over the years), my main complaint is the revenue driven model they switched to. I bought a lifetime membership on iOS 5 years ago but after switching to Android I was told I cannot transfer my lifetime subscription even though I did it with multiple other apps. On top of that, they are justifying that a subscription model is needed to cover the running costs of an app that should be running everything locally (and using system backups)",1
2421,net.daylio,forced me to start the free trial instead of letting me use the free limited version for a while to see if I wanted to upgrade,1
2422,net.daylio,"There's no sense in logging so much information without having an automated means of querying it effectively making this app completely useless, like having a note taking app without the means of accessing your notes. This should have scheduled recurring data exports in standard formats like JSON, YAML, CSV but no such feature exists.",1
2423,net.daylio,"Used daylio for 4.5+ years now, disappointed that new update makes app harder to use - the text box is now less obvious than the audio and photo options (highlighted) and it's between them and the activities so i have to search before i can tap and type. Also the inane quotes are so annoying - give us an option to turn off! I go to daylio to record my thoughts, not read those of other people. It's been a great ride but i'll be looking for another app if daylio doesn't improve this.",1
2424,net.daylio,"I emailed Daylio twice, and received no response. The app itself is very useful, but they have an incredibly dishonest pay model. Over a year ago, they tried to upsell me within the app, promoting no ads. So I figured why not, it's a $40 one time fee. After the payment though, I found out that price is a yearly subscription model. A subscription implies new content and updates. They've ignored my emails, and I can't cancel anywhere, so I have to put a stop payment on my credit card. Total scam.",1
2425,net.daylio,"Great app, but the fact that premium features are subscription only makes this a huge 'No' for me. I'd have been more than happy to pay for a one-off upgrade to premium; shame. Update: in response to dev feedback that a lifetime fee is insufficient, given the type of app this is (a mood tracker), the possibility of new feature inclusion is insufficient to justify a subscription. I can get the whole MS Office suite on subscription, with 1TB space for twice what you want for a _very_ simple app.",1
2426,net.daylio,"There's a lot I love about the app, but also a lot I don't. The problem is I feel trapped having used it as long as I have. They allow you to create additional, custom moods, but they then do not support it within most of the functionality of the app and have said clearly they have no intention to do so. Further, with a recent update, they've really hurt their accessibility. Little things like moving the button to confirm things to the bottom right versus the middle make a big deal. Below - they say to contact them. Already did. That's where my notion that they have no intention to support this. Already tried. Removing a star for wasting my time with that generic message.",1
2427,net.daylio,"I had five stars before. Now, I have resorted to one because I backed up my recent entries of 2023 and when I logged in again, I saw that only May 2022 was available. Very disappointed.",1
2428,net.daylio,"Yup still bad. I want to love this but there are features you got rid of and it makes it WORSE! For example when I search activities and click on two, I want only those entries with just those two activities present to show up, what did you guys add instead but have everything show up and then have to click another stupid tab for ""Only selected activities present?"" I'm like yeah that's why I searched those in the first place! Also bring back fast scroll to the notes, photos and Save button!",1

I'm just not sure if this is the app to do it in anymore 🤬. Nearly 60 days in, I keep losing posts, you keep losing stars.",1
2432,net.daylio,I've had this app for a few years and used it quite a bit. Hadn't used it for a while and came back to see the developers had put many of the features that were once free behind a paywall. Another case of what was once a great app being ruined by greed. If the devs stopped pushing the premium mode so much with regular notifications about sales and pop ups in app then I would give at least 3/5.,1
2433,net.daylio,"[Feature request] Hi Daylio team! I love your app. I just have one feature request (will rate 5 stars once this is done) that I'm really looking for a journal app. I wish there is a look back feature where the app reminds us of an entry we've written far far ago. I love reminiscing my day whether it be good or bad. It gives me perspective. Like a time machine concept. It could be an entry from the same day years ago, or it could be a random entry 6 months from now. Please consider! Thanks!",1

This function is not something the average user can block. It is under the 'other' permissions umberlla and so it a security risk in my view. For something so private, I would avoid using apps that have anything to do with biometrics. It is inextricable from phone firmware.",1
2435,net.daylio,"Because of a bug I've lost a streak of 1453 daily entries. This happened 6 months ago and even though I contacted Daylio and provided all info and pics, they didn't fix it yet. So recently I reached out again to follow up and sadly I received a sassy reply saying that my problem is not a priority. If I only knew that I'd be treated this way I'd never have signed up for the premium subscription. Now I'm officially giving up on Daylio and trying different diary apps. I don't recommend this app.",1
2436,net.daylio,"Adding to the Notifications at Midnight? review. So, kudos to the dev for responding quickly. The response, on the other hand, is frankly insulting. Changing entry reminder times is NOT the issue, give us a *little* credit. I'm referring to the Notifications prompting us to subscribe and use other features. I CAN NOT change when Daylio sends those, and THAT is the problem. Of course I can suppress all Daylio notification sounds; why should I also have to lose entry prompts to avoid your ads??",1
2437,net.daylio,"I was using this app in my iPhone, it was perfect, I bought the premium version. Now I had to switch to android and I realized that not only I can't keep my premium subscription but what is way worse is that there's also no way of moving my data from one system to the other. I'll probably be using another app until you can solve the last issue, I'm actually really sad about this. Also, in the advertisement it should come with the warninh that it's forever only if you keep using android/iOS",1
2438,net.daylio,Gave it a lower score because it showed a ad despite me paying for the app. I really don't care who you partnered with.,1
2439,net.daylio,"i thought I'll be just paying based on the sale shown, i was plain stupid to trust the offer and not the numbers showing up on google play subscription. what's done is done, if it weren't for my saved money, my wallet account would be negative by now. I'll just use the subscription ((i PAID))) before the next one so I could just cancel it the day before the next purchase",1
2440,net.daylio,"It would have been 5 stars. Sending me notifications at 12am to pay for a subscription was the last straw. So much of this app is covered in subscription advertising, and it's infuriating. It's TOO MUCH. EXCESSIVE. Rude and inconsiderate to the human beings using the app.",1
2441,net.daylio,"Disappointing, I paid for the annual subscription, hoping to get some more insight into my mood cycles and after 3 months it just regurgitates the info I've put in with no data or insights whatsoever. Use a pen and paper for the same outcome and save your money.",1

Disappointed and will be uninstalling the app even though those months I had it were helpful.",1
2445,net.daylio,"Non-existent customer support. I loved the app but my notifications stopped working. The whole reason I used the app was because it reminded me daily to track my info. Without notifications I absolutely cannot remember, thus rendering the app useless. I contacted the developers THREE separate times to resolve it which resulted in long email threads of useless comments, and ultimately being ignored after requesting a refund. Awful developers and atrocious customer service.",1
2446,net.daylio,"Was a great app until it declared I got pay 9.99 to go premium or pay a subscription fee for exactly what I've been using for a year. Works fine but not worth paying for, it doesn't do anything, just mood icons, some activity icons and a text box to optionally write something. Definitely not worth it. Last year premium was5.99 for the benefit of more color themes for mood icons and auto backups instead of manual. Big RIP off now",1
2447,net.daylio,Bought the app and it magically forgot my purchase. That was two months of traveling down the toilet. Don't worry you can spend four hours finding the paragraph of technical support on this issue on the website before diving into your browser's cache and settings because it is impossible to find a support person or account manager to restore your purchase. Pay one time should not be the slogan.,1
2448,net.daylio,"This app was fine and fun, helping me to keep track of my daily life, but the big caveat is that it randomly pops up a message. If you happen to be recording video when this pop up happens, it stops recording. ""How was my day?"" It was good until the annoying pop-up stopped my phone from recording during my son's Christmas Choir Performance. Uninstalling.",1
2449,net.daylio,Wanted to try it first since it said 7-day free trial. Turned out it deducted my account for a one-year subscription. I reached out to their support less than 7 days of using it and they asked for my order number which got me hopeful they were gonna return my money. But I got no response from them even after following up. Poor customer service.,1

I have tried to export my entires...nothing. I DID NOT PAY TO LOSE ALL MY INFORMATION!!!!!! WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON WITH YOUR PREMIUM VERSION????",1

Too complicated to find a work around so I switched to MyAgenda which has full encryption of notes and Dropbox support that allows the user better control of their data.

2453,net.daylio,While I think the app is very affordable (if you want a membership) and I really like all the ways to track my mood- the deal breaker for me is that I can't use Daylio on my phone and laptop and link the two so that I can make quick notes on my phone wherever I'm at- but then be able to make longer entries to the same acct using my laptop.,1
2454,net.daylio,I first rated 4 stars. I have the paid version. I've requested support for what seems like a bug to me and I revived an automated response that was clear noone had actually read my email. This is very disappointing for an app I've paid for. As a result I will use it till the subscription is over but never renew.,1
2455,net.daylio,Tried the pro version its great very customisable but the summary and overview are awful which has resulted in me going to other apps sadly,1

2457,net.daylio,"I did not liked this app. After upgrading you are e hero and receive an superman logo, that is fool.

I really want to have my refund back.  thanks.",1
2458,net.daylio,I had this on my phone last summer and I did enjoy using it. I ended up going somewhere that I couldn't use my phone for 28 days plus I was in the hospital for 3.5 months before that and stopped using it since not much happened while in the hospital and I then deleted when I started a journal to write in. I'm very disappointed that now I'm reading that it's not worth it unless you buy the premium version. It was def diff when I was using it and didn't push a premium version on me.,1

This shouldn't be a subscription based app anyways, it's a simple tool To their reply- I never said it should be free. If it was a one time charge of like 5 dollars or so that'd be reasonable. reply 2- if your business plan isn't sustainable, that isn't the consumers problem.

2474,net.daylio,This just isn't a helpful app (for me at least) but one of the things that I don't like is that some times the first thing you see when you open the app is a advisement for premium.

2475,net.daylio,"It's a great app, and I would buy the premium if it was for unlimited time.

2507,net.daylio,Not helpful for me Sorry 😔,1
2508,net.daylio,I wrote a review earlier but my phone broke again and this time there isn't any backup. ive realized how dumb it is that auto-backup is a premium feature or that they dont link your entries with your account in the first place.,1
2509,net.daylio,Can't even make goals anymore without paying :(,1
2510,net.daylio,What a waste of hard earned money. The app is trash. I downloaded a handful of apps similar to this one and this was the worst one in every way.,1
2511,net.daylio,"It would have been 5 stars. Sending me notifications at 12am to pay for a subscription was the last straw. So much of this app is covered in subscription advertising, and it's infuriating. It's TOO MUCH. EXCESSIVE. Rude and inconsiderate to the human beings using the app.",1
2512,net.daylio,I counted more ads for premium than features for the app,1
2513,net.daylio,". Dimwitted program. Only a few characters are allowed to name goals. No search. Program doesn't give you even 7 days to define goals, keeps recycling back to ads, then the whole program breaks. This company is just greedy, megaphone-styled mentally materialistic. Look into Trello. You can do the free version. It's got reminders, archiving, and you can develop Trello into a whole system, even with pictures, URLs. Trello integrates with Microsoft Office 365 and MANY other programs.",1
2514,net.daylio,forced me to start the free trial instead of letting me use the free limited version for a while to see if I wanted to upgrade,1
2515,net.daylio,it asked me to rate it,1
2516,net.daylio,I can't believe you're putting ads in the app that I already paid for.,1
2517,net.daylio,"Disappointing, I paid for the annual subscription, hoping to get some more insight into my mood cycles and after 3 months it just regurgitates the info I've put in with no data or insights whatsoever. Use a pen and paper for the same outcome and save your money.",1

2519,net.daylio,"I had five stars before. Now, I have resorted to one because I backed up my recent entries of 2023 and when I logged in again, I saw that only May 2022 was available. Very disappointed.",1

2521,net.daylio,"ive been using this app for 1+ year, i treated it like my diary, i would always have entry everyday. i reinstalled the app and connected my gmail, my 400+ entries were gone and couldn't be recovered even with the app help, it sucks. i was in tears.",1
2522,net.daylio,"I genuinely don't know why I kept putting up with this app for as long as I did. I don't want to buy your premium subscription to get access to features which should really be free for the most part. The constant popups and timers for sales is pathetic. And a betterhelp ad, really? I get you have to make money with this, but to do it in the way this app does shows you don't really have the user as the top priority... and for the kind of app daylio is, it's not a good look is it?",1
2523,net.daylio,Gave it a lower score because it showed a ad despite me paying for the app. I really don't care who you partnered with.,1
2524,net.daylio,Don't bug me to rate your app,1
2525,net.daylio,Tried the pro version its great very customisable but the summary and overview are awful which has resulted in me going to other apps sadly,1
2526,net.daylio,"I've been using this app for a while now and will continue to (as a premium user) because it is good but i must say that i am disappointed that they have taken a sponsorship from betterhelp, who have had a history of shoddy, questionable services that aren't actually good mental health help from qualified professionals and have the nerve to put it to even customers who have paid to remove ads",1
2527,net.daylio,"it suddenly deleted everything, and I lost all important information I wrote 😔",1
2528,net.daylio,"There's no sense in logging so much information without having an automated means of querying it effectively making this app completely useless, like having a note taking app without the means of accessing your notes. This should have scheduled recurring data exports in standard formats like JSON, YAML, CSV but no such feature exists.",1
2529,net.daylio,"I would give this app 5 stars, but i just did a factory reset on my phone and i thought that I will get my data back when I do. Turns out you need premium if you want automatic backup. Really nice of you to tell me that sooner EDIT: yes I did restore my data, but Samsung doesn't allow third party app data go be backed up in Samsung cloud",1
2530,net.daylio,Asked support if they could reinstate the $11 premium deal I was advertised since it expired before I could purchase. They said no which is kinda BS because the price doubled since.,1
2531,net.daylio,They took $17 from me out of nowhere. I've been loving this app but this is enough for me to consider uninstalling.,1
2532,net.daylio,"This is a scam. It instantly asks you to pay 23.88, then continues to ask you. You cannot do anything else",1
2533,net.daylio,"It wont allow me to pay for premium even though there is nothing wrong with my account, bank account, wifi, or anything. And other purchases are working just fine but it wont let me purchase the premium.",1

2538,net.daylio,"I AM SO SAD. I have my app set to auto backup. I recently had to do a factory reset and I didn't think to make sure it was actually backing up. It hasn't auto backed up for 40 DAYS. I've been using this app every day for more than 5 years. It's VERY important to me and I record many details and goals. I am incredibly disappointed to have lost 40 days. I had to go back and make stuff up, trying to fill in what I could. ADVICE - MAKE SURE IT'S BACKING UP",1
2539,net.daylio,A free trial is not the same thing as free,1
2540,net.daylio,Stupid app and full of adds,1
2541,net.daylio,Beware! I cancelled my free subscription through the app at 6 days but they charged me the yearly fee and signed me up to the yearly premium against my wishes.,1
2542,net.daylio,Please update for tablets and foldables.,1
2543,net.daylio,"so I got this bc my friend has it but after I got it set up I got 7 days free but then $23.89 per year! I immediately deleted it do I gave it one star, U BETTER FIX THIS HABITICS!!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
2544,net.daylio,"Seems the free version only allows for one goal. *ONE GOAL* One goal doesn’t need an app, and the only way to test it in any useful way is to accept the 7-day *free* trial, after which they start billing. I don’t know about most people, but I need more than 7 days to assess if something is having an impact on my habits. Pity, because it looks interesting, but the flagrant monetization shows where their priorities are. Not inclined to trust them with automatic billing. No thank you.",1
2545,net.daylio,"While the app is good (even though it has become bloated over the years), my main complaint is the revenue driven model they switched to. I bought a lifetime membership on iOS 5 years ago but after switching to Android I was told I cannot transfer my lifetime subscription even though I did it with multiple other apps. On top of that, they are justifying that a subscription model is needed to cover the running costs of an app that should be running everything locally (and using system backups)",1
2546,net.daylio,"Because of a bug I've lost a streak of 1453 daily entries. This happened 6 months ago and even though I contacted Daylio and provided all info and pics, they didn't fix it yet. So recently I reached out again to follow up and sadly I received a sassy reply saying that my problem is not a priority. If I only knew that I'd be treated this way I'd never have signed up for the premium subscription. Now I'm officially giving up on Daylio and trying different diary apps. I don't recommend this app.",1
2547,net.daylio,Asking for a subscription for this app is criminal. Edit: I don't mind a fee to remove ads. It should not be reoccurring. Especially for such a simple app.,1

2554,net.daylio,"i thought I'll be just paying based on the sale shown, i was plain stupid to trust the offer and not the numbers showing up on google play subscription. what's done is done, if it weren't for my saved money, my wallet account would be negative by now. I'll just use the subscription ((i PAID))) before the next one so I could just cancel it the day before the next purchase",1

For example, when you start the application for the first time, the only ""social"" options are straight, heterosexual icons for activities which do NOT apply to me, therefore making it difficult for me to use the application. I couldn't find an option anywhere to ""add"" icons to the existing set either. Original: Why aren't there any LGBT+ symbols for people and social activities? Very weird.",1

2565,net.daylio,I have been a user of daylio since 2019. I am really disappointed in the way its heading. I really loved the memories feature but it got removed. The UI is annoying. The sharp colours hurts the eye. Dev. Pls don't make me switch after these many years.,1
2566,net.daylio,my progress of 3 years completely just reset..,1
2567,net.daylio,it has only one good part (goals) which has premium so pointless to install,1
2568,net.daylio,Almost everything is for premium! I hate the fact that you have to pay to be a better person for yourself!,1
2569,net.daylio,"It asks too many questions, I like the drop down notification where I can summarise the feeling for given day but I don't like that it doesn't submit when I press it, it just asks more questions and never actually record me pressing on the mood for that day",1
2570,net.daylio,"If you installed this it's probably because you want to take back some control, possibly in a depressive period.

2571,net.daylio,"Used daylio for 4.5+ years now, disappointed that new update makes app harder to use - the text box is now less obvious than the audio and photo options (highlighted) and it's between them and the activities so i have to search before i can tap and type. Also the inane quotes are so annoying - give us an option to turn off! I go to daylio to record my thoughts, not read those of other people.

2582,net.daylio,"Downloaded on my child's recommendation, as they've used it for a year or so now. I was ready to plunk down money, but not another subscription. I am *sick* of being billed for breathing. No thanks. Eta: I do understand devs need to eat. I don't mind paying upfront for a good resource. I mind the nickel and diming that's destroying the lower and middle class of America at the behest of corporations. I know the devs are subjects to that bs too, and here we are. Stalemate.",1
2583,net.daylio,Realised it wasn't free.,1

2586,net.daylio,"App was ok. Until the developer switched me from a monthly to an annual subscription, complete with associated $20 plus fee, without my asking. When I contacted support I was told to check the fine print and that annual was a better deal anyway. Guess what - that's my call. I've cancelled altogether. It was for my child who used it off & on. *Edit• Response to below: it wasn't a free trial. Been on monthly plan for 3 months. How it switched to annual from monthly had nothing to do with me.",1
2587,net.daylio,an annoying popup on this app demanded that I rate it. So I did.,1

I love your app. I just have one feature request (will rate 5 stars once this is done) that I'm really looking for a journal app. I wish there is a look back feature where the app reminds us of an entry we've written far far ago. I love reminiscing my day whether it be good or bad. It gives me perspective. Like a time machine concept. It could be an entry from the same day years ago, or it could be a random entry 6 months from now. Please consider! Thanks!",1

And I have to scroll back up repeatedly to see where I am. And I do mean repeatedly, it jumps to the bottom of the page between every word, if I pause to think for a second,.. All The Time. This does not happen in any other app. I have stopped the app, relaunched, reinstalled, and rebooted my phone, no change. This makes it way too frustrating to use.",1
2600,net.daylio,"Absolutely love the app. It's fantastic. Why am I giving it such a low score? Because they no longer offer the ability to buy the premium outright, as a one time purchase This feature existed before I started using the app. I know this, because the friend who recommended it to me, got the premium for a one time purchase, shortly before I downloaded it I appreciate that they offer a yearly subscription, but they keep hiking the prices up. If it goes up anymore, I will stop using it",2
2601,net.daylio,"I don't know if it's the app or if it's me, but I write up and entry, I put it in, right? Sometimes it either doesn't save or saves only the text. And if I didn't notice it and a day has passed, then the text is gone too. I lost a few entires this way with a TON of text, and at that point I already forgot everything I was feeling. Is it something with the notifications overriding entries or something else?? Would really like for this to be fixed because the app is great otherwise.",2
2602,net.daylio,"Thought this was kinda cool at first, but limiting the amount of feelings and goals you can add so harshly, and then tying up acheivements behind those you can't finish without paying was a huge turnoff. All the other payed content and ads were perfectly fine. Also, it would be nice if this app would ask you questions and help you form opinions about things. Simply adding custom activities, emotions, and goals doesn't really add anything contextually engaging to the user or anyone who reads it.",2
2603,net.daylio,"So, I had walked away from this app for a while, waiting for updates and a dark mode. It's come a long way and looks great. However, I am unable to use it.

2605,net.daylio,Premium way overpriced. No app on a phone should be $23 dollars a year for premium service unless it's making the purchaser money. There are 100s of apps that are free that have the same features you're charging $23 dollars a year for? Also least not forget the old fashioned was of opening a book a using colored pencils to track your mood and you guys just convinced me to do just that. Here's hoping you make tons of money off of others people's depression!,2

I was rather impressed with the app my first started looking at it; however, I have no interest in a monthly subscription for minimal functionality on an app like this.

2607,net.daylio,"I pay for the yearly subscription and I use this app everyday, it's not fantastic or anything but it gets the job done and I get to see the data I want to see.

I would definitely appreciate some of my money back since I was served an ad while paying for an ad-free experience. Doesn't make too much sense to me..",2
2608,net.daylio,The app is good but I feel like it could use some widgets. Like a list displaying all the 5 moods and then we could click on it and either submit it or like add details which would take us to the app. Another good one would be a list of goals for the day which we could check off. I like tracking my moods but sometimes the app tskes up more timr than it saves and its burdensome. Widgets could really help!,2

And what does “Activity Count” mean by itself, without comparing it to how often a given activity should take place? Nothing. And why on earth do I wanna know my average monthly mood? What would be really useful, it’s differential analysis of which activity affects mood changes the most. Without features like this, it’s just easier to have a spreadsheet: using a color coding, you’ll have pictorial rendition of your activities. Besides, sometimes the interface won’t do what’s promised. For example, I switched off pop-ups (Stats > Days in a Row > Hide), yet those annoying pop-ups keep on popping up every time I create an entry. Or another example: at first I set up reminders for some activities, but changed my mind afterwards, so I just turned them off (More > Reminders > off), but with no effect—they still show up as notifications. All in all, not a bad idea, some good realizations, but lack of analitics, too much just encouraging stuff, and settings that won’t work. Maybe good for beginners, not very useful for those looking to go deeper.",2
2627,net.daylio,"I used the app for 30+ days in a row. I liked it so much at first, i purchased the Premium version. Eventually, the reminders got too annoying. Incredible as it may seem, one can't customise the timeout, vibration, or even the sound of the reminders. But without the reminders, i end up forgetting to log stuff, which renders the app useless. So, i ended up uninstalling it.",2
2628,net.daylio,"Maybe useful for some but useless to me. I don't think I can summarize my days in overly simplistic mood ratings. It quickly becomes a chore, and an obnoxious one full of ads. It also gives you constant reminders even if you've already filled it out for the day. Pointless and annoying waste of time. If you want to keep track of your mood, just keep a journal.",2
2629,net.daylio,"Ok for inputting stats but useless for viewing data. Has a subscription based premium version that's advertised constantly in the app. I would've considered it if it was a one-off payment but a subscription?? Thankfully there is an export feature that I can use to analyse the data myself. Edit: I understand the need for revenue, but having a feature lockout while constantly teasing missing features *and* having a subscription model is too much. Ads+subscription to remove them is more reasonable",2
2630,net.daylio,"After a long time of allowing this app to annoy me with its completely tactless interruptive daily notification, I uninstalled it right now. Initially, I loved it. I love the CONCEPT of this app. And wanted to create one on my own. But I have a x100 better idea for implementing this. This is an annoying, interruptive, absolutely driving me crazy - pop up covers the screen, stops processes in the middle, even interrupts the keyboard while I am typing. Great idea, BAD implementation.",2
2631,net.daylio,Nice app. I realy like it but can't justify the subscription premium model. The regular cost is half as much as MS Office! I'd have been happy to pay a one-time payment to support the devlopers but the idea of subscribing to this annoyed me so much I looked for alternatives. There are so many. I ended up just using a Google Form so I can customize it and analize the data how I want.,2
2632,net.daylio,"A pretty app that promotes wellness... However, they switched to a predatory subscription based licence, for what simply is a glorified notepad. Can you really trust an app with your life's deepest moments with a dev that only cares about emptying wallets? It used to be a one-time fee, but became a subscription based product. I encourage all of you journalers to seek an open source alternative. We all know how this ends. You losing access to your hard written memories behind a paywall.",2
2633,net.daylio,"Nice app use it daily. Unfortunately customer service is terrible, DON'T UPGRADE! I've been charged 4 times for membership that hasn't updated to my app. It still wants to charge me. I've contacted Custer support and they've sent me a generic answer on what to do if I have changed my phone. I haven't changed my phone. I suspect the advice came from someone with whom there is a language barrier.",2
2634,net.daylio,"I really loved the app, but over the years it's become more and more focused on subscription users with ""premium"" Final straw is when I discovered to view your mood chart you now have to pay for premium. I got the app 3+ years ago for the mood chart as that is what it was marketed to use for. If you just want a basic app to record your mood and activities without viewing it in chart format or if you're willing to pay for premium then its a great little app. I'm just a little disappointed.",2
2635,net.daylio,too many ads and popups on free version,2
2636,net.daylio,"This app is great for recording your moods and keeping track of your progress, especially if you are in recovery or are healing from something. They have impressive features and have so much potential for more. I loved this app until I discovered that I had to rebuy it on iOs and restart all of my customizations from scratch. This fact is pretty obscure information to find. I feel betrayed. I wish I knew earlier. Otherwise 4/5",2
2637,net.daylio,"The app has ""mood tracker"" in the title and it says it's ""free""...it's not you have to pay premium in order to add, change, and delete moods.

Please charge it in the beginning so people don't get there hopes up for nothing, thank you very much!!",2
2638,net.daylio,"The ads are just so horribly intrusive and really get in the way of trying to use this app consistently. If there was the option of paying a one-time fee to deactivate the ads or buying a premium version of the app, I would do that, but all they offer is a subscription model, which is really frustrating, because it's definitely not worth it.",2
2639,net.daylio,It could be a lot better with prompts and diary portion. Personality self improvement portion. Exercise calendar could be separate and stats could be provided based on your age weight ECT. I just feel like this app doesn't offer much more than an easy interface to write down overall daily mood and some activities.,2
2640,net.daylio,"So I just downloaded this app yesterday, honestly kinda disappointed, like most of the stuff was premium, like if you want a more in depth chart to see how your moods are, it's gonna be a premium feature. Want to add more goals, premium. And I'm aware this is a free app, but most things you may need to keep track of your moods is premium, which as an Autistic person find this overwhelming because I can't keep track of my moods in depth.",2

2642,net.daylio,"Great app but unless you buy premium the constant pop ups every 3 seconds get annoying. I can understand getting ad revenue, but if you have an ad bar there is no need for 2 ad pop ups followed by a rate our ap pop up. If it was once when you opened the ap it would be ok, but its constant and annoying.",2
2643,net.daylio,"Great app, very well made and useful. One critical feature that's missing is a date range filter for your search functionality. This would be extremely useful, and shouldn't be difficult to add considering date info is stored alongside every entry. Will update the review to 5 stars if this is added.",2
2644,net.daylio,"Update: May 22. I would have expected more updates for a subscription based app. The features are lacking compared to some other apps like Bearable. Although you can add energy and symptoms as activities, this doesn't let you add the severity and track it on a graph like with mood. Mood can be effected by many physical and emotional factors and this app fails to let you do it effectively. I regret paying for this app.",2
2645,net.daylio,"Unfortunately, as I have been having issues with rapid cycling moods, the daily/weekly results have been rendered useless for me. Each day only really catalogs one mood, even if you be made multiple entries with different ones, so the weekly stats are often not even close to my true experience for the week. Luckily I got a paid account a couple years ago, but from what I've learned about the current subscription model, I'm pretty disappointed by this developer.",2
2646,net.daylio,"I started and paid for the app on iso. Now they are trying to get me to pay to use the Addroid version with insesent pop up ads and deal promotions. I wouldnt have a problem paying if that meant my iso and Addroid entries would merge, but they won't. I have to go back to my iPhone or backed up PDF to see old entries. Make them merge and I'll pay you again.",2

2648,net.daylio,"It's good in terms of personalize moods and activities but I've found that it's impossible to go back to the initial configuration once that you have started. Help it's not helpful at all. Restore and merge with other entries it's not possible. I've started with none groups configuration and saved entries. I've reinstalled the app to get the default configuration, with the last entries in backup. I started over, adding new entries, but when I've restored the last ones all new entries were gone",2

I've used this app for many years, and had made the lifetime purchase multiple times, only to have it?refunded for some unknown reason a few months ago. The app itself works well as a mood tracker and journal, but jeesus, it went from a 10€ lifetime payment to a monthly 3€. That is LUDICROUS. The ads used to be tolerable. Now they are really invasive. If I still had a REASONABLY PRICED lifetime purchase option I'd give it a 5 star rating...",2

2654,net.daylio,"Daylio In my opinion is a good app, so you are probably wondering why I gave it a 2 star review. It is not the app but because every hour I get an notification literally BUGGING me to 'eat healthy'. I set a goal for healthy eating and it tells me everyday to eat healthy and I can't get rid of the notification. Unless, I delete the app. So make sure if you ever get daylio, listen to me NEVER EVER put on notifications for that app. Its is annoying as hell and trust me it will annoy you to.",2
2655,net.daylio,"Very good idea for diary keeping app. But push notifications too annoying, and not enough preloaded activities. Too much effort to create new general activities that could have been pre-programmed. Uninstalling now.",2
2656,net.daylio,Initially this app was great but as soon as you finish the log in stuff you are immediately blocked from adding any goals or doing anything and have to pay. I was hoping for this app to be free. Only recommended if you are willing to pay the subscription fee.,2

2660,net.daylio,"Love the app. Managed to get the premium version while it was still a one time purchase. The subscription is way too high for an app that is basically done. What on earth is the ""team of developers"" working on when the app is not changing anymore??",2

2664,net.daylio,It's just a mood tracker with categories. I expected more from this app. 15 days of tracking and not much insight provided. You probably have to be really meticulous about tracking every aspect of your habits for it to figure out what impacts your mood.,2
2665,net.daylio,"This isn't really a journal app for journalling. It's an app to log how your day went in terms of good to poor, add entries of what types of things you did that day and add ""notes"". The notes space is not very inviting for full journalling. It wasn't for me.",2
2666,net.daylio,There should be more color options for moods. The list of features for premium implies there are more colors. It's misleading. I'm a little upset that I wasted money and didn't get the one feature I really wanted.,2
2667,net.daylio,"This app it self is amazing. I think it's really good at what it should, but my concern was about all my data that didn't save automatically.

2668,net.daylio,Probably a good app when it actually functions and sends me daily reminders on how my day has been. Also very annoying that the first thing that pops up whenever I open the app after a while is an ad with a 'flash sale' of its premium features.,2

2724,net.daylio,"So I just downloaded this app yesterday, honestly kinda disappointed, like most of the stuff was premium, like if you want a more in depth chart to see how your moods are, it's gonna be a premium feature. Want to add more goals, premium. And I'm aware this is a free app, but most things you may need to keep track of your moods is premium, which as an Autistic person find this overwhelming because I can't keep track of my moods in depth.",2

And if I didn't notice it and a day has passed, then the text is gone too. I lost a few entires this way with a TON of text, and at that point I already forgot everything I was feeling. Is it something with the notifications overriding entries or something else?? Would really like for this to be fixed because the app is great otherwise.",2
2729,net.daylio,"The free version didn't prove useful to me as it was severely limited. I am ready to mark moods and activities on paper sheets, just not to put up with the limitations of the application.",2

2731,net.daylio,"Absolutely love the app. It's fantastic. Why am I giving it such a low score? Because they no longer offer the ability to buy the premium outright, as a one time purchase This feature existed before I started using the app. I know this, because the friend who recommended it to me, got the premium for a one time purchase, shortly before I downloaded it I appreciate that they offer a yearly subscription, but they keep hiking the prices up. If it goes up anymore, I will stop using it",2
2732,net.daylio,"No way to automatically import old/third party data. Importing manually is theoretically as easy as editing a json but causes app to crash.

I got the app 3+ years ago for the mood chart as that is what it was marketed to use for. If you just want a basic app to record your mood and activities without viewing it in chart format or if you're willing to pay for premium then its a great little app. I'm just a little disappointed.",2

Can you really trust an app with your life's deepest moments with a dev that only cares about emptying wallets? It used to be a one-time fee, but became a subscription based product.

Mood can be effected by many physical and emotional factors and this app fails to let you do it effectively. I regret paying for this app.",2

One update truncates long journal entries and forces edit mode to read the whole thing which has added a hassle to explore longer thoughts forcing you to write your journal as blurbs instead of as a full journal entry. Team is responsive but at the moment I can't use daylio as my daily journal due to the way it truncates. :( bummer as I liked this app.",2

2767,net.daylio,"I don't like this app because I continue to have the damnest time with getting one basic feature to work correctly and that is exporting. See, sometimes my entries can get rather long in tooth because I just got a lot to unload at the time. Well these long entries cannot be exported in their entirety. It's like once the entry hit the bottom of the sheet, it simply cuts off. It does roll to another sheet or anything. It simply seems like the printer stopped printing and I don't know why. I only have this issue with my long entries. My short entries export to pdf just fine. I have contacted the developer several times about this issue over the years and still have not been provided with a solution that will allow me to export my entries from beginning to end. Even when I try to export my entries in batches of 7 days/1 week (which is the smallest batch I am allowed to make because the app doesn't have the function of exporting individual entries), my really long entries still cut off at the bottom. The entry does not continue to the next page. I for the life of me do not understand why. I have played with the setting in Adobe Acrobat, Adobe reader, and my printer. Nothing is working. Recently someone named Ivana responded to my latest email to the developers about this issue and she ends up sending me a 3 line response which included telling me is do an Advanced Export Backup. Huh? What is that? How do you do that? She didn't even explain how to go about doing this like am supposed to know what she is talking about. Her response was no help to me at all and just left me frustrated annoyed. Why can't I export my entries? There has got to be a way for me to export my entries in their entirety. And because no working solution has ever been provided to me in all the years that I have had this app (mind you I paid for premium before I found out this issue even existed) this is the main reason why I do not like this app. May have to switch to something else I guess.",2

I suspect the advice came from someone with whom there is a language barrier.",2

2787,net.daylio,Probably a good app when it actually functions and sends me daily reminders on how my day has been. Also very annoying that the first thing that pops up whenever I open the app after a while is an ad with a 'flash sale' of its premium features.,2

2793,net.daylio,"In the end of the day this app has turned out to be not very useful to me. The grouping of activities doesn’t do anything for stats. I made groups like “home”, “health”, “learning” etc., but the app doesn’t give me a picture how I am doing it these areas. And what does “Activity Count” mean by itself, without comparing it to how often a given activity should take place? Nothing. And why on earth do I wanna know my average monthly mood? What would be really useful, it’s differential analysis of which activity affects mood changes the most. Without features like this, it’s just easier to have a spreadsheet: using a color coding, you’ll have pictorial rendition of your activities. Besides, sometimes the interface won’t do what’s promised. For example, I switched off pop-ups (Stats > Days in a Row > Hide), yet those annoying pop-ups keep on popping up every time I create an entry. Or another example: at first I set up reminders for some activities, but changed my mind afterwards, so I just turned them off (More > Reminders > off), but with no effect—they still show up as notifications. All in all, not a bad idea, some good realizations, but lack of analitics, too much just encouraging stuff, and settings that won’t work. Maybe good for beginners, not very useful for those looking to go deeper.",2

But this becomes a MAJOR flaw as well because there is no way to Favorite, Organize, Hide, etc any of the sections in-app. Finding the data that I'm looking for is extremely challenging to me because I have ADHD and impaired memory. Please add this basic feature. As a temporary solution, I'm going to try exporting the CSV and use Sheets for this purpose. Hope that works! Otherwise, you'll love this app.",3
2801,net.daylio,"The app is very good at what it sets out to do. I like how deeply customizable it is (especially if you're not paying for it, you can still do a lot with it), and I find it very satisfying to summarize my day with the brain dump before bed However, it's really frustrating when I do a log of yesterday and then, tomorrow, get told I lost my streak because the app didn't save my log of yesterday. That is happening so frequently recently, and I hate it. I know I logged it, why's it not being saved?",3

What's the point of having several reminders if you can't add a custom label to each one? -- I see now thst, goals are reminders and reminders are...push notifications to use the app?

Do wish they had more options in their icons & fewer repeats.",3
2809,net.daylio,The pros: - Very customizable. - Good UI - Helps find patterns - Free version is fully functional. The cons: - Asks for a subscription for an app that doesn't provide any service or maintenance. Why should I pay monthly for a standalone piece of software? - Very intrusive ads for its own subscription upsell. - Does not offer a one-time purchase to remove ads or subscription upsells.,3
2810,net.daylio,I like it as an app but I struggle to make sense how to use it best for myself. I'm a naturally scattered individual and I rarely remember to use this in the moment and don't want to write a long narrative. Then other times I want to write a lot but I'd rather write it on a physical keyboard but this app doesn't support sync between devices easily so I can't really. Also I feel like theres a lot that could be done with the categories and stuff but I have none due to a blank slate effect.,3
2811,net.daylio,It's good and helps me as a bipolar person. However it's very limited on functionality unless you pay the expensive sub. This app is in no way worth $20 a year. I can't believe they switched from a one time payment to this ridiculous subscription. I'll keep using the free version for now until I find a better alternative. It's a shame because I would have been happy to pay a one time fee for the full version.,3
2812,net.daylio,Been using this app for a while but thinking of switching to one with fewer ads. Lately they've been flashing at the bottom of my screen which I find distracting. Not sure why they need ads after every couple entries in the journal plus flashing down below. I understand having some ads but this seems excessive. Not going to spend $24/year to remove them. Fortunately there are other good mood tracking apps without all the distractions. Kind of disappointed.,3
2813,net.daylio,They refuse to provide a web/windows 10 app. Myself and others have repeatedly asked for it. I paid for the full version but can't use it on my PC without BlueStacks but then sync doesn't work properly so it's pointless to do so. The website doesnt have a clear way to contact them on the landing page instead makes you search for it. Good app for the most part but lacking in the features I require.,3
2814,net.daylio,"This app is easy to use and I like that I can customize the activities. What I really do not like at all is that the push notifications actually stop other apps from working. It's one thing to notify and another to interrupt completely. I was in the middle of recording a dance practice and the push notification turned my camera off so I do not have that content now! Obviously I turned off the notifications after that, but none of my other apps have this problem. The thing is that actually I *would* like a reminder to do the entry, but not at the cost of interrupting my actual activities. Please fix this issue.",3

This app has lots of room for improvement but still a reliable and useful tool for mood tracking.",3
2817,net.daylio,"Torn between 3 and 4 stars - for most people I think it will be 4. It does not currently support bipolar disorder particularly well. The ability to add secondary tracks for each day would be great. I could then track depression, mania, and anxiety separately. This would be useful because the three can appear in any combination, and just one track cannot represent that.",3
2818,net.daylio,"I've been using this app for a while and really liked it. My biggest complaint were the ads that seemed a little intrusive with the way they are positioned so frequently in my feed. They stick out a lot from my daily entries. I liked this app enough to buy premium to get rid of ads...except when I did, I noticed my only option was a monthly subscription. Yuck. I would much rather pay for the app in full just once than pay every month. ☹",3

My habits and mood tracking don't go hand in hand (this might just be me...) but I'd prefer to use a separate app to track habits than use this habit tracker where I have to record my mood as well in order to track the habit. Icky and convoluted. But I still like the mood tracking aspect as it is.",3
2820,net.daylio,"This is an amazing app for quickly tracking activities and how they relate to your overall mood. The ingenious data input method is intuitive, extremely quick, and provides good data filtering tools. However, I believe that the app is severely limited for tracking sleep, one of the most important factors in determining our health and well being.  I have been forced to create separate icons for 5hrs sleep, 6hrs, 7hrs, etc, which creates clutter in the app and is not very useful for tracking purposes. They need to create a better method for tracking the amount of sleep you are getting. If they implement a better sleep tracking tool, this will become a 5 star app and easily worth the money for the premium version (which I've already purchased anyways).",3
2821,net.daylio,"i bought daylio years ago and have been using it to track my health symptoms rather than my mood alone. my only complaint is I'm very sad to see that Daylio has gone to subscription plans. i bought it for a one time payment on my iPad. i wanted to move it to my phone because that's easier to journal on and now i own a nice phone i can do that with-- nope! they demand a fee to use the full service of the app. and if you don't upgrade, expect to keep getting hit with random ads for upgrading.",3
2822,net.daylio,"The note section is uneccessary. The placement and display of where I wrote my thoughts down is one of two reasons why I don't really use the app as much as I would like to. A built-in journal with optional voice recording would be really useful, and I wouldn't have to keep downloading apps in hopes I can find a combination of Daylio and a journal together. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone because Daylio is just bland, and isn't puttimg in actual effort in order to make the app mainstream.",3
2823,net.daylio,"I really love this app. The interface is intuitive and aesthetically pleasing. It's easy to use and to customize. The problem is that about 2 months ago it stopped sending me notifications, despite reminders being turned on in the app and in settings. The app is, unfortunately, useless formmy purposes without it sending me reminders.",3
2824,net.daylio,"I've been using this app for the past few months to help keep track of my moods related to my bipolar disorder. I would have absolutely given the app five stars if not for the new subscription model. To change from a one time charge of less than 10 dollars to over 20 dollars PER YEAR is honestly kind of ridiculous, esp for a student. If I had a ""last day of one time payment premium"" notification the day before the change happened I would've just bought it outright, but that didn't happen.",3
2825,net.daylio,"App works well, no bugs that I've encountered. Recently the calendar interface changed and I find it ugly and difficult to use visually. Also, I am not a fan of subscription model for such a minor part of my life, but at least I can continue to use it for free while frequently ignoring requests to subscribe.",3
2826,net.daylio,love this app makes it so much easier to track the day. can see patterns in moods better. would like to be able to have it work on more than one device. updated after paying the one time fee for the premium and this was a few months ago. i got a pop up saying that my premium expired. if you change to a subscription you should grandfather the ones who paid before you changed it.,3
2827,net.daylio,"This is the only app I've used consistently to log feelings and activities(169 day streak. 430 entries total)which means I really do like using it.The bad is that you can't merge two backups.about halfway through using this app I switched phones thinking the back up meant I could eventually add all the others. Turns out you can only choose one. The developer even says ""it would take a while but your only option is to manually enter the ones you cant restore"" it would have saved me over an hour.",3
2828,net.daylio,"ETA I've had issues for months now getting the reminder to work. It never goes off and now I'm SO far behind its overwhelming. I've deleted and reinstalled, nothing seems to work. Pretty cool little app. I was keeping track of this stuff in a journal which required carrying it around everywere. Much better alternative. User friendly and I LOVE that there's a dark mode!",3
2829,net.daylio,"I love this app. I've been using it off an on for a couple of years, but am finally getting down to seriously journalling. The reason I am rating 3 stars instead of 5 is because my mom, who needs all of the things Daylio has to offer, downloaded the app and immediately got hit with ads or subscription notice. She was ready to drop the $25 on it, but not as a continuous thing. It should be a flat fee, not another bill for people, who are trying to use the app to destress, to worry about.",3
2830,net.daylio,"It's a good app. Great diary. Lets you see what you have done and how you were feeling on certain days, but I am giving it 3 stars because if you are on a different app, it sends you a notification that covers the whole screen. One time I was on Zoom and in the middle of my meeting, I get interupted by Daylio. When you get the notification, you can't exit. You have to fill the tracker/questions. So I won't recomend this app if you do very important things online.",3
2831,net.daylio,"I like the app so I can keep track of what I do from time to time and brings up my mental stability but, I dislike the way the app has changed. The app used to be such a nice thing to use but now its not that great of an experience anymore. Its sad you have to by premium just to use other colors and different ""emojis"". But overall its a great app to keep your mentally in check.",3
2832,net.daylio,"Best mood tracking app with a clunky interface as a result of too few customization abilities. Ultimately it fails as a usable journal, though its tracking seems unsurpassed. Why: 1) Daily entries should be collapsible. With multiple entries it's too much to view at once. 2) size of graphics/entries should be adjustable, 3) similarly the note feature forces me to use huge bold text in a single ugly font. Boo. I'm paying for this, let me make it more functional for my specific needs.",3
2833,net.daylio,"Been using for about 7 months. Very cool idea, but I don't feel there's enough range to identify larger patterns with only 5 levels of mood... there's many more than 3 levels between suicidal and life fulfillment for me that I'd like to track-- I myself am more aware of the ups and downs than the app can demonstrate with its limits. Unfortunately all these apps only offer 5 levels...",3
2834,net.daylio,"can you add a dark mode to this app? the colors are great but strain my eyes against the white background. the new color theme options are great but a color picker that enables more variation will be much nicer for accommodating individual needs or adjustments. another possibility is an object transparency option to reduce the color intensity of the mood/activity icons. lastly, as many others have suggested, a feature to track images would be great.",3
2835,net.daylio,"I've used Daylio over 5 years and have included almost 2,000 entries. I like the app but I find that as a long-time user there are features that I need now more than ever to keep the app quick + friendly. While the many improvements over the years are cool; they are not entirely crafted to make users with lots of Activities and Moods use the app quickly. I submitted an email with recs to make the experience faster for long time, high-use user like me. I also reached out on Insta-- no response.",3
2836,net.daylio,"I loved this app and had a 1000+ day streak until the new update. The goals page is useful... In theory. In reality, it distracts me and actually prevents me from logging because checking off a goal does not actually make a log! I can't get it to change from being the default page. I just want to have it back the way it was. I'm sorry but I'm going to look for other apps.",3
2837,net.daylio,"i literally just got this app but so far it's kinda hard to navigate. my biggest issue is that you can only set one goal unless you buy pReMiUm. i tried to set a second goal and it wouldn't let me, which just immediately discouraged me from trying to reach the goal. great, thanks, that's a lot of help.",3
2838,net.daylio,"Easy to use icon-based journaling. Easy to create and label new icons. Downsides: its backups are stored on Google Drive without any encryption, and in places that aren't directly readable by the accountholder. No way to determine what's actually being stored, if it stores more than it should. Local export of moods and icon values to CSV is available, but no import from it.",3
2839,net.daylio,It can be better. The app let's you edit your moods you have to buy the full version to get more emojis. Maybe I missed something but my frustration has been that nowhere in the app is explained how to access the emotions/emojis you add. When you are at the add screen you see the same 5 emojis even if you added 3 more but the same 5 are still there. Where did my new emotion/emojis go? I don't know. I look under the FAQs but that issue is not addressed. I kind of regret buying the app because there are no clear instructions on how to use it!!! I eventually figured out that I had to press and hold an emoji and THEN the emoji I added with the matching color of the one I'm pressing shows up. I just think I didn't have to go through this to add my emoji/emotion.,3
2840,net.daylio,"Good, but not perfect. I'm not sure why a mood tracker of all things doesn't have a sleep tracker. I've just been typing it in to the comments box, but having it actually be tracked would be nice. Not sure I like 'gamifying' my condition with cheesy achievements. Overall its decent, but missing features makes you download the other major trackers just to get the full functionality of what you expect out of this one.",3
2841,net.daylio,Edit: trying to cancel my premium subscription but it isn't straightforward and I am still trying to figure it out. The premium app was awesome but I am just not using it anymore. Original review: This app makes tracking moods and journaling simple and easy. The app is simple and I like that I can add moods.,3
2842,net.daylio,"Bought it as it seemed like what I wanted. the aesthetics are nice, but being able to see a line graph for each day to identify mood levels based on time of day would be awesome. Not sure why this app doesn't have that feature. Also, a nice dark mode wouldn't hurt.",3
2843,net.daylio,"I really love everything about this app (the color schemes, emojis, reminders) but feel it is missing one crucial element: text based journal entries. please add a feature where users can write a short text entry, in addition to logging moods and activities. Then it will be perfect!",3
2844,net.daylio,"Wish it had auto sync. I use in two devices and if I don't backup and then restore on other device right away, It will not retain any info. If I use device A. first, don't save right away, then use device B. the next day and hit backup, when I go to A to update, the entry in A will no longer be there. Wish I could do more than once emotion for entry. I can be sad and mad at same time or happy and bothered for example",3
2845,net.daylio,"I'm finding it to be ok but there are some things that irk me, like putting a lot of work into customisation for ease of use, is a time consuming & draining task. using it as A ""single journal entry"" app works, but an ""overal daily score"" using multiple entries woul improve insights. like a slider for mood, (chose an emoji or expression that fits), fill out what happened, and have the day summarised as an average. A good day may have bad spots & vice vera",3
2846,net.daylio,"Can you please increase the Moods Chart view window? Currently it's at 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months. A 6 months and a year would be helpful. Even better, a custom option that the user can choose to display the desired time window. Also, can you break out activities more clearly by groups? For example, I have the same activity ""Talked on the phone"" but on more than one group like ""mother"", ""wife"", etc. It would be helpful to know which group the activity is in when looking at charts or stats.",3
2847,net.daylio,"Good, but getting feature bloat. Wish there was some way to turn them off, especially the daily ""inspirational"" quotes those are the worst. Update: docked another star for showing an ad on premium. Not cool I literally paid for ad-free.",3
2848,net.daylio,"I like the app, just wish we could add videos and not have a limit on the images and videos we upload, also when recording a voicenote, it would be nice if we could pause and continue and rewind to hear, kind of like on whatsapp.",3
2849,net.daylio,"App keeps stopping even after updating. And even if it opens, I wouldn't see any of my entries.",3
2850,net.daylio,"There are some great features in the premium and the graphics are decent. Unfortunately using the app I still need to use another app for list of to dos in the goal. This means a goal cannot be made up of several parts. The app makes everything singular. Which means a morning routine of wash, brush teeth and walk - are all separate goals. (Suggest an option to remove all the fan faire, not wanted on the journey. This is a common assumption we all need a chearing team.) Edit: thx for response.",3
2851,net.daylio,a lot of ads to upgrade but the interface and the notifications are a plus!!,3
2852,net.daylio,"Definitely one of the best tracker/journal apps for sure. I love that I can customize how detailed everything is, even with the limitations of a free account. My problem however, is with the new subscription model for the premium version of the app. I don't find it reasonable at all, considering the rate at which we receive updates currently is not enough to justify the price for me. I was highly considering going premium, but I don't think I will unless it's changed back to a one time purchase.",3
2853,net.daylio,"The apps seems fine, although I really find the pro price ridiculous for what it offers. If it was a one time purchase I wouldn't mind paying,n but this is just too much for what it offers. It's quite a shame. I'll use it for a while, but if the adds becomes bothersome I'll just move to another app. Maybe you should consider adding a one buy lifetime purchase.",3
2854,net.daylio,"The app has worked well for quickly creating an overview for the activities, experiences and events of the day. Only issue is: The widget for goals is useful, but the ability to check off goals from the home screen requires the widget to take nearly all screen space. If you could make the widget smaller, for example only showing the icons next to the checkmark in small widget sizes, I would be grateful. Also please remove or the thick sidebar with the daylio icon. It's a huge waste of space.",3
2855,net.daylio,"I only use this app to track sudden changes in my mood as I am recovering from depression and phobias so I can look back at what I was doing that day. Only two issues I have is that I am not keen on my personal 'life' saved on some cloud somewhere, I would prefer local device backup. Secondly it's the fact is it has generic limited mood signs so the actual useability of the app itself limits moods it can track. Free version.",3
2856,net.daylio,"A basic way to record moods but has a significant flaw. Often during a mixed state mood will be low while symptoms of hypomania are present. This app would fail to pick that up because it only asks you to rate your mood from 'rad' to 'good' to 'meh' to 'bad' to 'terrible' and record your activities (reading, cooking etc). Definitely needs improvement. I do like the graph feature though.",3
2857,net.daylio,"I was 100% satisfied on iOS, until.. .. I changed smartphones to an Android (still keeping an iPad) realising I'd need a uselesss additional purchase here, as databases don't sync between platforms. So, if I start my day on one device, I won't be able to continue/finish it on another without a lot of manual import/export. Hopeless. This was a great app for me, starting years ago. Unfortunately, it does it completely wrong at data keeping. I went back to HABITIFY. I couldn't be happier.",3
2858,net.daylio,"This is a really good app, but there is one problem: I purchased Premium on my new phone, but it broke later. I restored my data on my old phone and started to record entries there, but ""Get Premium"" Ads keep popping up, but when I click on them they show the message you get when you get premium (Thank You, Your our knight in shining armor, etc). I paid for premium for no ads! Please fix this soon :/ (Otherwise, it's a really good app)",3
2859,net.daylio,"Nothing particularly special but it has a nice interface and let's you add custom tags. Does a good job of reminding you to add an entry without being too obtrusive. I've used this every day since downloading. Would really like the option to add a couple of photos for an entry, maybe a voice note too. Haven't upgraded to the paid version, maybe if I used it for an extended period of time. although I'm not sure how much a paid version could really add to the experience. Solid app overall.",3
2860,net.daylio,"I like the app, but the password protection doesn't really work the way it should, or at least the way I imagined it to work. The only time it comes up for me is after I save an entry if I closed my phone before saving. But its free to read until you actually save it. So if anyone opened my phone, they could still read it. And when the notification comes up, if someone's on my phone and clicks on it, everything opens up still. So the privacy protection doesn't function very well.",3
2861,net.daylio,"4 things would take this up to 5-star: 1. the ability to be able to scroll from one entry to the next by swiping. Look at ""Private Diary"" in the Google Play store. They don't maintain it now, but it does a great job of allowing you to move from entry to entry by scrolling. moving down the page is cumbersome, and slow, and it is easy to scroll past something. An option to read entries side to side would make a differecne. 2. It is ridiculous that there is not online portal for this - especially since you already have a website online. i.e. most other apps like this e.g. Private Diary, Evernote etc. give you the option to add an entry online, and sync across all devices. The ability to have one place where you can add entries is important, especially given how much your annual subscription is. 3. Biggest gripe. the text next to the icons gets truncated. You give a small amount of space to write that next to them. When you go back to the main page after you set icon and text for ""Activity"". 4. Accessibility. My eyesight is not the greatest and your icons are tiny. Ability to change font/icon size is pretty basic and opens yo your app to a wider audience. I would say how simple and brilliant it is. Once you have demonstrated you have genuinely listened and taken on board the above, this review goes up to 5-star :)",3
2862,net.daylio,"Generally a good app. I've been using this since 2017 and it's kept all of my entries. However, lately I've noticed that my past entries have been shortened so that I can't read the entire entry without editing the entry and scrolling down. A ... appears at the end of where the entry is cut off and I can't open the longer version any other way - this isn't ideal and it would be great if that could be changed. Other than that, decent app.",3
2863,net.daylio,"I like the app but it's missing some key features. I love the category, activity and mood systems, but I need more out of the notes. Need to be able to upload images, sometimes this is key for me. I do free writing exercises (hand-written) and would like to add those as entries in their original form. Not gonna type it out. Might switch to a different app for that feature. Would prefer to stick with this one but only if I can add images.",3
2864,net.daylio,"I think the idea is very good. many times I've wanted a program that would help me to log my feelings my emotions. thought I could see patterns, learn something about myself. Dailyo could have been that, but it just isn't. after more than two months of daily usage here is what I have to say: it's daoly pop-up is extremely intrusive. should have been an interactive notification instead. clicking the popup opens the app - very annoying! the bank of emotions is sparse. and the charts are mediocre.",3
2865,net.daylio,"I quite like the app, it fits my specific use case well enough. The one thing I would like to see added is multiples of the same activity per entry. I'd even consider purchasing the premium version, as it seems to offer some cool (but unnecessary) features beyond just removing the ads, were it not on a subscription basis. Seriously, who pays a subscription for an app that offers no content updates (because it can't, since it's a just mood tracker app)?",3
2866,net.daylio,"PROS: I like the customization of the mood emojis, and the app works well. No annoying mandatory location tracking is a big boon tor an app like this. CONS: I'd glady pay for it if it was a one-time flat fee, perhaps even if it was $0.99/month for just the mood portion, but the price is too high for what I use. I just want to track my moods. So far the ads haven't been intrusive but they are oriented in a way that makes it hard to tell it's an ad embedded. The ad icon should be bigger.",3
2867,net.daylio,"It's been ok. I still find it hard to do what I want. I wish customizing feelings and what your doing would be less confusing. I wish they would add in woman's menstrual cycle, it has alot to do with moods. It doesn't recommend exercises like other apps if your feeling stressed. This app is just really for journaling, nothing else, it's very simple but, way better then the Sensa App and a quarter of the cost. $20 for a year. I can definitely afford that.",3
2868,net.daylio,"It does what it says it will do. So far I don't have any activities, I wish there was an option to get it to stop asking everytime I enter my mood. I plan to use the activities eventually, but the option would be nice. Another suggestion is either a wear os app, or at least the ability to select your mood from the notification so it can be done on my smart watch. The toast feature isn't compatible with wear os. This is the perfect kind of app for a smart watch!",3
2869,net.daylio,"This is a great app for keeping track of feelings and activities, it's fun and you can customise colours and icons. But since they updated it, I can't use it as it's all too small to read and see. I'm vision impaired and it doesn't take accessibility settings into account and font sizes can't be changed in-app. As a premium user, I'm really disappointed.",3
2870,net.daylio,"This app is great. Love the concept and ease of use. However, I am a bit disappointed at the reminder feature. I have 3 reminders set throughout the day, and I usually only get reminded once. I paid for the full version of the app so I would expect full functionality. Would give a better review if not for that.",3
2871,net.daylio,"Great app to track many things and see some pretty interesting graphs and overviews. Customise moods and set goals and even get fun and motivating achievements for it. I think it has a lot of potential. The only thing that I don't understand is that it always just removes all checked activities if you accidentally leave the app , but it saves written text (for chosen mood .) would be great if it could cache the last activity choices too.",3
2872,net.daylio,"I haven't been using it for long, I think its real value will become clear the longer one uses it. I'd like to be able to edit the mood options; I'd describe most of my days somewhere between 'meh' and 'good' such as 'stable', 'ok', 'not bad' etc, so using this simple app loses some of the nuances but might allow patterns to become clear.",3
2873,net.daylio,"I really liked the concept of this app and I was even about to stick with it for a few weeks however there are too many ads present! So many trying to get you upgrade all the time that I find myself not wanting to go back into the app each time. As much as I liked this, it might just be worth investing some of my time in making a bullet journal that tracks these for me.",3
2874,net.daylio,"Love this! Use it every day. Some small room for improvement. Would be awesome to get more icons (especially abstract / nature based) and optional predefined times of day which can be used instead of an exact time input (i.e. just ""morning"", ""afternoon"", ""night"", ...) as some ppl are not logging right away. Edit: Actually stopped using this because the number of 'mood levels' is too coarsely grained (just 5 levels & new moods adhere to these too) making the stats kinda useless.",3
2875,net.daylio,I thought there were automatic backups so I assumed I had backed up my entries and I guess I hadn't. Automatic backup is a premium privilege. I lost some extremely important information and am absolutely devastated. I've stopped using the app now but it was pretty helpful. I wouldn't recommend it unless you have amazing memory or can afford premium.,3
2876,net.daylio,I purchased the pro version but there is one thing that I hate. When selecting the mood category .. we get scroll up version of different mood.. I have dozens of moods set up and I had to scroll up quite a bit which is annoying. What if the moods collapse and spread out in circular or other than having to scroll up. it would be more convenient.,3
2877,net.daylio,Love the app and use it as my diary now. Only improvement I'd like to suggest: Don't let the app stop reminding after a few ignored reminders. Sometimes I don't notice the reminders have stopped and then have gaps in my entries. Always bums me out. Thanks for your reply. The reminders work for me - but they don't come up anymore after I missed a day. Is that intended behaviour? I'm aware that I can add entries retrospectively but that doesn't solve the issue.,3
2878,net.daylio,"I liked the app as it was, and was debating on upgrading to premium. But I noticed I wasn't getting notifications and noticed that they had changed the premium model to be subscription based, and one of the things in the premium is unlimited notifications. I think it's scummy of them to removed a feature that was free and add it to the premium version.",3
2879,net.daylio,"All in all a fairly good app. My only complaint (though it is a big one) is that I bought the membership when it was on sale and the text said something along the lines of ""pay once, use forever"", but after about a year it keeps telling me my membership expired. I've had to reach out to have it renewed before, but now it happened again and I think I am just going to uninstall.",3
2880,net.daylio,"Otherwise great, but it really bothers me that the unfinished entry compeltely disappears if you accidentally or otherwise exit the app, even just for a second! This is very frustrating, especially after writing a long text in the notes section... Please fix this, so that if one exits the app before saving the entry, the entry stays there waiting to be finished",3
2881,net.daylio,"Like the app, the flexible way of monitoring habits, and I even like the daily reminder in the evening. Unfortunately when I want that daily reminder, there is no way of turning off your 'special offer' notifications and other irrelevant notifications I get in the morning. That notification is not gonna make me purchase anything - it's gonna make me delete the app.",3
2882,net.daylio,"Great app, extremely useful for my needs and has been very helpful in getting myself organised. However, 2 issues have recently been bugging me. Firstly, the text for activities cuts off and the entry page looks messy and disorganised. Secondly, if I forget to add an entry for a day the reminders stop and this way I could easily miss several days in a row, which defeats the purpose of having reminders at all. Please fix these issues because when the app works fine, it is wonderful. Thanks.",3
2883,net.daylio,"App is great and bought the premium version. But to lock the diary, there should be an option for us to deactivate/activate ""fingerprint"".

2884,net.daylio,"I love this app. It's nice to have this and interesting to see the mood changes, but I wish some of the things weren't specifically for premium (ie. Some achievements and having more than one goal). I understand you have to make money some how, but my first time using this I wanted to have more than one goal to better my mental health and I couldn't because I would've had to get premium. Which I didn't want to purchase",3
2885,net.daylio,"This app is nice but might be somewhat annoying. By default it shows gigantic notifications over half of my screen every day, and there is no obvious way to turn them off, not even in System Settings (could be turned off in app Settings -> Notification time ->  Display reminder pop-up, as suggested by the app developers).",3
2886,net.daylio,"Its a very useful app, especially for journaling. Something that really bothers me is that you can't transfer backups from Android to iOS and vice versa. A feature where you can see entries from this day a year ago, two years ago etc. would also be greatly appreciated.",3

It says that there were an a unexpected error. And it's really so annoying that I have to take the photo in the camera app itself and not in 'take photo' really annoying.",3
2888,net.daylio,"I enjoy this app, it's super easy to use and I love the customization. I wish it would give you more detailed/useful analytics though, specifically letting you see how certain activities are affecting your mood days after you do them, like drinking or not eating well. I also wish it let you create distinct mood tracks (e.g. mood at work or during the day vs mood at night/personal life).",3
2889,net.daylio,"im really enjoying it so far, 12 days in. i like how it reminds me. ease of use & customizability. i would like to make a suggestion that we be able to track our menstrual cycles with it as mood + hormone cycles are intertwined so strongly. it seems a shame that i would have to use a separate app, then crowbar the data together in order to get a huge piece of mood context. The lack of that ability costs a couple stars for me. it seems a bit female-blind.",3

If I have 2 photos I want to add for the day, I'll have to open and scroll my files to find 1 photo and I'll have to do it twice.)",3
2894,net.daylio,"Just paid for a subscription for this app thinking that it would have a proper journalling feature, you know since it's called Daylio Journal and all. Only to discover there's no journalling feature, other than a field called ""notes"" that's just one line tall. Seriously what I am supposed to type in one line that might be helpful? The rest of the features are pretty good but I'm annoyed that I feel like I need to find another separate journalling app or go back to Evernote just for this.",3
2895,net.daylio,"so far it's a 3 because I really want the in depth graph view right now haha. I have bipolar and really need to see my moods more on like an hourly basis. I am however enjoying the app it's fun to use and the free version so far is great, it serves its purpose for basic mood tracking. I also like that I can create my own activities, I've had to edit a few of them already lol. once I get the payed version I'll update and re-star :)",3
2896,net.daylio,"Hi, thank you for making this wonderful app. It really helps with writing daily journals and just tracking what happened that day. There's just one thing that bothers me- when I edit activities, I don't want to see the activities I archived. Could you update the app so archived can only be accessed in the archive section??? Thank you so much.",3
2897,net.daylio,"If there is a windows app, I'd gladly pay for the premium version. Some of us just like to write lengthier entries which is uncomfortable to do on a phone.  Also when searching entries, It would be great if the app could highlight which part of the entries contain that word.",3
2898,net.daylio,"Hard to read because there's not enough contrast between the text and background. I wish everything was bigger and with better visual contrast. I didn't appreciate my eyesight enough when I was young. I wish the app had an ""old person's"" version. I would give 5 stars for that. I would even pay extra for it.",3
2899,net.daylio,"The latest update has shrunk the width of the diary entry shown on screen, which makes your entries seem crushed and reduces the amount you can read without scrolling. Disappointing waste of space. Shame, as usually the updates are really good. Seems like this wasn't really thought through or tested.",3
2900,net.daylio,i like the app mostly. i like all the functions and would probably love the paid version. however i refuse to pay for moat apps so i guess i'll be uninstalling this app now. i understand they need to make money but i would prefer to watch videos to unlock premium content or even watch videos for game currency which could then be used to unlock premium content.,3
2901,net.daylio,"So far, this app is good. The only problem is that, i want to unlock more emoji's and emotions to use but it keep on saying i had to avail first the premium package. Is there a way i can unlock more emotions and emoji's without availing for the premium package? I mean, on some apps, there are always free item given to the users, all you have to do is to watch some certain videos then you can unlock more.",3
2902,net.daylio,"The app is great. My only gripe: whenever a reminder notifications appears, it triggers a ""back command"" that pulls you out of whatever you're doing (ie hides the keyboard if you're typing and/or backs out of whatever app you're in). Super frustrating.",3
2903,net.daylio,"hi dev team, gr8 way of data recording but please use this data to show mood related to activity so that users can see what makes them happy and unhappy whendoing x y or z. goals linked to tracking would also be great. so when a user clicks on a goal it appears in their icons and this too can be tracked.. ie done or not. keep up the good work",3
2904,net.daylio,"Its a quite nice mood/habit tracker journal, not exactly best for goal tracking (only 1goal tracking for free uset, and not customizeable). To fully enjoy the experience, better use premium which is around $33 annually, which allows advance statistics and unlimited goal. Free version is quite well enough, and comes with ads. It allows export to csv (but i dont really like the result template, coz not categorized well). I like bearable better.",3
2905,net.daylio,"Not all days can fit on a 1 to 5 grid. Being able to log complex emotions and reasons would help keep people honest and actually using the app. I used the app daily since January 1st, but realized most days were meh, when that really wasn't accurate, so using it was entirely pointless. I don't hate it, it could be good for some people. There is a lot of room for improvement.",3
2906,net.daylio,"It's a nice app, but the push to upgrade is getting too much, I had a pop-up about the mother's Day sale(not sure why that's a thing to begin with) after completing my activities for the day, and because I didn't interact with the sale notification my day wasn't recorded... If the push for premium membership gets any worse I'll have to look at alternatives.",3
2907,net.daylio,"Hi this app is amazing! There are so many optains to manage your life just inside the app. You can set goals, alarms and more but my only problems are the amount of things that are premium, you cant get the most of the app without paying and thats the trouble in heaps of apps that I dont really like. If you could broaden the options that would be really great but apart from that u app is great! Would recommend!",3
2908,net.daylio,"Just got the app. Noticed in the streak area of results that the number of days with mood is green while without is red, is it possible to allow us to edit that if it's a mood that's negative(like feeling stressed, etc.), so that the days without it are green? It feels weird to see a negative feeling recorded with a color that's supposed to be seen as positive when you're trying to get rid of that negative mood",3
2909,net.daylio,"Cons: Fancy -> messy, inputs are not well-defined -> bad data -> narrow and even wrong conclusions, activities are too general -> there are no attributes within activites, data isn't compatible with anything but the app itself and vice versa.... ++++ Pros: Best of similar apps, customisable, supportive, local files. This is a fairly new thing and I understand it takes iterations to improve the app, but I believe all these similar apps make fundamental mistakes which is why they don't succeed.",3
2910,net.daylio,Great app. Makes tracking my days simple and easy. UPDATE : Not sure why streaks cant span weeks. Bad design choice. Suddenly need to reenter entries that I've missed multiple times to get them stuck. Would be nice if it had integration with health and other tracking apps.,3
2911,net.daylio,"Great app, just wish creating a note was easier to get to, instead of having to select in a mood first and then an activity. There's too much friction and that prevents me from wanting to start a note. It would also be great if the notes supported markdown.",3
2912,net.daylio,"A decent way of keeping track of your days, quick and easy. However, my experience is that the app reinforces whatever you're feeling about your life. Looking back on average/bad days invites you to ponder that life hasn't been as good as one would hope, which in itself is a little upsetting. I therefore find myself ranking average days as good, to avoid being brought into a funk, and it all gets a little wonky.",3
2913,net.daylio,I've been using this for a few weeks now and I would say I like the app a decent bit. I like making my own feelings and activities on it. And I enjoy earning the badges. There are just two things I wish would be added to the app though: pictures and throw backs from a year ago. If there are throw backs on here I haven't seen any indication yet.,3
2914,net.daylio,"Great concept overall, wish pictures could be added, need to be able to sync across devices otherwise it's useless, the automated backups don't restore across devices automatically, have to manually create a backup and restore on my tablet to be able to see all my previous entries.",3
2915,net.daylio,"Great app! Would rate it 5 stars if the journal aspect of it were more prominent. As it stands journal entries are treated as an afterthought, and feel more like a description or note field for your mood details. Some users may want to make more detailed journal entries, and would benefit from a better experience in that regard.",3
2916,net.daylio,"An update recently made it so that when you're writing in the journal it will randomly add paragraphs and made all your bolded text normal, it's very annoying. Other than that, it's a great app. Soon as this is fixed, I'll change to 5 stars.",3
2917,net.daylio,The app has a neat interface for diarising. I removed a star because of the persistent notifications trying to persuade me to upgrade to premium that I can't see how to turn off. (Ed: I realised that another issue I had written about here was due to a setting on my phone.),3
2918,net.daylio,I purchased the Premium version. But it doesn't show anything that says I did. And I don't see anything different on the app that shows I bought it. Yet the Purchase went through. When do I see the Premium version ? I Really liked the Reminder to Post on this app. When I first tried it out. I thought that was part of the Premium version as well.,3
2919,net.daylio,"Just started using this and it's pretty swell! 💖 Sad I can't make more goals or reminders since I'm broke and really need to set up my goals...oh well I guess I'll use Google docs or sum. I might change the rating if my experience gets any better but just a suggestion could you add just a little more goals for free users only like 3-4, of course I can't just ask for something and it'll happen, so that's just my opinion 🥰🥰☺️",3
2920,net.daylio,I've now been using this app for 567 days and I love it! But! I've just got a new phone and despite all my efforts I can't transfer my previous entries. I paid for premium purely so I could move my data to my new device and I really don't want to lose over a year and a half worth of info,3
2921,net.daylio,"My therapist recommended this to me like a year back, and I liked it a lot. But I don't remember there being a premium or ads. It's like, good but, why the ads. I get having one or two off to the side, but god don't make them pop up in my face when I'm trying to type. Please stop trying to squeeze money out of a depressed broke person.",3
2922,net.daylio,"My Opinion. Update: The app developer has reached out and offered a solution to my concerns of self promoting ads (cross-promotion) after paying for a no ad experience. I do not agree with it still, and choose not to use their services anymore as I will not support self promotion over self care. They were professional in handling this and I will leave an average rating for that. Thank you.",3
2923,net.daylio,Overall it allows me to keep track of things like pain and activity levels but unfortunately it no longer reminds me at the times I have set. I have the notifications on but it forgets to notify me.,3
2924,net.daylio,"worked fine, until a month in it stopped giving me notifications to put in entries, which is the point of a mood tracker app. 3 months later notifications started up again. if I'm going to use an app for my mental health it needs to be consistent.",3
2925,net.daylio,"I like all the easy one click options for things. However, i was also looking for a journal i could write in. Combining the two would be amazing! Easy click on things when im busy and a place to write when i can... now that is worth a subscription.",3
2926,net.daylio,"This app has an achievement for registering every mood in one day. It's an irreplicable experience to tick a box confirming that you are in high distress, then be presented with a ""congratulations, achievement unlocked"" screen.",3
2927,net.daylio,"Does what it says it does, but even with no reminders setting will show pop-ups prodding to buy premium version from time to time (which it didn't a year ago). Pretty meh, but then again, so is most of the software.",3
2928,net.daylio,"I really liked the app at first. Then I found out that I cannot mark what I've done as I go (which is the easiest way to make sure I enter everything). I put things in and, if I don't finish it soon enough the app wipes it off of my phone because it wants me to start the next day and I've lost everything I had entered the previous day. I had been interested in purchasing the app but now I think ""whats the point if I'm going to keep loosing everything I enter."" I hope you fix this problem",3
2929,net.daylio,The app does not send reminders even though I have then on. If I miss an entry or swipe off the notification I won't receive anymore notifications until I go into the app and turn them back on and off again. This is super annoying. Whats the point if offering reminders if it won't work?,3
2930,net.daylio,"Awesome app! However it is not suited for long writing/journalling as the dev said I wish there is a journal feature to be integrated in this awesome app to me it even radder! And also the ability to attach photos, audio and video in the journal! And aldo a onetime payment, i really dont like subscription kind. I knew a lot of users will be happy if those feature are added in this app. Thank you",3

2932,net.daylio,"It's a really neat idea and the app is visually very appealing, but unless you're willing to pay money, you're only allowed to have one single goal. A three goal limit for free users I could understand, but the app seems almost useless if you're only allowed to pursue a single goal.",3
2933,net.daylio,"Would be good is you could turn OFF the Mood stuff. It's very annoying having to select a mood, and I also dislike both their look and their names. I want to track activity first, not a mood! Would also be nice if it could record a time-span, i.e. add end-time too.",3
2934,net.daylio,"Everything is great, I don't honestly have any issues using Daylio until the app keeps leaving itself. When I tried making a new 'entry' the app leaves itself and puts me to my home screen, with this bug I won't be able to keep track on my moods. Please fix this, this is a very great app and I can't just uninstall it. It's very useful to me.",3
2935,net.daylio,coulnt become friends afterall. btween causes and circumstances the mood seems to be coincidental. unless u actually working on the cause moods are unmanagable. unless u are mentally strong person or not suffering any disorders. then u probably do not need the mood tracker. a pen and a notebook are as good if not better for visual feedback.,3
2936,net.daylio,"So it was 2020 when I started using this app. I recorded many good memories in this app. I connected it to my email account, but now, 2022, I accidentally uninstalled this app. All my memories in 2020 to 2022 were erased. I tried back up and restore but I can't find entries. Ughh. I don't know how I can start my life again. I mean, there were so many good memories I putted here, then it suddenly vanished in an instant. 😔. Can I still recover those entries? Help me recover it. 😢",3
2937,net.daylio,The app does a good job of allowing you to jot your daily thoughts down and provides some ways to take a look at a glance at how you've been feeling over an extended period of time. The app would much a 5 star if there were a few features: Why can't I view my diary from a browser on my pc? Why can't I track more specific mental health needs like psychotic episodes? Why isn't there a way to instruct the app to remind me to do activities that have been previously recorded as feeling good?,3
2938,net.daylio,Love the customizability of the app but I really want to be able to share my data with someone close to me so they can monitor my moods. Also would be good to be able to track things like sleep and/or medication intake separately.,3
2939,net.daylio,"It is a good app for tracking your days and keeping a memory for everything :) The downsides are that it has ads everywhere, and those ads make the UI look bad. But I recommend to anyone who likes to journal in a quick way✓",3

2948,net.daylio,It is a nice concept but for you to have to pay to be organized I find that a bit stuipid and everything besides moods has to be premium and you can only have one goal so I dont recommend it unless you want to pay.,3
2949,net.daylio,"I like the app, but it's lacking too much for being 'free'. You can't set up more than one goal to improve your daily routine, cause otherwise you need to pay?! that makes it not as useful as it could be.",3

2951,net.daylio,Pretty good app for daily journaling. I like that you can make multiple entries in the same day with different moods. Would be better if you could add photos or images to entries.,3

After evaluating my emotions i should choose whats next- or just accepting them or to choose actions (needs) So you can do better guys, i believe you!!",3

2957,net.daylio,"I really love your app! To me it is fun to play around with data and your app is (almost) perfect for it. I say almost because the .csv export file does not sepparate each activity in its own column, which would make this app a 5 star app if it did.",3
2958,net.daylio,"Bought premium. However the app needs 2 things for 5 stars. 1: let me add different colours to each activity icon. 2: let me upload photos; this is a diary app! Backups are to gdrive anyway so it can't hurt. Otherwise, great job devs!",3

Please add this feature in further updates. every habit tracking app needs a streak count!,3
2995,net.daylio,Only about 30 days in but it's useful. I just wish the layout of the main 'day' emojis was better. I added one but its hidden behind one of the end emojis. Surely this could be laid out the same as the activities??,3

That is happening so frequently recently, and I hate it. I know I logged it, why's it not being saved?",3

Why: 1) Daily entries should be collapsible.

3099,net.daylio,I thought there were automatic backups so I assumed I had backed up my entries and I guess I hadn't. Automatic backup is a premium privilege. I lost some extremely important information and am absolutely devastated. I've stopped using the app now but it was pretty helpful. I wouldn't recommend it unless you have amazing memory or can afford premium.,3
3100,net.daylio,eeeh you probably won't find better,3
3101,net.daylio,"Good, but not perfect. I'm not sure why a mood tracker of all things doesn't have a sleep tracker. I've just been typing it in to the comments box, but having it actually be tracked would be nice. Not sure I like 'gamifying' my condition with cheesy achievements. Overall its decent, but missing features makes you download the other major trackers just to get the full functionality of what you expect out of this one.",3

3104,net.daylio,"It's been ok. I still find it hard to do what I want. I wish customizing feelings and what your doing would be less confusing. I wish they would add in woman's menstrual cycle, it has alot to do with moods. It doesn't recommend exercises like other apps if your feeling stressed. This app is just really for journaling, nothing else, it's very simple but, way better then the Sensa App and a quarter of the cost. $20 for a year. I can definitely afford that.",3
3105,net.daylio,"It's hard to add images but overall a useful app. Edit: It's difficult to add multiple images. I'm not sure if it's because of my device but I'll be brought to the android media files manager area instead of my photo gallery app AND I'm restricted to selecting 1 each time. (Eg. If I have 2 photos I want to add for the day, I'll have to open and scroll my files to find 1 photo and I'll have to do it twice.)",3
3106,net.daylio,App works very well. I wanted to do it everyday but got too boring to do it everyday. That is my fault but just a warning for all of those trying to keep their days organized.,3

Now when I installed it and want to sign in to my account it says ""Daylio doesn't work without Google play services which are not supported by your device"" What should I do???",3
3108,net.daylio,The constant sale ads are really annoying. The sale seems to be on most of the time so just set the normal price of the app as the sale price instead of spamming people with ads for it..,3

I am however enjoying the app it's fun to use and the free version so far is great, it serves its purpose for basic mood tracking. I also like that I can create my own activities, I've had to edit a few of them already lol. once I get the payed version I'll update and re-star :)",3
3110,net.daylio,It's a great app overall however alot of it is behind a paywall. If you want to add more daily tasks for good habbits buy premium. I can help but feel if this was for the benifits of mental health simple things like adding more goals wouldnt be behind said wall. I get you need to make money. But I wanted to start off slow. Drink water everyday. But now it's all I can do and I find myself looking for an app that won't make the same mistake.,3
3111,net.daylio,"Generally a good app. I've been using this since 2017 and it's kept all of my entries. However, lately I've noticed that my past entries have been shortened so that I can't read the entire entry without editing the entry and scrolling down. A ... appears at the end of where the entry is cut off and I can't open the longer version any other way - this isn't ideal and it would be great if that could be changed.

3114,net.daylio,The pros: - Very customizable. - Good UI - Helps find patterns - Free version is fully functional. The cons: - Asks for a subscription for an app that doesn't provide any service or maintenance. Why should I pay monthly for a standalone piece of software? - Very intrusive ads for its own subscription upsell. - Does not offer a one-time purchase to remove ads or subscription upsells.,3
3115,net.daylio,"The app has worked well for quickly creating an overview for the activities, experiences and events of the day. Only issue is: The widget for goals is useful, but the ability to check off goals from the home screen requires the widget to take nearly all screen space. If you could make the widget smaller, for example only showing the icons next to the checkmark in small widget sizes, I would be grateful. Also please remove or the thick sidebar with the daylio icon. It's a huge waste of space.",3

Only to discover there's no journalling feature, other than a field called ""notes"" that's just one line tall. Seriously what I am supposed to type in one line that might be helpful? The rest of the features are pretty good but I'm annoyed that I feel like I need to find another separate journalling app or go back to Evernote just for this.",3

Unfortunately all these apps only offer 5 levels...",3

If the push for premium membership gets any worse I'll have to look at alternatives.",3
3120,net.daylio,"Not worth the premium. It allows you to create unlimited moods and activities, but the reporting only shows you the same 5 basic moods.",3

3126,net.daylio,Nice for traking habits and mood,3
3127,net.daylio,Not bad,3
3128,net.daylio,"I loved this app and had a 1000+ day streak until the new update. The goals page is useful... In theory. In reality, it distracts me and actually prevents me from logging because checking off a goal does not actually make a log! I can't get it to change from being the default page. I just want to have it back the way it was. I'm sorry but I'm going to look for other apps.",3
3129,net.daylio,It's decent for free,3
3130,net.daylio,Didn't care for it.,3
3131,net.daylio,it's OK.,3
3132,net.daylio,Don't know how it works,3

3134,net.daylio,"So it was 2020 when I started using this app. I recorded many good memories in this app. I connected it to my email account, but now, 2022, I accidentally uninstalled this app. All my memories in 2020 to 2022 were erased. I tried back up and restore but I can't find entries. Ughh. I don't know how I can start my life again. I mean, there were so many good memories I putted here, then it suddenly vanished in an instant. 😔. Can I still recover those entries? Help me recover it. 😢",3

3142,net.daylio,To much need of premium,3

3144,net.daylio,Well. I lov e this app on my Apple phone and had been subscribed to the yearly annual fee for a few years now. Get a Google phone and the yearly fee is more then double. So disappointing.,3
3145,net.daylio,Make better designed widgets,3
3146,net.daylio,"Great app, just wish creating a note was easier to get to, instead of having to select in a mood first and then an activity. There's too much friction and that prevents me from wanting to start a note. It would also be great if the notes supported markdown.",3

3148,net.daylio,"I love this app, I have a streak of 1233 days. That's how much I use this app. So why three stars? The app has been flawless up until now, now it ignores my reminder times.

3149,net.daylio,"ETA I've had issues for months now getting the reminder to work. It never goes off and now I'm SO far behind its overwhelming. I've deleted and reinstalled, nothing seems to work. Pretty cool little app. I was keeping track of this stuff in a journal which required carrying it around everywere. Much better alternative. User friendly and I LOVE that there's a dark mode!",3
3150,net.daylio,"It does what it says it will do. So far I don't have any activities, I wish there was an option to get it to stop asking everytime I enter my mood. I plan to use the activities eventually, but the option would be nice. Another suggestion is either a wear os app, or at least the ability to select your mood from the notification so it can be done on my smart watch. The toast feature isn't compatible with wear os. This is the perfect kind of app for a smart watch!",3

3152,net.daylio,It good I keeps my mood in track,3
3153,net.daylio,"Not really sure of the point of this but it works. I wish there were more faces for emotions though, like confused, or concered, or bored or something",3

3155,net.daylio,might not wanna,3
3156,net.daylio,"I had to use this app back when I had daily chronic headaches. All it is is a mood tracking app. I wish it had activity on it that could possibly help your mood better.

3157,net.daylio,"Hi this app is amazing! There are so many optains to manage your life just inside the app. You can set goals, alarms and more but my only problems are the amount of things that are premium, you cant get the most of the app without paying and thats the trouble in heaps of apps that I dont really like. If you could broaden the options that would be really great but apart from that u app is great! Would recommend!",3
3158,net.daylio,At least you added Persian and Arabic,3
3159,net.daylio,"I had permanent premium on my iOS app. without those functionalities, I can't really use this in the way I became used to as a therapeutic tool. get rid of this trash subscription mess.",3
3160,net.daylio,IT'S OKAY,3
3161,net.daylio,"This is a great app for keeping track of feelings and activities, it's fun and you can customise colours and icons. But since they updated it, I can't use it as it's all too small to read and see. I'm vision impaired and it doesn't take accessibility settings into account and font sizes can't be changed in-app. As a premium user, I'm really disappointed.",3
3162,net.daylio,"Good mood tracking, lacking a little bit on the Journaling part.",3
3163,net.daylio,Please share the refund link or option.,3
3164,net.daylio,"Great app to track many things and see some pretty interesting graphs and overviews. Customise moods and set goals and even get fun and motivating achievements for it. I think it has a lot of potential. The only thing that I don't understand is that it always just removes all checked activities if you accidentally leave the app , but it saves written text (for chosen mood .) would be great if it could cache the last activity choices too.",3
3165,net.daylio,I wanna lino my therapist to the app I don't even see it as an option in Premium? Otherwise awsm interface etc ...,3

3168,net.daylio,"I love this app its amazing. But there are somethungs that i wish did not need a membership like if you want to set more goals then you need to buy a membership. And i just got this to help me not to somewhat help me, other that that its a great app.",3

3170,net.daylio,"I don't like the changes, I can't use my old emotions and setup.",3

3173,net.daylio,"it's fine, although being able to set when the reminder happens would be great. I don't know how I feel at 1am it's literally only been an hour Edit* you can do that my bad Edit 2* dropped down a star because the stupid reply that didn't read the edits. And considered a feature they already had as a suggestion",3
3174,net.daylio,"Overall good for keeping track of things. The only beef i have w this app is the notifs which I could probably just turn off and the fact that they make me feel guilty abt deleting something ""Do you still want to mercilessly delete this activity?""

3175,net.daylio,it's a good app. Though the moods are severely limited if you don't have premium.,3
3176,net.daylio,"one of the useful and great apps. but I hope there's no payment subscribe, or more features will be opened for free.",3
3177,net.daylio,I wanna buy premium but it is too costly.,3

3185,net.daylio,Trying to understand! I'm not used to track diary routines. Good tool to help I guess!,3
3186,net.daylio,I love this app however I wish there are more moodlet (face emojis) to choose from . There are more than enough for the activities so I think it should also have a large variety for the actual moods.,3
3187,net.daylio,"I have been a long time user. But the recent changes to goals hide monthly progress. I have no idea where I am each month in my goals, it only shows the total streak. This make it impossible to track progress.",3
3188,net.daylio,It alright ig,3
3189,net.daylio,"This app is excellent and i love it and grateful. But now i feel very disappointed because before this i can freely add mood that i want but after i updated, it suddenly become premium like what the helll i'm a student and don't have money and tht app supposed to be my therapy.. Please other thing i don't mind to be premium but not for add mood and add activities 〒_〒",3
3190,net.daylio,Would love to be able to change the main screen upon opening the app so i dont see last entry... maybe opening to the calendar would be better,3

3192,net.daylio,This app is very helpful but I wouldn't give it a five star rating. Creating different categories can be difficult at times,3
3193,net.daylio,"The app worked great for me. I had the free version and i learned something new about myself based on trends! Although it was tough to judge since most of the review features are behind a paywall. I liked that activities are front and center. Writing entries can be as simple or long as you like. Seeing the entries is great because i get to see things that maybe i never wanna try doing again, so they are motivations for change. Uninstalled because it drains battery hard, sadly.",3
3194,net.daylio,App has changed in many ways. Getting better than the start of the year is a positive.,3
3195,net.daylio,Love this app and it helped with my mental health. Sadly had a few glitches where it would just close out while I was trying to use the app.,3

3197,net.daylio,why you don't have language arabic ???,3
3198,net.daylio,Still needs Data security emphasis.,3
3199,net.daylio,Gay,3
3200,net.daylio,"This app is great! No ads, and I get to keep track of what I've done for the day. I use it as a way of seeing if I've completed all my tasks or my goals for the day. The only down fall imo is that you have to have premium to do alot of things on the app :/ I don't have premium and sometimes find it difficult,, I wanted to have 2 goals but since I don't have premium I can only have 1. Or I wanted to put a different emoji for an activity it's nothing big really,,",4
3201,net.daylio,I use to have this all years ago I believe around 2017-2018 on my old phone and I made so many entries and the app use to be free. I wonder how I can find my old entries before? It's on my same email I have now. I just started again and there's so many features that seem really fun and interactive. I'll decide if I want the paid version or not.,4
3202,net.daylio,"I'm having a new bug issue. Even though it is set to remind me at 9pm, it instead didn't remind me at all on the 12th (4 hours ago). It then reminded me at 0100 on the 13th (6 minutes ago) and when I tapped the notification and made my entry, it showed me as not having entered an entry for the 12th, which is what I thought the notification was reminding me to do.",4
3203,net.daylio,"I've been using this app for just over a year now, and it's worked pretty well. One minor feature I would like to see is proper support for is advanced HTML editing within entries. It's technically possible in the Quick Note box, but those tags can't be edited later. It would be nice if there were an ""advanced"" toggle in the full note view to enable editing the raw formatting tags.",4
3204,net.daylio,"great way to keep track of my mood, goals, and just have a better sense of time. it helps me to have a realistic view of how i have been doing to look back on and realize that not every day is horrible. there aren't ads everywhere, but they do try to get you to buy some kind of optional subscription which gets annoying. that's probably my only complaint!",4
3205,net.daylio,"⭐Fantastic app for tracking moods & all of the various things that affect your moods. I would absolutely give it a 5th star if it had a companion app on the Pixel Watch. I would much rather be able to quickly mark what my mood is in the moment, without having to drag my phone out of my pocket. (first world problems, right? 😁) I know Wear OS 4 the the Pixel Watch 2 can monitor your stress levels, but it's just not in-depth enough for my liking. Great app, totally worth paying for. 👍",4
3206,net.daylio,"This app is amazing. I love that you're able to write additional notes and that you're able to track your mood and other activities if you want to. The one thing I wished this app had was being able to mark / draw in the notes section while still being able to type in it. I just think it'd be handy for people like me who use a tablet and don't want to type all the time. Otherwise, I quite enjoy using this app. It has a very clean interface, and I haven't bumped into any issues while using it.",4
3207,net.daylio,"Listen, I hate that tracking multiple goals is locked behind a subscription. But focusing just on what the free version does, it does it very well. The daily mood tracking is a valuable tool with great customization, even for free users. If there was an option for a lifetime license in app for $20-70, I'd pay it in an instant. I just don't do subscriptions.",4
3208,net.daylio,"Overall, a useful app for keeping track of daily ups and downs (multiple times a day, if you like). I like being able to define my own tasks and moods. Slightly annoyed that basic color changes (themes) are behind the paywall, but that's not a huge deal. However, sometimes a full-screen ad pops up when I start the program, and I can't figure out how to close the ad and get to the program except to close the program and reopen it; design fail! Otherwise, definitely give this a shot.",4
3209,net.daylio,"This is for the free version - I have one or two minor issues with it, but overall it's good. Never had any problems with crashing, haven't noticed any bugs. The ads are there but are nearly seamless in the design so I barely notice them. I like that even on the free version there is a ton of customization you can do. I'm not too keen on the achievement! sticker thing they've got going. The gold star on 'your best average mood day' in particular annoys me. I think they were aiming for it to be like a game, which it may still for some, but for me it's a little too 'elementary school here's a shiny sticker!', and for some this might actually feel discouraging if you don't get those things. But again, most of the app seems helpful, and it's free, so can't hurt to try and see if it's a match for you.",4
3210,net.daylio,"Its alright, pretty functional. Has customizable moods, tags for each day, and notes for each day with formatting options such as bold, italic etc. Its nothing exceptional, so it isnt 5★, but it does what it says, and thats good enough for this app. Note I have a Play Pass subscription, so I dont know if the features I mentioned are exclusive to the premium version.",4
3211,net.daylio,"Great app for mood tracking! It's missing a few features I would find useful such as allowing for additional text entry boxes when recording categories, and metrics around correlated activities. It's also subscription based for many of the more useful features, which makes me hope that there is continued development and support of the product.",4
3212,net.daylio,"great app. i like all it's features and enjoy using it. one feature i wouldn't mind having is the option to add a one word descriptor along with the general mood that i can see across the calendar. my days might have been good but at a glance I'd like to see how often i felt scattered, lost, tired, or unmotivated. this would help see trends while working with meds and other personal changes. thanks for creating this and for the help it's given.",4
3213,net.daylio,"Great app for mood tracking and journaling, no bugs that I've experienced and a clean and crisp user experience. A few criticisms and ideas: 1) Let users define the top level moods. I feel like I could add a few in between to better monitor my moods. 2) Add functionality to add pictures to my entries. Overall I'm very happy with the app and world definitely recommend it. Ad free is worth the $.",4
3214,net.daylio,"I really enjoy the idea of this journal app. I've tried Bullet Journaling and fell in love, but having a busy lifestyle, I couldn't journal as much as I liked. This app has made it possible to keep up with the important bits of my Journal (habits, mood, and thoughts) I do wish that there was also a budget tracker and chore tracker, as well. The habit tracker would be better if you could just click done, maybe add a picture or a thought, but not a while journal entry. Other than that, love it!",4
3215,net.daylio,ive been using this app for years & it hasnt helped me stabilize my mood but i do like having a record of how my mood actually flexes and changes. the graphs are super helpful for therapy purposes as well. totally worth paid version for extra moods and things. the only thing that sucks is the log didnt change from phone to phone even though i put it in the cloud or whatever so i lost 2 years of data,4
3216,net.daylio,"4/5 ONLY because of the lack of photo integration. Other than that, I love this app enough that I didn't hesitate to pay the one-time cost for Premium, which isn't spendy in the first place. As far as I can tell, all features work smoothly on my little S5, it's not overinflated in file size or with updates, and the customization for goals, reminders, moods, and activities are a lot more freeform than I expected (and tracked accurately). Just let me add photos, pretty please?",4
3217,net.daylio,"The reason why I uninstalled this app is because I haven't used it or neither opened it in a really long time, and so therefore it's a little too much for me. I rather have stuck with a easily trackable mood diary, even though. I understand other people's suggestions on improvement, I don't need a note title. Nor do I need to attach photos even though its recommended. I rather just stuck with an entry log, and mood title. Even though it's a good app, it's a little to much.",4
3218,net.daylio,"app is pretty solid, I actually find the habit reminder unobtrusive unlike some other apps. It's intuitively designed and doesn't require much brain power to fill out, so at the end of a long day or stressful period when you're not firing on all cylinders it's still doable to be accountable. That last part is this app's greatest strength by far and makes it unique.",4
3219,net.daylio,This app is great! I bought premium and have been using it every day for nine days now. There are just two other features that I'd like to see that I don't think would be hard to implement. 1. Daily statistics. I'd like to see how my mood changes as the day progresses. This could be based on entries within certain hour ranges and averaged with every other day in the month. 2. Lifetime statistics. I'd like to see charts based on all entries instead of just for one month or one year.,4
3220,net.daylio,I enjoy the the app I definitely would recommend bc it's easy to use and simple to navigate. its ver straightforward. it's also very clean looking and there customazation options like emojis and color themes. theres only two things I dont like. i dont like the way habits are tracked I it was in a different section rather than needing an entry. I also wish there was a way in could select more than one emotion at a time bc sometimes you are feeling more than one thing.,4
3221,net.daylio,"I'm enjoying this app so far. It helps me focus and unwind by just getting things out in the""open"". I liked the free version so much that i upgraded to the paid version and it is worth it! The color schemes are nice, you can personalize moods to fit your situation along with the right emoji . I've been using it for almost a month now and have only missed one day because even with the reminder, i was just tired!",4
3222,net.daylio,"There is one change I'd love to see this app introduce... The ability to have reminders be set to different times on different days. I like to journal at the end of my day. However, I work overnights. So my day ends normally at 6am Tues-Sat so for those days I'd love to be able to set reminders for those times. However Saturday night and Sunday night I would end up journaling much earlier in the night as I don't work. As currently set up I have to set 2 reminders that go off everyday.",4
3223,net.daylio,"An app which does what it should very well. Pleasing to the eye, well thought out. It is likely the best diary app you will find. I have only one idea that would take this app beyond my highest expectations, and that is an emotion log that is separate from both the rating and activity logs. You do allow me to personalize the rating scale, but the emotions I choose are fixed to one number rating. My issue is, sometime I'm restless as a 2(bad), but sometimes I'm restless, but still a 4(good).",4
3224,net.daylio,"This app would be great and arguably one of the best journaling apps if it didn't have this one mistake. It's that your entries won't save if you go on another device, even if you backup it into your account. Adding all the entries again is time consuming and if you lose your phone, you pretty much lose all your entries permanently. Its the only thing they need to fix on this app.",4
3225,net.daylio,"Purchased version review. I started using this to check my mood vs activities to look for potential changes (like, does going to work depress me? Duh, yes). I gave it to my teen daughter and we use it to discuss how she is doing. Recs: 1. Be able to alphabetize lists. 2. Start a category for negatives, because seeing the not achieved list shrink would be as affirming as the done list and some might prefer one or both. 3. Enable setting colours via palette and saving the scheme.",4
3226,net.daylio,"I'm really enjoying this journal app. I've tried three different journal/diary apps recently and this one is unique. It tracks your moods and activities and over time will provide stats. You can set reminders not just to record your thoughts, but to do all sorts of activities. I had thought that simplicity was all I needed in a journal app. I'm happy to say that I was wrong. I'll be sticking with this one. No doubt that over time it'll improve somehow. It'll earn that 5th star in time. 👍",4
3227,net.daylio,"Overall wonderful app. Easy to use with some interesting features, but without so many ""features"" you get lost. 1 issue: everything is listed as an activity. Weather, location, emotions. These should be classified as conditions or circumstances instead. This might make tracking mood patterns a bit easier and make more sense.",4
3228,net.daylio,"I love everything about this app. It's very user friendly, and the best part is that there are stats. So you get to see exactly what needs to be changed about your life pattern. The ONLY reason I've given Daylio 4 stars rather than 5 is because I'd like the opportunity to attach pictures or short videos to my entries. Another plus would be if the app allowed you to document video journal entries for when you're on the go or simply have too many racing thoughts to slow them down enough to type.",4
3229,net.daylio,"An incredibly lovely app. My only frustration is that there is no desktop version- I noticed the developers have stated they want to focus on perfecting their mobile app before touching desktop. Completely understandable- so I use bluestacks so I can use the app on my computer. The only issue is that I can't seem to get the apps on my computer and phone to sync, so I have to choose one and stick with it. Otherwise, I really love this app and it is the best one of its type I have come across.",4
3230,net.daylio,"It's been a while since I used the app. I have a 6-month gap from my last backup. Also, the pricing changed to subscription-based. But I am glad that premium features are unlocked for Play Pass users. The overall experience is great and amazing! My only suggestion is to make the reminders more reliable because it just don't work anymore for some reason.",4
3231,net.daylio,"I'm liking it a lot. its easy nature makes it the most consistent ive been with these types of journals. However, I got the paid version in hopes that they'd allow more than five colors for moods(like say have 8 distinct moods with their own colors), but I can't seem to find a feature like that. That's the only real negative i have though. great app!",4
3232,net.daylio,"This is a great app. However the lack of a night mode or dark mode is killing me. I searched their FAQ and only found two options which are far from efficient. An option to invert your entire system in the Accessibility settings (but this is the ONLY app I need to invert), or download an app that changes your brightness as specific times (already using (auto brightness setting).  That is my only complaint. I like to view this app when I wake up and I feel like it is burning my eyes. For now I am only using the app in the afternoons but the ultra white theme is off putting and surly doing nothing to help with my battery life.   Any plans to add a dark mode? Please say yes.",4
3233,net.daylio,"this is a really great app. I've been using it for a week now and I'm very satisfied with the performance of all the little details. probably the best mood tracker on Google play from what I've seen. I'm eating it four stars though, only because you can only have one goal at a time unless you pay and you can only have a few moods. it's great that they have a premium thing, but it's $10 USD and you can't access half of everything the app offers without it. great app though i really suggest it. :)",4
3234,net.daylio,"This is a great app and helps me remember what I did each day! I love that I can add my own personal goals and activities. I only give it 4 stars because I cannot transfer purchases between Android and iOS. This is a terrible model because I had just renewed my subscription in October for 1 year (Android) and now I have to purchase a new subscription on my new phone (iOS). I know it's not much, but what a waste of $12! The one good thing was that it was very easy to export and import data.",4
3235,net.daylio,"It's Simple and easy to learn, I enjoy this app a lot, it's a beautifully simple and easy app to help me keep track of my moods but there are a few changes I'd like. First of all I think $10 is a lot for the VIP part of the app it gives a few parts of the app that are helpful and nice but in my opinion not it's not worth $10. Second, I want more, I want this to be a planner or helps you with little meditations and sleep habits. But it doesn't offer that.",4
3236,net.daylio,"Very good app, that does what it should, no premium needed! I've been using this app for two weeks now, and it's great. I'm willing to buy premium in the long run if I find a feature I really like! One idea is an anti goal, where if you log that activity you break the streak. I had to fake this by adding a goal called quit, and setting the reminder for the end of the day.",4
3237,net.daylio,"This is a great app, but I would give it 5 stars if it had some sort of reminder which wasn't just describing your day. Also, you can't change the message for individual notifications - it's all or nothing, which is a shame. I'm glad I got the pro version on sale, because it has some glaring issues for an app I've paid money for. For a pro, it has an amazingly sleek and simple design, which can't be beat. I hope they make some simple improvements so that it becomes an amazing app.",4
3238,net.daylio,"pretty useful and cute mood tracker app! Very many activity emojis to choose from and brings up nice correlations. it even has a mood widget and a goals widget! My only wish is I'd love to be able to check off goals (from the goals widget and in the app) without being jumped into the place you have to choose a mood, because the latter is much harder to think about, so it causes me to avoid the whole thing.",4
3239,net.daylio,"I love this app. Having a few mental illnesses it makes it much easier to watch my mood trends and habit patterns, I use this in conjunction with daily journaling in a notebook as well. I found it easy to use and very customizable even within the constraints of a non premium account. The insistence on paying can be much sometimes, especially if you're easily annoyed by micro transactions but the need is understandable and there's half off sales pretty regularly.",4
3240,net.daylio,"Good diary app, lets you say at a glance what you've done, how you're feeling, and describe more in the note. My one issue was you can't add any files such as pictures, audio, or video, which was what made me eventually move to a different app. Really easy to see patterns in your mood at a glance though, better than the app I switched to. But I really wanted to add pictures and audio to my entries, so that was the only reason I switched. Although another thing that's a little annoying in retrospect is that if you add really long notes to your entries, they don't get compacted down so it can be hard to find the entry you want when you have to scroll through huge chunks of text. However this app wasn't made for that so I can't really blame it.",4
3241,net.daylio,"This was an awesome app! It looks amazing, has minimal ads (I have premium but I think the free version doesn't have any either). Speaking of premium, its incredibly cheap. I got it when it was on sale and it was only 12 dollars for the whole year. Sales happen relatively frequently and it is very worth it. I only have two problems with the app: 1. You can only have three pictures under a single day 2. You cant put any information under your goals. It would be rly nice be able to toggle it.",4
3242,net.daylio,"Very easy to use. Having different colors for the ""Mood"" of a whole day is useful, however I think it'll be even more useful if the different ""Activities"" logged for a day can also be assigned different colors, so there can be a quick visual overview of how events relate to moods. In other words, allow users to have a quick visual of positive events and negative events.",4
3243,net.daylio,"overall Daylio is amazing. It's easy to use and convenient to publish activities. If you get the pro version then you can essentially make any mood you want, allowing you to make a full array of how you feel that specific day with emojis to assist your memory. My only complaint is I wish it made daily goals more of a check list. At least have some sort of daily check list, this way I can add things to it and itll remind me but its not necessarily an ""everyday"" goal.",4
3244,net.daylio,Easy to engage with. Wish added activities could be sorted into proper subjects for easier use of finding them. Also think it would be cool if you could attach a picture to journal entries. Only been using it a month and the reminders are helpful so I don't miss days. May update this later from a 4* to a 5* once I've worked with it more and tested out how useful it could be in the long term.,4
3245,net.daylio,"Pretty great app. I like being able to look back over the month with all the stats this app has. I really like looking at the year and being able to see how my mood has changed over time. One problem I have is with the goal notifications. When I have a goal I want to do a couple times a month or week, it's really annoying getting the notifications every single day. Even moreso when I've completed my goal count, but still get notifications on it.",4
3246,net.daylio,"I absolutely love this app! I am able to customize it entirely to meet my goals and tracking needs. And it is just practical, simple while still being able to help me document difficult trends, colorful, fun, cute, and so helpful. Love the layout. I have run into trouble with restoring past entries. Hopefully they are working that out! I have recommended this app to friends and family and if you get it you will love it!!!!!",4
3247,net.daylio,Overall I love the app! It's the best I've found for my specific scenario. Just wish there was more customizability to the rating system. You can only pick 5 levels that actually show up on graphs. If you are needing more nuance it struggles. For instance if you are bipolar. It's important to be able to have extra levels to differentiate between a good mood & a manic episode or a bad mood vs a depressive cycle. Being able to increase the number of mood levels as needed would be super helpful.,4
3248,net.daylio,"I absolutely LOVE this app, it's great for people who have trouble keep a journal as it's right on your phone. I keep a widget on my home screen making it even better, I really like the simplicity and customization on the app. My only reason for 4 stars is that if the screen to buy premium is accidentally clicked on or it pops up, there is no way to close it, forcing you to close and reopen the app. I also wish that without premium you could set more than one goal. Overall, a great app.",4
3249,net.daylio,"Simple but flexible and effective. You can add your own moods and activities. Has a daily reminder. My one complaint is all there pop ups about meeting achievements and asking if I want to share them. Thankfully it doesn't do it outside the app but I get a pop up of some sort almost everytime I put in an entry. It's annoying and useless. I wish I could turn it off. Otherwise, I bought premium and it works if you don't mind having to clear pop ups every day.",4
3250,net.daylio,"I've never used a mood tracker before this one. I bought the full version not even a week after using it. I like the layout and colors, the use of reminders and the options it has. I do wish it had a little more into for each day. Some days I'm in a great mood in the morning, but daily activities brings my mood down. Or vise versa, and there's no option for that. Otherwise, amazing app for my first mood tracker.",4
3251,net.daylio,Great experience with this app. i tried it for 2 weeks before I bought it on sale for 1/2 price. Being able to customize unlimited emotions has changed my experience from good to excellent. This app makes tracking the emotional ups and downs related to being Bipolar much easier than in a traditional journal or calendar. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because there was not an option for me to customize the emotion colors. I also would like to be able to upload pics as part of my journal entries.,4
3252,net.daylio,"I've been happy with this app for a few years. But the new ""inspirational quote"" addition is not beneficial to me. It's, at best, annoying. I'm guessing that several of the quotes will be discouraging. I would like the option to turn it off in settings. ETA: I contacted the developer and got a reply. Turns out that one can hide the quotes by tapping on them and pressing ""hide."" At that point, there'll be a switch in ""More"" to turn them back on.",4
3253,net.daylio,"Love the app. Such a thoughtful and effective way to monitor habits and tendencies and evaluate trends. Wonderful for finding out how various foods and activities can effect your health and moods. Nearly perfect in every way. Add a night mode and the ability to customize data comparisons and this would be a flawless app. A welcome addition would be the option to see activities linked to moods/activities that occur 24 hrs later, thus allowing the user to see broader cause and effect scenarios.",4
3254,net.daylio,"Love this app! I've been using it for over 5 years. The update to include audio just made this an absolutely incredible app. It has everything mood tracker, journal, templates (including your own), reports, audio journaling, scheduled backups, reminders. I would love to be able to include more photos in one entry. I think the current limit is 3. Also would love more than one audio clip per entry. Overall fantastic app, works great and is very flexible for my needs!",4
3255,net.daylio,"This app helps me get a good look at my moods and anything I want to know, as long as I set it up. The data is relevant and informational. It took some time and thought to customize it in the best way that worked for me, but it was worth it and easy to navigate and figure out on my own. I wish you could have more color/moods at one time- I look at the graphs a lot for an overall pattern to asses my ups and downs, grouping them by too few colors is negating the data I am trying to track with it",4
3256,net.daylio,"I am in love with the data it gives me from quick entries scattered throughout the day; it's very helpful! However, more ways of compiling the data would be nice. For example, there is a line graph that shows mood progression throughout the week, but there is not a line graph that shows mood progression throughout the day (which would be helpful for understanding when I start to get moody :P). Additionally, using the app without premium is manageable and not painfully restricting.",4
3257,net.daylio,"it's a good app, but premium is a bit to expensive. I also played for premium I'm July of 2018, and recently had to purchase it again because I switched devices. I got all of my entries back and was on the same account, but for some reason had to pay for it again. I also wish you could put pictures on your notes before saving to help save time and keep memories alive.",4
3258,net.daylio,"It is an easy app to navigate and use! I like it to track and look back on how I felt every month/week! It is cute, and you can customize it as well with what they provide! The only think I have to say is that it suddenly stopped reminding me that to do my daily entry. It just suddenly stopped? I forget easily, and with this happening I forget to put in my entry almost daily :(",4
3259,net.daylio,"this is a great alternative to bullet journaling. I was looking to start a bullet journal, but I found myself not having time to sit down and create each page. this is a great way to track my moods and keep a journal. the stats are a great added bonus. however, I wish It was a little bit more customizable for how much effort I put in to writing my entries.",4
3260,net.daylio,"So far I love this app. I have not purchased premium yet as I want to give it about a full months worth of trial before committing to a $10 purchase. I wish you could do maybe 3 goals for the free version to see how it works with multiple but I understand why they don't. Kudos to the developers for their work and their design, I like the minimal and easy to navigate UI.",4
3261,net.daylio,"This app (premium version) is worth every penny. Flexible. Customizable. Statistics, insights, and export in easy to read format. Auto backups too! The single.. only.. most midly irritating thing is that you can't select more than one emotion. Emotions are complex. You can be furious and sad. Disappointed and feeling alright. Please add the ability to select multiple emotions at once instead of having to do multiple entries if I want to log something specific.",4
3262,net.daylio,"Great app, but it has navigation issues. Calender view could be done better, and the navigation arrows to change months is all the way at the top of the screen which makes checking through months annoying. In general there needs to be a better and quicker way to see all of your entries. Scrolling through the timeline takes way too long and the calander view is annoying to use. There needs to be some sort of simplified list of all of your entries that you can scroll through and expand each entry",4
3263,net.daylio,"I've been using Daylio for years, and I've never had a problem with the app until the past couple of months. Recently, the developers added the ability to add templates & formatting to posts, and, starting about two months ago, it's been completely broken. Whenever I try to make a post with formatting, Daylio just deletes it and makes everything bold. It's incredibly frusting, and it's really disappointing to watch an update come and go and not have the problem fixed. I know they can do better.",4
3264,net.daylio,"I've been using Daylio since June to track my moods, and it's become an invaluable tool. The analytics with the weekly summary are particularly helpful being able to see at a glance what activities lead to a better or worse mental state, especially for someone like me with anxiety, depression, and dysphoria. My only real complaints are a lack of dark mode and wishing for a greater variety of icons for activities. Finding the perfect icon to represent something can be a challenge!",4
3265,net.daylio,"I love this app! It lets you quickly and easily keep track of your moods and activities from day to day and see the information in a daily entry or calendar format. It includes a variety of analysis tools and a goal tracker as well. I don't care for the app achievement awards. Hopefully a later update will allow you to fully customize mood colors, as well as display all the moods in a menu like the activities. Overall, this was everything I was looking for and more!",4
3266,net.daylio,"This has been very helpful to track patterns. I write a small note each day so I know the things that happened that day that may or may not have affected my mood. I've only been using for 1.5 weeks, so there's definitely more to learn and explore. But I have identified a couple things I would change: -it would be nice to be able to delete or change the default emotions/moods that come with the app. ""Rad"" is not a word I would use to describe myself. -it would be great if you could add more than 9 emotions/moods with the free version, especially since 5 of the 9 you cannot delete or change. Overall, it's a pretty great tool!",4
3267,net.daylio,this is a good app. the focus on streaks is a little stressful for someone with memory issues if it's been a couple days I forget what I did in a day. but it works. annoyed by all the stuff locked behind premium but I get it for no ads. my biggest frustration is I'm having issues with the search. I put in words I want to see and get entries that don't have the words. I emailed the team and haven't heard back. if they fix this I'll give a 5 for sure,4
3268,net.daylio,The app is pretty nice. My only complaint is that the option to customize mood colors is only available for premium subscribers. As someone who is color blind a lot of the preset color options look very similar so when I am looking at the calender and other stats it is very hard to differentiate the moods. If they want to have ads that's totally cool but it would be nice if I could customize the mood colors so I can tell the differences. Otherwise great tool 👍,4
3269,net.daylio,"This app is fun and very useful for tracking mood and my health. I love how customizable it is, even in the free version! I recently upgraded to the paid version because I wanted unlimited moods, not just sub categories of moods. I would love for this to be added. Additionally, random reminders would be a great addition. Having both times reminders and random ones would give me more and a better variety of data.",4
3270,net.daylio,"Best Design, but Missing Features I tried a bunch of different life/habit tracking apps, and I think this is the best for these reasons: - Clean, simple, elegant design - No overabundance of notifications - No distractions Here's where I think it needs improvement: - Right now, there is no way to quantify daily activities. ""Studied for 2 hours"" can only be recorded as ""Studied today"".",4
3271,net.daylio,"I like how I can create my own goals and have the choices oh hundreds of pictures to represent those goals. but I really don't like how I can't see the sub-goals, or step-by-step mini goals within the larger goal when seeing things through the app. now my text alerts will show some of that detail. This feature is cumbersome.",4
3272,net.daylio,"Great app. However, It lacks the ability to exclude search terms in the search bar. If you wanted to search for diary entries that contained the word ""wonderful"" you could do that. But, for example, if you wanted to search for diary entries that DON'T contain the word ""average"" there's no way to do it. Perhaps adding the ability to add a dash before the word makes it so that it excludes that word from searches. So if you typed ""-average"" it would show you all the entries that dont have that word",4
3273,net.daylio,"I like the app so far. You can choose what you are focusing on, or you can select all the options and just highlight what you are focused on today. The quotes aren't too bothersome... they are at the top and I don't have to read them. Love that the app can set reminders for a mood checkin and brain dump space, so that's helpful. Otherwise, I might not do it every day.",4
3274,net.daylio,"Good experience with free version. I love that it pops up with a reminder each day. I haven't figured out the best way to use the daily events customization. I'd like a way to note multiple moods over the day based on events (there may actually be a way, but it requires more than a couple of minutes). For a free daily mood tracker, it does the job well with a minimum of fuss.",4
3275,net.daylio,"Just finished my first full year. I like the simplicity of using a mood emoji as a one-click comment on the day when I don't have the energy for anything else. The weekly, monthly, and annual charts are motivating. This year I want to try the writing prompts and the formatting options seem a little glitchy. That area could use improvement.",4
3276,net.daylio,"This is a solid app. I paid the half off price. It needs more depth of content. Something is missing, but I appreciate its simplicity. Is a little buggy surrounding the notes. For some reason, I would add a second entry for the day, and the note for the previous entry would show up when I expected a blank note field. Overall, I can recommend.",4
3277,net.daylio,I love the app. I like that you can record as many times a day as you need. Would have given 5 stars but the only thing im not to impressed with is the line graph. Can you please make the line graph better to show more details? I almost feel like at times it doesnt reflect my data properly. Also instead of recording just activities if you could also record multiple positive and negative feelings/symptoms. I use the activities to do so but would like to see it reflect on the graph as well.,4
3278,net.daylio,"A super easy way to journal without much time commitment. Haven't been able to use this app long enough to gauge the actual impact this will have on my life and my conception of self/""how far I've come"", but it's easy to use and not annoying. Daylio offers satisfying reminders to reflect and a super simple interface that is easy to make my own. 4 stars pending 5 once I can analyze my data with a large enough sample size.",4
3279,net.daylio,"I've only been using the app for a week but I've really liked it so far. It's very easy to customize to my liking and you can go as minimal or as in depth as you want. I'd appreciate it if the built in moods and activities were capitalized, though. I went through and renamed all of them. I'd also like to see more support for long term goals - things I don't want or need reminders for multiple times a week, but maybe monthly or every X months?",4
3280,net.daylio,"Would love to see the ability to track only activities without any mood. I get that this is primarily a mood tracker, but it's evolved to be so customizable over the years. As it is now, I use Daylio to help me recognize and restructure my good and bad habits. It's a great app for that, but being able to hide the mood tracking options would help me focus so much more on setting clear goals for myself (without needing to devote any attention to how it makes me feel).",4
3281,net.daylio,"great app! i love the clean and easy interface. when i dont feel like typing for my entry, ill just use the available icons to describe my day, and when i want to, i have the option to type an entry. has almost everything. like someone else said, I really wish there was an option to upload photos. nearly perfect besides that though! :)",4
3282,net.daylio,"Good app. Simple and clean look. Features for tracking moods and activities are easy to use and customize. People undergoing CBT could greatly benefit. Reminders and achievements are helpful and encouraging. While it's not something I'd use to track habits for sake of building a routine, it is good for exploring the relationship between mood and activities. Benefits of paid version depend on your needs/preferences. But it's worth supporting the creator(s) and promoting physical and mental wellness.",4
3283,net.daylio,"Daylio is an excellent journaling app. i love the mood tracker and the ""at-a-glance"" reports. I also like that you can add moods and activities, and grouping of activities makes things a lot easier if you're like me and have fifty or more. This is a very flexible app that allows multiple entries per day. I do NOT care for the pop-ups telling me that I reached a goal and then asking if I want to share it... ummm... this is my personal diary; why would i want to share an ""achievement"" with anyone?",4
3284,net.daylio,Really good app at keeping track of your feelings and your activities. I've been using for a bit less than 2 years and have tracked all the movies I see and my thoughts on them while also keeping track of my mood. It really helps to just type out how you are feeling sometimes even if no one is gonna see it. Would like to have to ability to add pictures to days so I can see how far along I've come.,4
3285,net.daylio,"Handy for a quick log of your day with emojis and has a place for notes of things you can't Express in emojis. Nice data extrapolation features so you can tracks trends and correlations. I wish it had an option for including a photo(s) with an entry, also wish you could do the colors for the mood by selection from a color wheel rather than preset color choices. Would be nice if at end of day it combined the days entries and just showed start to end times of the mood changes.",4
3286,net.daylio,"Very useful, informative and easy to use. I love the weekly overview and the adaptability and options. Only 4 stars because I would love to see a period tracker integration feature. Changes in the menstrual cycle are inseperable from mood and it feels like a huge oversight to not provide that feature",4
3287,net.daylio,"Edit: I've logged over 1000 entries now, still love the app over all but after last update the picture adding function is glitching and really messing my entires up. I have never been able to make myself keep a journal regularly, but I really enjoy this app and have recorded an entry for approximately 170 days in a row! I like that you can easily select activities and moods and add your own and it encourages me to actually record my entry every day.",4
3288,net.daylio,"Great tracking app. Especially combined with other mental health apps, I'm doing better than I thought within a month. Winter is usually my worst time of year, but this is nice. I suggest using other apps for gratitude, daily journals, and meditation alongside this one. It helps put your flow into data. I personally keep track better.",4
3289,net.daylio,"This app has been helpful in tracking my moods. I enjoy that there are a variety of features, such as being able to select the activity and adding notes associated with the entered emotion. This app would be more useful if there was a way to track sleep as well. Having bipolar type two, I don't always feel down when I am manic. I have found a couple of ways to track sleep myself, but including that with this app could potentially help a lot of people in tracking moods and manias.",4
3290,net.daylio,"I'm a journal type of guy, but writing stuff in a journal can be too much work sometimes. This app is perfect - It's super quick and simple, you can keep track of what you do in a day AND look at a bunch of helpful stats. The only request I would have is for the activities to appear in the order in which you choose them, not in the order of which you made them.",4
3291,net.daylio,This app is really reliable and functional. I paid for premium and am able to track my moods. It's really helpful when coping with a disorder. I love changing the colors to match the seasons. I also enjoy re-reading memories from really good days to bad days and seeing my whole thought transformation. I would love the app to be available online so I can type when I don't feel like using my thumbs. Now if only someone can sync my phone and written journal 🤔💭,4
3292,net.daylio,"I love the simplicity of this app; it helps motivate me to accomplish my daily goals without sucking up a lot more of my time. If it had the option to switch among devices, I would have given it 5 stars for sure! My middle-aged eyes like to look at tablet sometimes, but I'm stuck using only my phone since that's what is always with me.",4
3293,net.daylio,"Great daily tracker. Paid version needs more emojis and symbols, better ones. Im a farmer so more farm animals and outdoorsy elements. Every app now days has so many cute ones. More color choices would also be an appreciated addition to the paid version and probably pretty easy to implement. Daylio has been helpful to me in my journey. I look forward to seeing new additions in future updates.",4
3294,net.daylio,"love the app, it has been super helpful in the few days ive used it so far. worth paying for the premium version for sure. the only complaints i have so far: i wish there was a dark mode/night mode. ive always found apps that dont have a dark mode or night mode to be too harsh on my eyes. also i think it would be nice to have to option to choose custom colors instead of picking from the options provided. it could, perhaps, be implemented as an option for people who purchased the premium version?",4
3295,net.daylio,"It's actually a really great app, I had it for about 6 days and really enjoyed it. I saw how much my moods change and things I have to change for myself. But I deleted this app, and okay I don't know what happened but it was scary and weird. I was just chilling messaging my friends when the app icon just starts appearing on and off the screen so randomly (and I start shivering cause glitching or electronics breaking scares the duck out of me.

3296,net.daylio,"Daylios has been an incredible app! I've used it since 2018. However, today I encountered an error where it will not let me add any more entries, and since this morning it has become worse - now the app crashes upon opening. I have restarted the app, cleared my cache, cleared all app data, reinstalled, everything. Nothing works. Edit: my bad. I was using the ""greater than"" and ""less than"" symbols in an attempted entry, causing the app to read parts of my written entry as data.",4
3297,net.daylio,"Really good! The only thing I wish for is that you could put in moods right from the notification tab without having to fully open the app. Sometimes I'm busy when I get the reminder to put a mood in, and I don't have time to go to the app, write something, log activities, etc. It would be more convenient to be able to just hit a smile face and move on sometimes.",4
3298,net.daylio,"Excellent app, excessive attempts to get you to pay a subscription. I'm happy with the limitations of free, and would be less annoyed by more typical non invasive ads they could make revenue from. I'd even pay a one time fee- this app is pretty great, if only they didn't hit you with multiple ads a day to pay for Premium subscription.",4
3299,net.daylio,"After looking for a journaling app for months, Daylio hits the mark. Intuitive to use and easy to backup entries and add emotions/activities. My only complaint is if you want to go back multiple years, you have to go back in month increments. You can't easily enter a specific year/date.",4
3300,net.daylio,I've most consistently used this app. I enjoy the customization. Has starter template that's able to be personalized.,4

3305,net.daylio,I use to have this all years ago I believe around 2017-2018 on my old phone and I made so many entries and the app use to be free. I wonder how I can find my old entries before? It's on my same email I have now. I just started again and there's so many features that seem really fun and interactive. I'll decide if I want the paid version or not.,4
3306,net.daylio,It is a really useful tool to see patterns in your behaviors to help you understand your situation.,4
3307,net.daylio,Only been using the app 6 days but so far I'm enjoying it. It's helping me keep track of my mental health and I especially like the ability to add pictures to each day. I've tried a few times to journal and Never kept it going but this app makes it quick and easy to throw out a few words or paragraphs depending on your mood to keep track of your days. The gentle reminder that pops up asking how your day was also helps. Would definitely recommend it.,4
3308,net.daylio,You are my Life Savior.,4
3309,net.daylio,Amazing app. User support is good,4
3310,net.daylio,There needs to be an option to add photos without losing quality. The quality of photos gets degraded so bad after adding them to this app.,4
3311,net.daylio,it's really amazing and you can log everything u do in a day!,4
3312,net.daylio,It has improved...,4
3313,net.daylio,"it's not bad, but it still isnt that useful, it's basically a digital diary but instead of writing you choose on buttons, and you can see improvements within you, I dont hate it, i think it's quite nice, but maybe something a little extra could be added",4
3314,net.daylio,"first time using it, it's okay",4
3315,net.daylio,"Love this app! But I wish we could just use colors instead of emojis for a clean look. Also I wish we could change the main color theme of the app. Most important: I think the stats page should always show 'on this day' entries of past years, not just important days. Not with a notification but just to be able to see the memory.",4
3316,net.daylio,"Great, I can't describe how much it affected my life. Well there is only one problem i have encountered till now. I.e widgets open the enteries directly instead of asking for the pass. You know anyone can judt add widget and then now our activities and goals. So pls look through it",4
3317,net.daylio,coolio,4
3318,net.daylio,I like it,4
3319,net.daylio,My therapist made me get it I love the wrapped it's so silly,4
3320,net.daylio,I apologize I love Daylio. I thought I was reviewing the play pass games.,4
3321,net.daylio,fun app that keeps track of what you do throughout the day. good for tracking habits and goals.,4
3322,net.daylio,"Overall I like it, though I would like the ability to choose the overall mood on a 1-10 scale instead of a 1-5 scale",4
3323,net.daylio,"This app is great! No ads, and I get to keep track of what I've done for the day. I use it as a way of seeing if I've completed all my tasks or my goals for the day. The only down fall imo is that you have to have premium to do alot of things on the app :/ I don't have premium and sometimes find it difficult,, I wanted to have 2 goals but since I don't have premium I can only have 1. Or I wanted to put a different emoji for an activity it's nothing big really,,",4
3324,net.daylio,Is truly amazing to see how my moods have gone up and down. And the be able to write a diary about it all makes it wonderful. Daylio is fantastic and I think it's a great mental health tool.,4
3325,net.daylio,"It's a great app but it's a little disappointing that I cannot get the breakdown for the whole year for all the activities. The report only gives you the top few ones. The year report also has a lot about mood but it's not so interesting, physical activity is more interesting (walking, running, cycling etc.). How about environmentally friendly activities? Etc.",4
3326,net.daylio,Great! Just wish the statistics were free,4
3327,net.daylio,"So far, so good. I'm excited for the end of the year and being able to look back at this. Hopefully, I'm consistent.",4
3328,net.daylio,"I used it for 3.5 years while I went through some tough stuff. I've noticed recently my emotions and symptoms are fairly evened out, so I made it a goal to track through the end of 2023. I highly recommend this ap and I'm thankful for the insight it gave me! 4 stars is just because often tge weekly reports glitched for me-minor things, but I want to provide an accurate review.",4
3329,net.daylio,"Great app. It has many features I didn't think I'd need in a dairy, but I ended up using almost every day. The only complaint is that the most random things are locked behind a pay wall, like certain emojis or just how many moods your diary can have. Wouldn't be such a big deal if the app didn't recommend premium to you so frequently. It's still a really good journal tho 8/10 :)",4
3330,net.daylio,Wonderful app to track your mood and see more clearly how activities in your life affects it.,4
3331,net.daylio,I have been using this app for a long time and I am quite satisfied with it. Many thanks to the Daylio group.,4
3332,net.daylio,Love this App! I struggled with the restore. It didn't restore a few days. Will try again,4
3333,net.daylio,Pls add an option to add Sleep timing for daily entries and average sleep timings weekly,4
3334,net.daylio,"So far, I like the app. I just wish there were fonts you can choose from.",4
3335,net.daylio,initial review,4
3336,net.daylio,"Been using it for years, Its a great app to gauge mood. Wish they would add weight tracking (I know they have other apps but who uses two apps to track things come on)",4
3337,net.daylio,Great app,4
3338,net.daylio,Great!,4
3339,net.daylio,it's fine..,4
3340,net.daylio,I like this app it's great,4
3341,net.daylio,Way too expensive.,4
3342,net.daylio,"Helps me keep track of my moods and when I look back at them, it gives me memories.",4
3343,net.daylio,I have been suffering from depression and I used this to track my emotional ups and down. But this application seems to have many more useful features like weekly and monthky reports which averages some scores like mood stability. It has only been 6 months but I wish yo use this app for many more,4
3344,net.daylio,I love the new update ☺️,4
3345,net.daylio,The free version is still quite useful.,4
3346,net.daylio,"I'm having a new bug issue. Even though it is set to remind me at 9pm, it instead didn't remind me at all on the 12th (4 hours ago). It then reminded me at 0100 on the 13th (6 minutes ago) and when I tapped the notification and made my entry, it showed me as not having entered an entry for the 12th, which is what I thought the notification was reminding me to do.",4
3347,net.daylio,Recommended,4
3348,net.daylio,I love everything but wish I could add links and videos .,4
3349,net.daylio,I like the daily reminders to put in an entry. Wish it was easier though to go back and look at my notes from past entries. I do like the analytics that track patterns in my moods.,4
3350,net.daylio,would have been 5 if I could have more than 1 goal in the free version.,4
3351,net.daylio,noce,4
3352,net.daylio,"I know that some apps need ads or reduced functionality to run. . . but i suggest keeping everything unlocked for everyone as people without money may need a tracker for things. I I apologise if my statement seems mean, i have shared the app with two people and i hope this works for them",4
3353,net.daylio,I love this application but I'm having trouble with the payment right now. Every time I click on my card it tells me to try a different method. My card is fine so what else can I do?,4
3354,net.daylio,"so far, it's been excellent, still finding my way around. but overall it's been enjoyable.",4
3355,net.daylio,beautiful app❤️❤️ But today I can't edit note.😟☹️. Thanks for responding to my problem.Now I am very much happy for this wonderful app.It is an amazing app 💕👍 One thing it is missing is I can't sync this app in my other phone so sometimes I missed days.please add sync option in free version Thank you for responding . Hope I get some solution in near future.👍,4
3356,net.daylio,"I use this app since 2019 and it's, by far, one the best app to ever exist! However, I dislike some things, especially when it comes to the recent updates... the voice memos, I love them, but I don't like the fact that I can't accelerate when I want to hear it again. Also, the fact that when the screen timeout it stops to play. I'd love if you guys could fix that. Thank you.",4
3357,net.daylio,"great way to keep track of my mood, goals, and just have a better sense of time. it helps me to have a realistic view of how i have been doing to look back on and realize that not every day is horrible. there aren't ads everywhere, but they do try to get you to buy some kind of optional subscription which gets annoying. that's probably my only complaint!",4
3358,net.daylio,"been using it for a day. interesting app. since I'm no longer in any programs , this reminds me of the daily check ins they would do about your mood and compare and contrast later. helpful I suppose",4
3359,net.daylio,It's a wonderful app,4
3360,net.daylio,Cool Beans,4
3361,net.daylio,"I've been using this app for just over a year now, and it's worked pretty well. One minor feature I would like to see is proper support for is advanced HTML editing within entries. It's technically possible in the Quick Note box, but those tags can't be edited later. It would be nice if there were an ""advanced"" toggle in the full note view to enable editing the raw formatting tags.",4
3362,net.daylio,I wanted something I could jot down my random deep thoughts I have. I Have been going through a lot these past couple years and I'm trying to focus on self love and finding myself again 💕 And this app is simple but is super cute! And has nice features.,4
3363,net.daylio,"Just in appreciation, it's a good app but always has the information with the price. If I don't want to buy it, don't put it in against",4
3364,net.daylio,actually am enjoying this app more than the ones I've tried prior. has many cool features which are available for free,4
3365,net.daylio,Good,4
3366,net.daylio,This app is great. It really helps me keep my memory in check. There are also a lot of awesome features.,4
3367,net.daylio,I just wish I could change my pin there's some sort of glitch. I had this app years ago and am looking at old entries but anytime I close the app I get locked out. I made that pin about 5 years ago and do not remember it at all,4
3368,net.daylio,very useful app and note our activities very easily,4
3369,net.daylio,I think there needs to be more space for feelings at the first sight other wise I love the app,4
3370,net.daylio,i hope you add multiple voices notes,4
3371,net.daylio,Good,4
3372,net.daylio,"Decent app. I used to use it a lot more, but for some reason I've gone back to pen and paper. But while I did use this app it was easy to use and had a lot of useful tagging / categorisation features. I prefer the free version because it's not something I want to pay for just yet. But could be a good option if you are firm about digital journaling.",4
3373,net.daylio,it's good 👍,4
3374,net.daylio,"I used to use this app all the time and it was great, now don't reach for it as much. I've been paying for it for a few years now and haven't used it. How do I cancel my subscription? I've tried everything and it's telling me I don't have subscription even though it comes up on my phone bill. Any help would be great!",4
3375,net.daylio,"Please, add ""end date"" for goals.",4
3376,net.daylio,Simple app and has all the features I want,4
3377,net.daylio,"If it allowed me to go between my tablet and phone, it would be so much better.",4
3378,net.daylio,"I use it daily, on a 664 streak right now. Only problem is that is used some outdated photo gallery picker that only let's me pick from recents, and 4 of my 50 albums on my phone, adding pictures is a hassle",4
3379,net.daylio,noice,4
3380,net.daylio,"This is a really good app that I've been using since 2021, and I just appreciate the team who made great efforts to bring it to life. However, I suggest that the ""memories"" section should be done one day at a time. For example, if today is October 21 2023, the Memories will contain journals of only October 21, the previous years, like 2022, 2021, 2020, etc. I don't like it when few weekly memories are shown. This idea will be more efficient, and I hope to see this particular feature soon. 😀",4
3381,net.daylio,"It used to be better - more focused, less distractions and superfluous features. Clearly this app has been suffering from featureitis. Hopefully the team will regain focus soon 🤞",4
3382,net.daylio,"This app is amazing. I love that you're able to write additional notes and that you're able to track your mood and other activities if you want to. The one thing I wished this app had was being able to mark / draw in the notes section while still being able to type in it. I just think it'd be handy for people like me who use a tablet and don't want to type all the time. Otherwise, I quite enjoy using this app. It has a very clean interface, and I haven't bumped into any issues while using it.",4
3383,net.daylio,"⭐Fantastic app for tracking moods & all of the various things that affect your moods. I would absolutely give it a 5th star if it had a companion app on the Pixel Watch. I would much rather be able to quickly mark what my mood is in the moment, without having to drag my phone out of my pocket. (first world problems, right? 😁) I know Wear OS 4 the the Pixel Watch 2 can monitor your stress levels, but it's just not in-depth enough for my liking. Great app, totally worth paying for. 👍",4
3384,net.daylio,"Lose a star for advertising better help. Irresponsible, and annoying.",4
3385,net.daylio,"Been using this daily for a years. I have it set daily reminder. The reminder hangs at the top of my phone scene partially covering it and unlike other pop-ups from other apps, it hangs there and never goes away. It's annoying. I may not be ready to post and I don't want an app nagging me!",4
3386,net.daylio,"This is a frankly awesome daily mood and goal tracker. However I have one small gripe with it. It seems there is no way to set activities to default to on when making new entries, or to set an activity as bad to make goals involving it lead to you reducing their occurrence as much as possible. I would appreciate if these features were added to the free version, thank you.",4
3387,net.daylio,"Update: trying out premium to see how it goes for the next year. One thing that could be improved is even though an entry has been made for the day, there is still a notification to put an entry.",4
3388,net.daylio,"Listen, I hate that tracking multiple goals is locked behind a subscription. But focusing just on what the free version does, it does it very well. The daily mood tracking is a valuable tool with great customization, even for free users. If there was an option for a lifetime license in app for $20-70, I'd pay it in an instant. I just don't do subscriptions.",4
3389,net.daylio,"it's a really easy app to use. I have fun journaling my everyday since I started using this app. though it has limited functions unless you get premium. for example, the icon or color themes. but overall it's nice.",4
3390,net.daylio,overall pretty good. has most useful features without premium. does what i need it to do.,4
3391,net.daylio,"Hello, I didn't know this app was from the creators of Pomodoro Timer Pro. Looks like that app is removed now. Please add it back, it was a good app! I haven't tried Daylio yet, but I liked the minimalist approach of the Pomodoro Timer. I also purchased it, but now it's gone.",4
3392,net.daylio,"The app is good for basic purposes. I have not upgraded as yet, but assuming has some features that would make it worth paying for. If it was my app, I would provide all features for 7 days and then either require registration and payment or lock the other features. I don't want to register to do a trial 7 days",4
3393,net.daylio,Great app but often times when I attempt to do an audio recording (5-10min) it cuts out.,4
3394,net.daylio,"daylio is a pretty good mood tracker app, but I wish you had at least three options for the emojis so you can change your mind instead of only having one choice.",4
3395,net.daylio,the stickers should be free,4
3396,net.daylio,对于懒于打字的人非常友好，只需要选择情绪、天气、事件类型等就可以完成。 订阅制。对多设备和多平台的支持不好，没有电脑和网页端，多移动端的话每次登录都要刷新备份和恢复。导出格式有限且需要订阅，不支持导入。,4
3397,net.daylio,so good!!!,4
3398,net.daylio,"Its alright, pretty functional. Has customizable moods, tags for each day, and notes for each day with formatting options such as bold, italic etc. Its nothing exceptional, so it isnt 5★, but it does what it says, and thats good enough for this app. Note I have a Play Pass subscription, so I dont know if the features I mentioned are exclusive to the premium version.",4
3399,net.daylio,I have used several apps like this one and I've yet to find one better than this one. I've used it for some years now.,4
3400,net.daylio,"When I initially started using this app, I was just clicking a few of the buttons and making very brief journal entries every day. Since then, I have started using it more and am now back into composing journal entries. It has really helped return me to journal writing as well as improve the content of my journals. There's a lot of great functionality to the app, and you can learn a lot about yourself. My only concern is data privacy.",5
3401,net.daylio,"120 days into using this app, and it's still the best of its kind I've ever used. Lots of flexibility in customizing the free version! As easy as the mood tracker makes it to keep an eye on patterns in mood changes, I've found it most useful in remembering things like ""drink water."" I *would* like the option of a few more moods and another goal enabled on the free version, but that's a minor thing. Great app!",5
3402,net.daylio,"Edit: was able to figure out switching iOS to android- had to go to ""backup and restore, advanced options, export"" NOT the ""export entries"" on the same level as ""backup and restore"". It went smoothly, after I figured that out. Hope this helps anyone else who's having an issue. Also, I've been using this app for 1664 days, and have loved using it.",5
3403,net.daylio,Have only been using a few weeks but I like it enough to get the subscription while it's on sale. I wanted something that wasn't cutesy and this ok in that department. The basic app was still pretty effective to track moods and see if there's any patterns. The subscription gives more customization and I think that gives a more accurate view of a day. Definitely works best if I check in a few times a day and can capture moods before during and after work. I like the goal features too.,5
3404,net.daylio,"Amazing app. Both the free version and paid are great, I am someone who sucks at remembering to do daily things, especially apps. And if my 540 day streak has anything to say this app is one of the only ones that has been simple and efficient enough to let me track every day, to make an entry you can take a picture or write little note and that's it. You can make goals(only one if you have the free version) And you can track habits, hobbies and stuff all of which you can customize. It's great!",5
3405,net.daylio,"I love this app, I've been using it for 6 month. It's such a good way to keep track of your mood. If you miss a day, no problem, just put the mood you felt that day in the tracker. I type paragraphs in my notes and when I open the app all of it is there to see. You can put a pin on it but you don't have too, you also can change the mood names and colors for what fits you. Good for people that don't have time to journal and for people who forget. 0 stress, hands down, best app I've downloaded! ❤",5
3406,net.daylio,"Edit: it's been three years since my last review. I can't recommend it enough. 1369 days of journaling and counting (3/6/20 start). Love the new photo and voice features. //It's pushing me to actually look at my mental health daily. I sometimes write long involved notes, and other days I just click the things I did and move on. I like how I feel when I can document that I did things I'm proud of at the end of the day. It sounds silly, but I have extreme anxiety and this makes me less anxious.",5
3407,net.daylio,"I am really enjoying Daylio. It has everything I need to do my ""self check-ins"". A journal, some categories (preset and customized), I can add pictures, voice record... I LOVE the weekly reports and I just got the yearly report. I paid the yearly subscription because I wanted some customization and data, but the free version would have been just fine. I recommend!",5
3408,net.daylio,"I've been using the app since 2021. It's helped me track my Moods, journal and digital scrapbook. What I didn't expect is that after doing daily reports for 3 years it now has enough data on me to notice trends. For instance when I accomplished one of my goals of ""sleep early"" I had a 19% decrease in mood over the course of that same day and the following day. This can help me align my goals to better support myself. I didn't expect such insight. You get what you put into this app. 100%",5
3409,net.daylio,"I would rate this 4.5, because there is always places to improve. But, this has been an instrumental tool in monitoring my moods for my mental health. I can watch and know when to contact my care team. It's a good way to keep my memories. I incentivize myself to fill it out. The layout is attractive. There are a few user friendly changes I would like to see, but that is personal preferences that not everyone may agree with.",5
3410,net.daylio,"I get the full version with Play Pass, which I LOVE! This app is fantastic. It's all the things I want out of a bullet journal, without all the annoying work. I am Autistic, and this app helps me in so many ways- emotional regulation, awareness of symptoms, tracking progress, etc. Some features I hope they add: To do lists/daily schedule Widen emotional spectrum (more nuances within each color) Weekly graphs in addition to monthly on stat page",5
3411,net.daylio,"I loved the lite version so I purchased the paid one and it helps me track my habits, sends me notifications to do tasks and create a healthy routine. Very easy to use because you select icons and there's no need to type anything. There is a text box at the bottom so sometimes I make a note of significant things. I highly recommend this app if you're looking for something easy and want to get a bird's eye view of your habits and mood.",5
3412,net.daylio,"I love this app. It really does help me track my mood and habits, which lets me know when I need to change behaviors. It gives me an opportunity to settle down each night and think about my day without pressuring me to write whole journal entries. And the privacy allows me to be very honest. Sometimes I wish I could also use it as a planner, but I don't hold that against the app. Would recommend if you want to really ser how you behave each day!",5
3413,net.daylio,"I have to take a bit to rate this app. I've been recovering from a traumatic brain injury and monitoring my moods, which have been all over the place during this time. A therapist recommended daily tracking of moods and as someone with ADHD I thought this would just be an impossible task. Then I found this app and decided it looked simple enough that I wouldn't feel overwhelmed by it. Click a mood and done, right? I've now customized it for my specific activities. 280+ consecutive days of use!",5
3414,net.daylio,"This is a great app. Really glad I bought the paid version not only for the benefits but because the small investment provides an incentive for me to use it every day so it wasn't a waste. So I do! And it makes it so easy if you don't want to write much but just want to record your overall mood and the activities in your day that contributed to that mood, and pictures & recordings & such. I wish that the backups didn't have to be on my own Google Drive, but it'd be pricy otherwise so it's fine!",5
3415,net.daylio,"*UPDATE 12/23* I'm still going strong with Daylio after 5 years! I love the MANY customizations, and if you like tracking things, this is a WIN! I went pro for a couple of reasons. 1. Automatic backup to my Google drive. 2. Ability to add more moods to the standard 5, making my entries more specific, especially when I make multiple entries on the same day (great way to document a roller coaster day). 3. I can export the wholesale shebang to my Doc as a PDF or CSV - this is amazing.",5
3416,net.daylio,"Very useful app,I get so much value out of it. Feature request: If you start an entry then switch to a different app and then launch from the icon (instead of the open apps screen) it clears all selected activities from the entry you are writing. I have over 150 activities, so if I am in the middle of an entry and accidentally re-open from the icon I lose a LOT of time. I'd really appreciate a way to avoid that. Maybe a dialog box asking whether I want to continue the old entry or start anew?",5
3417,net.daylio,"Really nice to use for mental health. Edit:12/21/2023- Still 5 stars. I've been using this daily since 2018. It has really helped with mood/mental health tracking, symptoms if I get sick or experience pain(makes doctor visits a lot easier since I can open the month and be like so this has happened daily since this date) , keeping track of how my dates go and a lot more. The customization is really great and it's easy to use. I did end up buying the premium version in like 2019 and it's great.",5
3418,net.daylio,"I absolutely love this app, I've used it for a year now and it's helped me pinpoint what benefits my life and what doesn't. I also use this app to remind myself to take my medicine and do little day to day tasks such as washing my face, brushing my teeth ect. I love that there are no ads and it doesn't send you constant notifications. I LOVE the memories feature. Being able to look back at the past has really helped me see that things do get better.",5
3419,net.daylio,"This is an app that can genuinely change your life for the better, I have been using it every single day since 2018 and it helps so much with knowing what activities best improve my mood. You get what you put in. If you don't provide detail you won't get much out of it. I like to write notes about my best/worst days so I have something to refer to. This is also super helpful for anyone who goes to therapy on a regular basis so they can easily recall past events.",5
3420,net.daylio,"I have been using Daylio for over 3 years, journaling everything that goes on in my day. It's been an amazing tool for me to keep track of my life, and also to be more mindful of my daily happenings, so they don't slip by unaware. Before I began writing about my day, I only kept track of my daily mood, and that was also very helpful. Especially the ""Year in Pixels"", where I could see how my mood was throughout the year. I highly recommend using this app as your go to journaling resource.",5
3421,net.daylio,The best tracking app I've tried. I even purchased the paid version because I love it so much. So many apps try to force habits or information on you that you don't want. It is so customizable and non intrusive. The layout is perfect and simple. It's exactly what I've wanted.,5
3422,net.daylio,"I really appreciate this app; it enhances my self-awareness and keeps me disciplined. However, there are two issues. Firstly, the backup options are limited to Google or Apple, and it would be to have a choice between the two on any device. Secondly, there's a security concern with the Android version. When I receive notifications and the app isn't active, a chart of emotions displays. Clicking on it opens the app, allowing me to read and write without entering my pin, despite having the pin on.",5
3423,net.daylio,"So far, best app I've used. Out the gate, it's aesthetically pleasing, very easy on the eyes. For me, that makes it much easier to want to use it. Daylio is also very intuitive, giving metrics across time for how often you do/complete goals and mood changes. I love how notes can be added for a more personalized entry, rather than just selecting the different options. Like I said, best app I've used.",5
3424,net.daylio,"I'm going through a type therapy that requires me to track and take notice of basically the paper version of what your app so conveniently offers. It takes a lot of stress off me trying to remember...and It's also reminding me to try harder, depression is a killer of good habits. This app has helped me keep my headspace more efficient in an unexpected way. Great idea.",5
3425,net.daylio,"I've tried a few other apps that have features like themes, entry backgrounds, stickers, etc. those are nice and tempting, but I appreciate the customized moods and activities with daylio most. i used a ""crying"" mood in another app bc I thought it was cute, but it was classified as a ""bad"" mood in that app. in daylio, ""bad"" moods can be watever i want to classify. I'll definitely request features like backgrounds from the daylio devs tho. i love this app",5
3426,net.daylio,Great way to be accountable for your health goals. There's also a daily diary where you write whatever you want about your day. There's a feature that allows you to go back and read previous journal entries to compare where you are now to then. And it keeps track of your goals which gives you incentive to fill it out every day so you don't lose your streaks. You get awards for streaks and it just gives you a sense of accomplishment to see your progress. It has categories but you can customize it,5
3427,net.daylio,"Exactly what I was looking for. Things I love about this app: - Minimal ads (the reason I chose this app) - Simple but customisable design and colors - Easy to navigate - You can choose any activity to see on the calendar. It's very satisfying to see each month with more checkmarks than the last - This app has helped me so much over the past 4 months - I use this as a habit tracker, journal and food log and no longer need a notebook and pen. Overall the best habit tracking app. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",5
3428,net.daylio,"it's a super great app. works well and allows you great control over your personal goals, tracking feelings, and also is one of the only journal apps I've found that 1: locks and 2: allows you to hold, underline and italicize your text. been looking for an app that allows that and this is the one. Well done. Well laid out and many useful features. There is no option to buy a lifetime subscription which I found on other journal apps. there is a subscription for the premium version.",5
3429,net.daylio,"Really dig it so far. Been using it for about a week. It's super easy, and can be very simple and fast, or detailed, whatever you're feeling at the moment. Really like that you can edit the moods and activities, set a couple reminders, and add seemingly as many entries for a day as you wish. Finally, LOVE the metrics. Lots of charts and ways of breaking down what you've done and said. Exactly what I wanted. Thanks!",5
3430,net.daylio,"I love the app. I've been a user for years and they always come out with unique and helpful updates. it's a very creative way to express yourself. I got the membership back when it was a one time purchase, and it's pretty cool. This app not only allows you to write in the present, but encourages growth in features like goals and reflection in features like memories. I used to have a problem with customization, but truly, the updates have gotten better over the years.",5
3431,net.daylio,"This app was recommended to me by my ADHD coach and honestly it's been life changing for me. I'm able to track everything I could ever need to keep track daily. I make several entries a day and absolutely love the goals, sections, etc. I have 2 suggestions that would make the app even better. I would love it if there was a function to be able to search for a habit/item when I make an entry. Also would love to have a sidebar where I can quickly jump to a section I'm looking for. Thanks Daylio!",5
3432,net.daylio,"Tried a bunch of diary/activity-tracking, and Daylio was the clear winner. I HONESTLY CANNOT RECOMMEND IT ENOUGH. I've been using it for over 3 years, and it just keeps getting better. The customizability is its killer feature. I use the app to track my focus and work (& have changed my categories & activities as needs evolve), while a family member uses it to track pain & health conditions (& we export data to share with doctors). I wish I could colorize activities, but I just use color emojis.",5
3433,net.daylio,"Easy to use, not overly complicated. I especially like the graphic 5 point mood scale to indicate how I felt on a particular day. My other favorite feature is the optional, open ended ""comments/journal"" part, so I can write about my day; accomplishments, ""to-do"" lists for future days, whatever!",5
3434,net.daylio,"At first, I didn't see the point of this app, but after using it for a few days, I feel like it has helped me organize my thoughts, reflect on the day, and remember things that I was thinking and/or doing in the past. I highly recommend to anyone who wants to get started journaling their thoughts. The metrics are a nice feature to, as they help you understand correlations between different activities and your mood.",5
3435,net.daylio,"The most life-changing and reliable app I've ever used. It's been 4+ years, a few device changes, and many ups and downs, but I've never lost a single entry and the app has never strayed from its original concept, only improved and improved on what they do so well. The paid version is also absolutely worth its money and transfers devices well too, which is a rare find in other apps I've seen. Endlessly versatile, incredibly motivating, and all-around completely awesome!!!",5
3436,net.daylio,"I've been using this app since 2019 and it's one of the best apps I've ever used. If you love data like me, you'll fall in love with this app. The premium version offers so many insights into your life, including how an activity affects you and the day before and after it. It also shows the relationships between activities. I especially love the Memories feature that shows me a few of my old entries to read and reflect. I've looked for alternatives but couldn't find a better journaling app.",5
3437,net.daylio,"The free version is great, but the paid version is absolutely worth it if you want to really track and use all the digital journal features. I've used a few different apps, and this is by FAR my favorite. Very customizable, visually pleasing, easy to use, you can make it as in-depth or simple as you'd like. I love the weekly reports and charts. The paid version also tracks which habits/activities affect your moods in what ways, which a feature I find very useful. Overall, an awesome journal app.",5
3438,net.daylio,"I've hunted for an app that works both when I'm doing well (will happily log things) and when I'm not (minimum effort needed). This covers both. I have the widget at the top if I don't have the energy to explain just hit which is most accurate and can come back later. Allows for adding/editing of entries, factors that may or may not be applicable, was 100% worth the premium for me.",5
3439,net.daylio,"I love this app. The fact that my entries aren't linked to any database and remain private really makes me feel better. All the customization and the reasonably low price is great and makes it manageable to keep. I wish we could add more than 3 photos, maybe like 5, but that's a mild complaint. 5/5 Really great and easy to use and customize. ♡♡♡",5
3440,net.daylio,"I got too busy during school to keep up with my bullet journal but I'm too picky to buy just any other journal. This app allowed me the flexibility of creating my own daily accountability trackers to track my habits and health practices. I love the ease of use and the notification options. I can easily get overwhelmed with annoying notifications but I was easily able to modify when I get a reminder (e.g. time, daily/not) and what kind of reminders (e.g. mood rating, short exercise). Great app!",5
3441,net.daylio,"Edit: I have had this app for over a year and it's worth it. It helps me keep track of my mood changes and also with memory recollection, I use it to pause throughout my day and take an inventory of what I've done, what I've accomplished, how I'm feeling and what I still need to do. It's worth having. It gets a bit buggy between updates but that happens. I'm happy overall and it's worth the subscription to personalize, add as many activities and goals and moods to keep track of things.",5
3442,net.daylio,"Ive been using Daylio for a few years now. I tracked my moods almost every day for nearly a year as part of therapy. It helped seal my diagnosis of bipolar disorder. It helps me see trends and themes between symptoms, behaviors and energy levels (my customizations). I can see a link between feeling a certain way, and how I generally feel before or after that. Daylio is invaluable for people with any kind of mood disorder.",5
3443,net.daylio,"Daylio is a great way to track health behaviors, build routines, and monitor moods. It allows you to create journal entries, add photos, customize almost everything, and keep track of life--in a busy world. I also enjoy the daily inspirational quotes. This app has helped me to build goals such as meditation, sleep, exercise, weight tracking, and nutrition.",5
3444,net.daylio,It does an amazing job keeping track of trends and can be fairly customized! Just using the free version is incredible and has really helped me to keep track of my mood changes. The analysis is great and I've been able to use this data to help improve my mental health for 3+ years. This is definitely one of my favorite apps on my phone and I highly recommend!!,5
3445,net.daylio,"Like it a lot, very intuitive; SUPER customizable, especially the paid version; backup and restore is v easy;cannot recommend enough as a diary AND a mood tracker Edit 9.9.23 I dislike the new way of managing your activities. The old style had trays with icons, like the activity menu in entries. With this new style, you have text lists (with icons) separated into individual pages. Moving activities between groups is much less intuitive, and much harder",5
3446,net.daylio,"Great for identifying behavioral patterns, and taking a moment to stop and consider how the day has gone. As I get older it seems like weeks pass and I barely remember what I did from day to day. Noting a few things each day helps me remember. Also, finding correlations - and maybe causation - for moods is like an interesting introspective science experiment.",5
3447,net.daylio,"I've been using this app for about 5 years and over 2000 entries and I got to say that this is great way to understand your habits. moods and preferences over a long period of time. the UI is great and I like the way you can check weekly, monthly and annual data in a simple interface. so this checks all the boxes and everything. enjoyed using this over the years and I highly recommended to anybody else who wants a tracker that can go from very simple to very elaborate depending on your needs",5
3448,net.daylio,"Edit: I contacted support, and they were very quick to respond and confirm that this app is secure regarding personal information! It's an excellent journaling app regardless! I love the customization, which you can do a lot of even without a premium subscription! The password protection is another great touch, and gives me so much peace of mind. I've been using this app off and on for years now, and it has the highest quality and reliability of anything I've ever tried!",5
3449,net.daylio,Wonderful app. The only one that's been working for me. I have tried so many but this app has such a great set up and I really love all the icons. I'm not sure if I paid anything for all the extras because it's been so long but if not it's amazing that they have no bothersome advertising and it's all very usable. I also love the wrap up at the end of the year and the goals.,5
3450,net.daylio,"Pros: This app is great for keeping track of your moods over the days, and since I have depression/anxiety/etc, being able to see the fluctuation of my moods is really helpful. It's easy and quick to make an entry and if you miss a day you can go back and fill it in. Cons: There's some adds that get in the way a tiny bit, and even though it's not a big issue they're still annoying. Also, it doesn't have a specific graph that shows what your moods are around different activities, which'd be great.",5
3451,net.daylio,"I tried to journal when I was younger but could never keep up with it. This app makes it really easy for me, and has a bunch of options, and it's very user-friendly. E.g., it reminded me to back up my data, even though they saved auto-backup as a premium feature. The ads are interspersed in my timeline, but are unobtrusive. Like, I'm going to show this app to coworkers as an example of good UX design.",5
3452,net.daylio,"Very good for tracking your mood and shady affects it. However there is a lot that is only available in premium. It us still very useful to see how your mood changes over time, and you can add photos and recordings and notes about each day along with activities. Very useful!",5
3453,net.daylio,"Quick easy way to track your moods! I've always hated keeping a diary, or anything that took too long... but when I started new routines, medications, or seeing new people, I was able to see how my mood was affected in graphs charts... and even correlations with activities! All I do, is take 2 minutes to answer a pop up that I scheduled every day at 9p. Super easy and helpful!!",5
3454,net.daylio,"This is the first mini journal app I've actually used, and it is perfect. I keep a written journal for longer life event journaling, but for small day to day things and mood tracking I love this app. Been using it for almost a month. The reminders are unobtrusive, and the customization options are great. Easily worth a few bucks to unlock the full featured version. One change I would wish for is a full color wheel for customizing the mood colors, but I found a color preset I enjoy. Great app.",5
3455,net.daylio,"Excellent app, been using daily for 3 years. Helps me reflect on things that happened and see trends in my habits. Correlating behaviors and moods is really helpful. Love the gallery feature and choosing just 1-3 pics to represent each day to look back on. Lightning fast search, makes it easy to answer questions like ""wait when did we...?"" etc. Highly recommend!",5
3456,net.daylio,"I keep topping my best on number of entrees, three years in a row! It's pretty easy to when you can set the app to remind you at good points in your day and if I don't have time for typing out an entree I have bulletpoints I can tag to drop in important data. ;] I've only done free so far but im considering the paid option because it looks like they can build better insights based on those tags and observations. 😁 The app flows smoothly, and the way to get from page to page is pretty intuitive.",5
3457,net.daylio,"I love this app, I had to get the premium. It's the only mood tracking app I've actually stayed with, I've had it since August 2021. I dont always remember to do it daily, and I oftentimes just swipe away the notifications, but it's really simple to track a mood or event, I love the customized emojis for the different moods and the ability to change the app colour, as well as the different activities. I just adore it ♡ (If you're reading this, I hope you have a great rest of your 24 hour cycle!)",5
3458,net.daylio,"I love this app. It feels like its definitely designed with the user in mind. Its easy to use, even for on your worst days, an entry only takes a few taps, and notifications aren't obnoxious or pushy. If there were to be anything to improve it, I would love to see a dark theme, and to change the colors of activities to match moods. Otherwise, an excellent app and will be supporting with premium.",5
3459,net.daylio,"Almost perfect for me. I like that I can quickly track moods and activities without having to write anything, but sometimes I would like to make a long text entry and I'm not sure if that little box could handle many characters. To be fair, I have not yet put it through a true test. It would be even beyond 5 stars, in my opinion, if instead of text I could input my own handwriting. Until then I will have to keep my physical journal around as my preferred method. Purchased and Thank you!",5
3460,net.daylio,"This app is helping me manage so much for my mental health. It was recommended to me by my therapist to help track my moods for my depression. The free version is good, but the premium is super worth it. I love that I'm able to add custom activities and such and the goal reminders are wonderful. I'm better about drinking water now and I can also set an alarm to make sure I weigh myself for weight loss. I can set all kinds of reminders and add notes when I feel necessary. I love it!",5
3461,net.daylio,"This app is awesome! I am using it to track my moods, energy levels, activities and overall health. Even a couple daily goals like stretching each morning. I have been suffering from some complex health issues and this is an extremely helpful tool to track how my moods and energy fluctuate based on activity. They include all the data and charts you could need, and the app is vibrant, easy to read and simple to use. Highly recommend.",5
3462,net.daylio,"I'm part of a DID system and this app helps us tremendously. We can catalogue what we did, make important notes to reference to later (have we used that? no, we're lazy but it's a good feature that works), and note who went to sleep (to kinda see who fronted that day) by simply editing the emotions and putting our names. it's a really simple and customizable journal with visuals and the best thing we've found so far. so, uh, keep up the good work 👍",5
3463,net.daylio,"Yay for google play pass and no ads! I am not usually into these things but this is actually great, its a little bit of everything. It bugs me at 10pm, can set the time yourself, to add an entry. You can change everything from your mood to emojis, colors and add anything, l added like 20 or 30 moods (like ""good, i think?"" Or ""meh."") and a bunch of activities.. Silly stuff like ""went outside"", etc. Excellent way to track what i did and good for me because of my friends, er mental disorders.",5
3464,net.daylio,"Recommended to me by my therapist and I love it. Helps me check in with myself and follow trends in my behavior. I like that can add/edit activities, specific to my life, as well as daily, general habits to keep. So motivational! I am a data nerd, so I adore the analytics aspect. I also like the notes section at the end of each entry; I can't get into journaling, but that little paragraph is perfect! I can revisit entries and see exactly what I felt or did, even if I just wrote some key words.",5
3465,net.daylio,"Great customization options. I have 3 different moods for each of the 5 levels. I have the activities I made organized just how I like and need them. Love dark mode and the variation of color schemes. I just realized/discovered that you can make multiple entries in a day. Has a notes section in each entry. The stats page is great too u can filter by activity and see your year in pixels too! I remember buying some upgrade(s). It was money well spent. 👍🏻to the developer, keep it up!",5
3466,net.daylio,"My psychiatrist recommended keeping a journal to track things like mood, sleep amounts, etc. Stumbled on Daylio and wow it's perfect! It's literally exactly what I was looking for in a super easy interface that is very customizable! I can track literally anything I want in here with a few taps and even keep a text journal if I'm feeling like it. It's kind of amazing how great this is (for free!) and I've actually been enjoying checking in with myself each day using Daylio :D",5
3467,net.daylio,"great app for a snap shot of overall moods/ weekly, monthly. Hoping to discover more within the app. UPDATE: I have used this app for over three years. I set the reminder for each night before bed and it is quick and easy to hit my buttons for taking, some that were customized that for my life on a routine basis. The search feature is amazing, especially when you start seeing patterns. This app has assisted my therapist, psychiatrist and myself for efficient treatments and tracking.",5
3468,net.daylio,"Newest Update: Custom color themes may seem minor, but color can be just as much help as the mood it's describing in calling out when things change. This app has been a huge help in my daily therapy in combating my bipolar disorder. It allows me to easily keep track of my mood throughout the day and see when things start taking a turn downhill and because I set multiple checkins throughout the day, I can make sure I don't let things continue to go in that direction.",5
3469,net.daylio,"I've struggled with normal paper journals in the past and this is much different. It takes about 2 minutes to write an entry making it nearly impossible to avoid. As someone who really enjoys statistics, it is incredible to see if a certain habit makes me happy or not so I can improve my daily routine. I would totally recommend Daylio.",5
3470,net.daylio,Listen I don't pay for Anything and I'm probably going to get the premium version when it's on sale again because I don't know how else to tell the developers they did an amazing job. Even if your broke and don't pay the app is fantastic and the adds aren't cumbersome. Really it's got all the features on the free version. Being able to track my moods and activities is so much easier on an app. The data compling is a huge plus and has several different layouts and ways to see your data. Love.,5
3471,net.daylio,"I actually rather enjoy this app, it's been super helpful since I've been out on long term disability to not only track my moods but the track when I'm trying new medication that the doctors are putting me on or really anything else that's going on. I also really really like the statistics that it gives, which you can export to a PDF or CSV file and I think that that is fantastic! That means that I would be able to share this or figure out when things were happening or how my moods are changing over the weeks based on what medicines I'm on in such like that.",5
3472,net.daylio,"I haven't tried many so far, but I love the simplicity of this app and the way ut creates several entries as you go through your day. I wish ""activities"" could have ratings like good, medium (good sometimes), bad. I had a bad moment, so I uninstalled an addictive app & installed learning apps. I'd like to be able to track my good vs bad. So far, I don't feel a strong need for degrees of severity (sleep) bc mood conveys that. But I'd like to be able to start/stop sleep in checkin & track that.",5
3473,net.daylio,"I love this app! I pay for an android subscription. I started it when I was pregnant with my four year old to chronicle my pregnancy journey and the habit stuck. I've been journaling every night for four years. I use hardly any of the features, except plain old journaling. But I love the yearly emoji calendar - cool graphic. Highly recommend this app. I've never had any issues with it being buggy or crashing, seamless use.",5
3474,net.daylio,"I really like the graphs, especially since I have gone through multiple life changing hurdles in the past month and a half. I am currently out of work from an emotional breakdown (I'm doing a little better, and on my way to better mental health), and this app is great for tracking my emotions; so I can find the trends, statistics, and I will eventually use the goals part of the app. I highly recommend this app, and I am grateful that it exists. I have the paid version, a very worthy purchase.",5
3475,net.daylio,"I am at a 1731 day streak. I obviously enjoy this app. *December 2018 review:* I love that you can choose your icons and rename the activities. I also like the mood chart report thing so you can sort of correlate what activities you did with you mood. Neat. Its fast and easy to use too. That takes away all the time it takes to do traditional journaling, so is great for on-the-go people. I wouldn't mind being able to connect this to my LiveJournal (which I use for traditional journaling).",5
3476,net.daylio,Great program! Very customizable. I love that I can make however many moods and activities as I want. And that I can attach notes or a full journal entry to the mood and activities notes. And I like the option of setting reminders to make entries. I'm using this app to gather mental health data. But it's also be nice as just a cool journaling app.,5
3477,net.daylio,"Daylio makes mood and habit tracking easy. Gentle and friendly daily reminders help motivate you to log your activities. It typically takes me 30 seconds or less to make an entry, so it never feels like a chore. In the same vein, because forming entries is so simple, it never feels like breaking a huge commitment if I happen to miss a day. I'm really happy with the updates that have come out recently (activity groups are amazing).",5
3478,net.daylio,"Great way to track my days and look back to see trends on what was going on while my life went up and down. Great journaling app. The only thing I would add is the ability to add attachments like daily pictures, voice recordings, heck make the app available on PC which I'm not sure it might already be available for that. All in all a great app if you lime keeping track of your daily life.",5
3479,net.daylio,"Excellent app. I suffer from bi polar type 2 disorder, and was having trouble keeping a journal every day for my doctor. This app is so easy to use, it's cute, has a simple GUI, and it aesthetically appealing. Even without the premium upgrade, I used this app everyday and had it set to remind me to update how I was doing. I can keep track of when ive taken medications, mood patterns, activities associated with moods, etc. Very insightful! I upgraded to the premium version after a week, mostly because I want to support what these lovely people are doing here with this app. I've tried so many journaling apps, but this one is really the best pocket-pal. Love it, thank you guys. ❤",5
3480,net.daylio,"Super convenient! I have been struggling to track mental and physical health metrics - journaling felt daunting but there's a lot I need to track. Daylio made it so, so much easier. I love that you can customize the main dashboard and write simple notes to accompany the symbols only when something needs explanation. Takes 2 minutes and is already helping me better manage my health.",5
3481,net.daylio,Journaling is a cornerstone habit for my life. It keeps my other habits in check and helps me re-align my internal compass when I stray from what makes me happy. How I do I it has been so easy and enjoyable with Daylio. The customizable alerts and entries. The aggregated stats. The throwback highlights that get periodically resurfaced. And the smooth and clean UI/UX of the app that has never given me any issues for the 3 years I have used it. Love this app.,5
3482,net.daylio,"I can't say enough good things about this app. Simple, clean, beautiful user interface. I've synced my data across three generations of phones and it has always restored perfectly, even before I bought the paid version! The free version is already perfect if you're just looking for a simple daily diary, but Daylio really shines when you buy the full version. I'll be honest, I wasn't sure I really wanted to pay for an app that already had everything I wanted, but now I can't imagine going back!!",5
3483,net.daylio,"Its great for what it is. It allows the user to record your emotions and activities through a fully customizable journal. The app sends you scheduled reminders to keep you consistent and also offers the option for a security code to keep strangera out of your journal. This isnt a ""Pay-to-use"" app, which is nice, but you do get more fun colors and emotions if you go the extra mile. Sooo support the developers, download the app. You'll see patterns in your life through this thing",5
3484,net.daylio,"I have tried tons of diary/mood tracker apps, and none of them have worked for me. The way that this one is set up and the fact that almost every aspect you can change to youe liking is very good to me. I enjoy making entries on this app and the way that you can also add a little note to it. It is easy to access your moods from certain days and it is overall the only diary or mood tracker app that has worked for me.",5
3485,net.daylio,"Love this app. Ive been using it for over 2 years and I love all the customizable features, colors, moods. It's fun and cute and really good for tracking depression because I can see what activities are linked with my moods. I like the many data tracking features. It's such a fantastic app, that I bought the full version when it was on sale. Fantastic find!",5
3486,net.daylio,"Good app, my new years resolution was to write in a journal every day, but I'm usually too lazy to use paper and a pen. This app is works well, and the ads don't pop up very often. You can set reminders to write an entry, and make new moods and activities. They also send a report/evaluation every once a while, based on your entries.",5
3487,net.daylio,Simple app for tracking trends in your life. While the focus is on moods the ability to track types of activities and get detailed stats by any category is awesome. There is a nice feature to setup multiple checkpoints per day which really helps craft a more in-depth picture of your life and moods. The responsive interface makes the habit building aspect of tracking dead simple and lightning fast. Was surprised when I hit my 250 day streak.,5
3488,net.daylio,"I've been using this app for a year as part of my Play Pass, and it's been very helpful. The interface is very clean and nice to look at, and customizable. You can use it to record days or moods in as light or detailed of a method as you wish. Over time, I've started writing more in depth posts to chart out my feelings and happenings. The updates bring useful features, and the whole experience is clean and smooth. I recommend it for anyone looking to keep a journal and/or work out emotions.",5
3489,net.daylio,"Absolutely loving this app, unlike other mood tracking apps you can set really great specific times and activities. Being able to quickly track how I'm feeling thoughout the day by a quick question and tapping a couple icons helps me to stick with it. It also has the benefit of not breaking up what I'm doing so much and just get back to life without disruption",5
3490,net.daylio,"love this! This is much easier to keep than a diary for me and it analyzes your mood compared to the activities you log - very insightful. My only suggestion would be to allow premium members to use a slightly larger spectrum of moods. I know we can put different moods than the stock, but they still fall under the same categories. Would be nice if i could add just a couple more in between the current one. I like that i can also set my goals and use it as a to do list of regular habits.",5
3491,net.daylio,"I really like how I am easily able to track whatever I do in order for me to form good habits with this app. The features are so user friendly, and it overall just makes you want to subscribe to premium just for the heck of it (even though I haven't). I'd reccomend this app for people who need to transform their life from a messy and unorganized and 'meh' life to an organized and 'rad' life.",5
3492,net.daylio,"So easy, it's life changing. I struggle with anxiety and wanted to track my moods, and with this app it's so easy. You can customize push notifications to give you a little prompt to log a mood, then optionally add more like activities and notes. I really like the idea of journaling but it feels like a lot of pressure to drop everything and write out things, but with Daylio it's as quick as sending a text. I've been tracking 45 days straight, and I can't wait to see what a year will look like.",5
3493,net.daylio,"I am in love with this app. It's compact, customizable and one of the best journaling tools I have found to date. It reminds me to do daily entries, so I have no excuses if I forget. Plus, the premium version (yes, I ended up wanting the other features) allows me to set and track goals. I love that they give me metrics about my moods and related activities. It helps me manage my depression and anxiety better. This is a great self-help tool. Also, auto backup saves data for me so I don't forget.",5
3494,net.daylio,As someone who experiences a lot of mood swings and emotional ups and downs its very interesting to see a visual representation of it all. I love this app and hope to keep seeing new features. I like being able to track my own activities such as anxiety or eating sweets and see how they might correspond to my moods. 10/10 would reccomend :),5
3495,net.daylio,"I've had this app for ten minutes. That said, it's pretty, it has all the functions I'm looking for, and it lets me customize all the things, which is a requirement as far as I'm concerned. Except color schemes (only presets, which seems odd). It's $5.99 for premium, not a deal breaker and allows you to add more than one goal and gives you more preset color schemes. I like the way you can add multiple moods to the default. I now have 'headache' and 'so tired' as well as 'meh' for regular days.",5
3496,net.daylio,"Efficient, effective, great UI. I enjoy this app a lot. I appreciate that it is completely private (unless you decide to share stats with the Daylio dev team). This app makes it so easy to track your mood, and there are plenty of options to do more if you choose; such as adding a little blurb about your day, tracking activities and habits, and setting goals. The customization is perfect, just enough without being overwhelming or bulky. Can set reminders, and achievements are very encouraging.",5
3497,net.daylio,"Such a great app! The premise is so simple, but this makes it so easy to quickly mark activities and type a sentence or two about what you are doing. I've been using it since summer 2018, and just purchased premium because I like the app so much. However, there is one thing, I really wish whenever you export to pdf you could choose a custom time period (like last year, for example) rather than being limited to the standard options. Overall, still great though!",5
3498,net.daylio,"Amazing app that has been fascinating to monitor over the months/years. Very user friendly, and the free version is nearly as good as the paid version. Adding new activities, then eventually watching the evolution of you actions, is really cool and helpful. Just enter the data, then watch the trends and correlations. After awhile it's quite insightful.",5
3499,net.daylio,"An amazing app that keeps track of your moods and allows you to keep notes and a diary of your day. Statistics and the caladar are interesting to look at and it's amazing how they offer so much for free. There is a premium version which is a one time payment that unlocks new themes but the free version is more than usable. If I had to make one suggestion it would be to add an option to import pictures to your entries which would be really cool. Overall, a great app!",5
3500,net.daylio,A simple and customisable app with the option to backup and export your data to CSV. Highly recommended.,5

3554,net.daylio,"It's great app to track goals you make. I use it to track anxiety attacks or migraines. it is nice you can get reports on certain activities you enter. I will say I did purchase the app. However, I used the free version for quite a few months.",5

3576,net.daylio,great app to keep track of everything,5
3577,net.daylio,"Very useful app,I get so much value out of it. Feature request: If you start an entry then switch to a different app and then launch from the icon (instead of the open apps screen) it clears all selected activities from the entry you are writing. I have over 150 activities, so if I am in the middle of an entry and accidentally re-open from the icon I lose a LOT of time. I'd really appreciate a way to avoid that. Maybe a dialog box asking whether I want to continue the old entry or start anew?",5

3582,net.daylio,"When I initially started using this app, I was just clicking a few of the buttons and making very brief journal entries every day. Since then, I have started using it more and am now back into composing journal entries. It has really helped return me to journal writing as well as improve the content of my journals. There's a lot of great functionality to the app, and you can learn a lot about yourself. My only concern is data privacy.",5
3583,net.daylio,Great insights.. worth the d/l,5
3584,net.daylio,Wonderful app. The only one that's been working for me. I have tried so many but this app has such a great set up and I really love all the icons. I'm not sure if I paid anything for all the extras because it's been so long but if not it's amazing that they have no bothersome advertising and it's all very usable. I also love the wrap up at the end of the year and the goals.,5
3585,net.daylio,it's perfect ❤,5
3586,net.daylio,Been using this app for 4 years. It's also great to use it as a diary with the bonus of being able to post pictures now. It's so much more than an emoji mood app. I love it. 👌,5

At first i was delighted because every food is there in this. but using this app made me gain weight cz it kept reminding me about food (to enter) and the calories shown are very less compared to actual calories. i verified that with packet products per gram and entire packet. they want us to buy their coaching. very bad experience. examples - nescafe coffee sachet, cup noodles, snickers chocolate",2
3858,com.healthifyme.basic,Doesn't track Sugar in food items. Sugar is the worst nutrient you can have that hampers fitness goals. Yet they don't get an option to track it. They are easy to track and create database. Seems like they are purposely hiding the sugar tracking.,2

All good fitness instructors alloted to me kept leaving them.They all would reassign clients like me to the existing instructors.This happened thrice with me.It was very frustrating as I had adjusted well and was in good sync with my original intructors.New ones wasted so much time to study how the body 'responds'.",2
3860,com.healthifyme.basic,"Just been under a day and it doesn't sync well to Google Fit, the troubleshooting options dont work. Can't give feedback. You need to switch off reminders otherwise its just a bombardment of notifications. You enter info once and then there's a constant ""7 day free trial"" reminder that you cant switch off. All this and its not been 24 hours. The good thing is the food database that's relevant to folks in India. Will update this review after a week of using it under the basic free plan.",2

3864,com.healthifyme.basic,Using a paid version now. It used to show a nice graph of the weight loss over the entire goal period. Now is shows only the tail end of the graph. Earlier versions used to revise your daily calorie intake if you were expending more calories. Currently the calorie intake is fixed. This leaves you short of calories on days that you work out more.

3866,com.healthifyme.basic,It's an efficient app for tracking but unfortunately not at all useful to me cz I wanna gain weight but all the posts and everything are related to people losing weight. It highly demotivates me seeing irrelevant posts... in fact there ain't a single post or advice related to gaining weight just a tracker is there which isn't much helpful.,2
3867,com.healthifyme.basic,Really disappointed with the unhelpful customer service. I was charged for the second month automatically when I didn't want to renew. I only use it to track my diet and don't use the smart plan. I got it by using the coupon code from CRED. They take mandatory sign in for Google and then automatically charged me for the second month without any authorization request. And now they tell me their system doesn't have the ability of refunds. This means I get to suffer for a shortfall in their system.,2

3876,com.healthifyme.basic,The step calorie burnt showing very wrong information. 740 steps showing 919 cal burnt. It cannot be more than 30-40cal burnt for such small movement. Else we will not need any movement and just burn more calories than we walk. How can calories burnt be more than steps Walked? Misleading app. Not reliable data. Lost confidence in other measurements too on this app after this. Don't recommend this app for health measurements.,2

The person didn't call at the selected time nor did inform me beforehand about the delay, which is a basic courtesy. What a waste of time!

It is a great way to know if you've had sufficient amount of everything like fiber and fat and carbs and proteins. I also love how Indian food is available in the database, which is often updated. But I'm not sure how much to rely upon the value parameters of those food items. A simple example which leads me to judging the correctness of the values is the difference between the nutrition values for 'Subway Salad' and the nutrition values if I enter individual elements of that salad separately. I would have loved it more if there was a separate section to just find out the details about a particular food item instead of having to check it by inserting it in one of my meals.

Addresses coaching related queries promptly, and up to their ability. Cons: 1. Toll free number does not work for any technical issues. 2. Raising a concern or issue was not also working 3. If you're slightly late for your studio work-outs due to technical issues or just for joining late due to fast-paced tight schedules at work, beyond 5 minutes, you are prevented from entering, and this I personally feel is wrong. This is a serious issue and needs to be rectified. All users who have booked the session have to be allowed to enter the studio work out sessions irrespective of being late or not. 4. Scheduling a call, is a wonderful system to let your coaches know when your will be free to receive their call, however there are times when the coaches call you directly. I never minded it, however there are other users who felt it to be annoying, as they might be in the middle of a class or some important meeting. I guess, all calls must be mutually agreed upon.

4438,com.healthifyme.basic,Your food database is the best among all other apps I have tried. My only concerns are: 1.

The food log doesn't sync to fitbit. All my other parameters are being tracked by fitbit and I don't want to manually enter twice in both the app,4
4439,com.healthifyme.basic,The calorie and exercise tracking is good. But the only reason I did not give 5 stars is because there's no option to set a calorie budget. The app suggests 1100cals to me which honestly is extremely low for an adult. I really hope you can enable the option for a person to set their own calorie budget or change the budget based on a person's activity level in a week or their requirement.

If I eat something with is not in list ""exactly"" as per components and I can't add it, my daily tracking goes for a toll. Bar code scanning option for food should be added. It is available in many health apps. API can be used for this scanning option. Please add that option to make it words best app.",4
4446,com.healthifyme.basic,"This app is amazing. I've been using it for a really long time now. But one thing that I'm disappointed in is, it doesn't provide accurate calories for some south Indian dishes. For example I typed neer dosa calories and it showed 30 calories in the app but the actual calories for 1 neer dosa is about 110 calories. Could you please fix this.",4
4447,com.healthifyme.basic,"This app is good to read the intake of our faily food consumption. walk sync and cal burnt is good. I have few suggestions, 1. Notes in tracking meals. - it would be better if we have option to take notes for every meal time. 2. Setting time. - if we have add time option while adding our different proportions of meals intake will be better to calculate the next time interval. i don't know whether these can be useful to all. this is just my consideration.",4
4448,com.healthifyme.basic,best application for weight management.,4
4449,com.healthifyme.basic,"This app is overall good. I dont find anything bad in it but I'd suggest you to add a column with ""number of hours slept"" if the goal is to stay fitter. I realised that because I've veen using this app for a while and everything is going great, except for the sleeping part. I'd like to have a column monitoring that too. I guess it'll help me. Thanks.",4
4450,com.healthifyme.basic,4 stars because the app needs improvement. It needs to be even more user friendly. Undoubtedly the app is excellent for achieving health goals. Only improvement required is on the technical side. A person will often look for customer care calls if in need of something. I think the minimum should be there in the app.,4
4451,com.healthifyme.basic,"Editing my previous review from 5 stars to 4 stars. The app is amazing. It has so many awesome features, however, the foods that are given don't always have the correct amount of calories or macros. An option to manually track it calories and macros suited to the products we consume would be a great feature. Other than that, no problems",4
4452,com.healthifyme.basic,"I had few problems with this App and when I pointed them out here, the service team was quick and considerate to resolve the issue very immediately. Very kind to even help me get the most preferable option. I am thankful for that. However, the App and it's services is subject to improvement. Kudos to the back-end and service team. 4 stars FOR SERVICE and not for the product.",4
4453,com.healthifyme.basic,"Overall a well thought out app, motivates you to keep track of your diet by certain nudges... Tracking each manually can get boring after some time ..i would love to see a feature that lets you scan the plate and auto fetch the contents.. i am sure the technology is out there to do this..Google lens , image scan , artificial intelligence..all the best",4
4454,com.healthifyme.basic,"Update: There was an issue with not able to search food items and had to reinstall app. Thank you for pointing out it is issue with Vivo devices. I checked the setting for Vivo app store and disabled the auto update setting that was enabled by default. Haven't faced the issue with Healthify app since then. It seems even if we install app from Google play, Vivo app store was updating the app automatically. Not giving 5 rating because of taking out meal suggestion feature from free version",4
4455,com.healthifyme.basic,"Looks like a one of a kind app, exactly what I'm looking for. This is a recommended app for those who want to ""healthify"" themselves by adjusting their meal plans as well as daily exercise. It would really help if this app also connected to MiFit, rather than just Google Fit. Since I can't find a way to send suggestions, I'm adding one here. It would also be nice to track water by ml instead of 250ml glasses (if this is possible, I can't find it).",4
4456,com.healthifyme.basic,"I really liked the studio session but I personally felt that the smart plan is not at all useful and it's a waste of money. However the studio session is really really good. The coaches are very interactive, correct the posture immediately and give good motivation to push ourself",4
4457,com.healthifyme.basic,I have been using the smart plan for almost 2 months now and it's so convenient to track calories and start beginner workout. A couple of updates would be nice in terms of changing calorie intake as per one's need and also having the option of adding specific quantity of the food intake. It's a good plan for a beginner :),4
4458,com.healthifyme.basic,The app is good enough. But I have few more suggestions which helps the users a lot. If there is a bar line for every food item we eat which indicates how healthy it is will make the users aware of it. Eating any food item counts the calorie But what's important here is eating Healthy food. If a person eats pakora then the bar should indicate a low Healthy food rating as it contains more trans fat. So the person understands that he should try to avoid eating pakora.,4
4459,com.healthifyme.basic,"Diet plan could be improved for more customization. When it suggest a meal(ex Lunch) there is no option to replace more items individually. U like few items in the suggested menu, but few not, so instead of it if you choose your preference it will be good.",4
4460,com.healthifyme.basic,Everything is great..except for how you market the app. Does it really have to be specific about weight loss. Some people are focused on gains and bulking.,4

4463,com.healthifyme.basic,App is really helpful. I've found it really interesting. But I can't edit my goals. I'm trying to edit my goals but there's no way to edit. When I click to reduce calories goals it says you'll soon be able to edit your calories intake. And app will notify when this option will be available. I'm waiting for more than 3 months still can't edit. Please it is request to update the setting so that individuals can edit their goals. Bundle of thanks,4

4467,com.healthifyme.basic,"I like the app. It contains Indian foods which other apps don't get right and the tips are informative. The customer service team is responsive, though you have to give them some time to respond to you (it's not a chat-bot, unlike other apps). Wish-list: I'd like a widget to show info like Calories Consumed/Water Consumed, so that one doesn't need to open the app to check where they stand. Thank you for the app.",4

4469,com.healthifyme.basic,Comprehensive trackers - one even for washing ur hands! Needs subscription. Though from the second you log in the coach begins to hound you for interactions. Weight loss tracker needs fixing ( lbs/kilos swap on their own). Calorie tracker shows only Indian eats. Geared around weight loss. Uninstalled as many other less intrusive apps deliver more of an international experience. However recommended for those looking for keen follow up and monitoring: would be annoying for self disciplined adult,4

4471,com.healthifyme.basic,"This app have great UX and UI, with huge database having almost all the Indian Dishes available to track.

4476,com.healthifyme.basic,This app is really really good...i loved the calorie counting feature the most cause i have to be in deficit. The only problem i faced was that my daily calorie intake goal was changing everyday!! Day before yesterday it was 1750 kcals...yesterday its was 1950 kcals and today it was 2150 kacls !! This is kinda demotivating and unreliable...plzz fix this..,4
4477,com.healthifyme.basic,Is app is really good but there are 2-3 problem 1.It auto distribut the cal. If I want more cal in morning or night and lesser in afternoon so I cannot manage that. 2.its not connecting with my smart watch 3.sleep management... if a person sleep six hours in night and two hours in morning how he can add on it. I hope you try to solve this,4
4478,com.healthifyme.basic,it's a great app if you have any fitness goal. both nutritionist and fitness coaches are very good. Even you don't need to join gym if you subscribe to healthifyme. the free version is itself very awesome. keep the good work ON.,4
4479,com.healthifyme.basic,"good app for maintaining balanced diet. But one main issue in this app is u people disturbing so badly again and again in calls to buy ur diet packages, I have told many times politely that I dont need the package and I am just using to count the calorie, but I couldn't answer like this for long time, so that I am start putting your mobile numbers in block so that I have blocked 20 mobile numbers of this app. Its Really annoying please don't do this again.🙏🏻🙏🏻",4
4480,com.healthifyme.basic,don't fall for this. the smart diet and work ot plan don't have much help. it does not even have proper gym workout plans. just the basic exercises to do at home. and they dont refund as they don't have refund policy. But customer service was helpful enough to provide the refund as it was just one hour I bought the subscription.,4
4481,com.healthifyme.basic,"Overall a Good app but There should be option where we can create our own food/ meal and add calories or macros( P,C,F) to it. Also, User should be give the option to increase/decrease the Macros intake for eg:- If app is suggesting that I should Eat 120g of protein but I want to inc that to 140g so I should be able to do that. I believe only such user friendly changes are required. Otherwise it's an amazing app having huge database.",4
4482,com.healthifyme.basic,It's an amazing app and shifts a lot of work of your shoulders when you're trying to lose weight. But it asks money for simple features that's a bit not fair. Otherwise the app is awesome.,4
4483,com.healthifyme.basic,Aeesome app but still looking forward for mote local coaches which would be still more convenient. But as far as doctor calsl are concerned didn't feel much of the use as limited calls are alloted. But overall a great app to be healthy and happy.,4
4484,com.healthifyme.basic,Hey I love the app but changes alarm time on my oneplus device automatically whenever i add the google widget for time on my screen it shows different alarm .

4485,com.healthifyme.basic,"I love this app and track my diet and water intake in it frequently, as well as how much effect it has on my waist circumference. Just one little hiccup. It no longer tracks my steps. I have linked it to Google fit. I have tried syncing them, restarting the app, restarting the phone, but the steps are just no longer counted",4
4486,com.healthifyme.basic,"The app is really good to count calories for Indians. The smart plan is useless, their AI is not capable to suggest diet or exercises properly, for instance it once suggested me to have rice, cabbage and grilled chicken! They sell it at less price just to call you and lure you into bigger plans, that's it!! So either use it for free or take the transform plan. Just never buy the smart plan it's only a trap",4
4487,com.healthifyme.basic,Its a great app. Only flaw that I can't set macros. Not even at premium. So that's disappointing. Which means I can't change to keto of atouphagy. I wish they would make it more flexible. It not about calories anymore it is important what the calories consist of.,4
4488,com.healthifyme.basic,"This app is pretty useful. A good feature would be to have the option to track a fraction of a recipe. For example, if I make a dish which serves 4 people and save it as a recipe, there is no option to track one-fourth of the dish for my meal. This feature would be very useful.",4

4490,com.healthifyme.basic,"It has wide range of foodstuffs and workouts to be entered as your record for those who always try keeping tracked their calories.

4491,com.healthifyme.basic,"Being an Indian Vegetarian, it was very hard to find the local dishes in any other app. I found almost all cuisines here. Friendly UI. Only suggestion is please minimize the premium pop-ups. Sometimes the measurements are not accurate as per the dish.",4
4492,com.healthifyme.basic,Option of alarming for diet and water is added which is very good but it just gives a small notification as a reminder. A little longer alarm can be the better option. While uploading workout there should be options like reps performed with amount of weight in each set differently.,4
4493,com.healthifyme.basic,"The app is great, but I think you should bring the feature to enter the amount of ingredients present in it so that the calories and nutrients can be more balanced and you should also add for us to customize the size of individual items for example roti. I think all this will alow this app to calculate the calories and nutrients more accurately and also a default size and ingredients option so that someone who doesn't know the quantity of ingredients or size doesn't face inconvenience. Thanks !!",4
4494,com.healthifyme.basic,Everything is well and good with this app. And it is very useful and beneficial. Coaches are very caring and response quickly. The only thing I would suggest is introduce syncing with mi fit bands. It will be very easier to sync the steps.,4

The only thing I hate is the fact that the calories count are divided into 5 and you can't change them without premium.

4800,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,Downloaded the app less than 24 hours ago and will be uninstalling it. I have heard what sounds like some type of water sound twice which made me look at my phone but it did not give me any reminder notifications. The water sound is not enough of a reminder to me especially if I don't hear it or my phone is on vibrate and I don't have any other notifications from the app.,1
4801,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"Based on my personal info, this app recommended I drink over 76 LITERS OF WATER a day. That by FAR exceeds any safe amount. That would literally kill anyone. Absolutely ridiculous! Yes, I know I adjust my goal, but the intial goal was absurd. Additionally, when the app was open, it would not appear in my Recents. Aggravating and useless.",1
4802,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,I've done everything the app has told me to do to be able to get notifications/alarms to remind me to drink water and I'm still not getting notified. I also had to watch an ad just to go to the Settings menu. That was a huge turnoff so it's getting deleted.,1
4803,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,I downloaded this app specifically to make a sound every hour that I should drink. It does not do that even though it says it does. I have given it all the permissions that it needs to function properly and still no sound nor vibration.,1
4804,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"Not trans friendly. Asks for your ""gender"" when it means sex then shows a sterotypical boy and girl dressed in blue and pink then shows the woman's full body in a bra LMAO WHY 💀 It then leaves her at the top of your screen. Other than that, the app just closes if you minimize it and it starts you off with ML, never asked me what my unit preference so you have to change it in the settings. Most water apps ask you right away. Lacks water drinking customization in general and the UI is cluttered",1
4805,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"Useless app! Tried almost for a week given all the permission to the app, no bettery restrictions and everything but still it never worked not even a single time i have got reminded from this sh!tt app... Never download. All the reviews are paid and fake",1
4806,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"The app asks when you go to bed, yet doesn't account for it at all: the app recommends you to drink after the bedtime and the day still ends at 00:00 which means that the progressbar resets to 0.",1

4809,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"I used to quite like this app but the last few times I've opened it music from presumably some ad just plays on an endless loop until I close the app. I've tried watching a video to get rid of the ads or clicking off every ad I see, but the music doesn't stop as long as the app stays open. I can't use it like this and until it's fixed, I won't use it.",1

I need to actually open my notification tray, it doesn't appear on the bar at the top or on the home screen when my phone is locked... And that's only when I'm actually getting notifications.

4812,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"The app seems neat, but I downloaded mainly because it says it syncs with health apps - what I can't find where to configure. Also didn't find a way to remove cup sizes I don't use, or to properly track other drinks such as juices. Also, doesn't set your target intake based on activity level. Overall, way too basic, it just have a fancy interface.",1
4813,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,Useless app..doesn't even remind..just shows notification,1
4814,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,Stops reminding intermittently. What's the point of this app if you have to remember to keep opening it when it has stopped,1
4815,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,I really don't like this app and specially the ads and that is not working well it just send notification and nothing else and I'm not having my phone every time with me,1
4816,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"Not great. It gives u reminders, but it desperately needs a widget or the ability to confirm that you have just drunk water from the notification, i.e. without opening the app at all. I don't want to open this app 8 times a day, and I suspect most people wouldn't if they had the option. Feels like too much of a chore.",1
4817,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"The notifications look like ads, by that I mean there is a little X to close the notification. Not a feature on ANY smartphone and the icon for the notification is the worst icon I've ever seen. Its colourful and square instead of simplistic, instead of the outline of a cup they stick their entire app icon in the notification, in colour. It also looks like a bunch of spam reviews are on this apps page too.",1
4818,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"It doesn't work, the idea of the app where u can choose how much u drink and the tips at the top of the screen are great actually but the most important feature it's the reminder, and it only reminds u when u open the app and that's helpless, the only thing that reminds me that i have to drink water itd my headache for lack of water",1
4819,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,BUYER BEWARE!!! When I downloaded this app during the setup process it automatically went to a screen that asked me to input my credit card information but assured me it was a zero charge. When I entered it - a gaming website attempted to charge my credit card $39.99. DO NOT enter a credit card on this app!!!,1
4820,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,Megabytes wastage on downloading this app simply it doesn't do the job which it created for which is pushing notification to remind me and i am the one who remind the app that i am going to drink by edition the notification bar back and forth to make work day or two then it stops again and again 2 years of trying is enough for this app,1
4821,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"I couldn't get past the set up if this app. There are only a white male and a white female characters to choose from, and the bedtime is in 24 hour. So that means once it gets to be 12 o'clock PM here, the time would change, and it would take longer to process my progress. I think there should be options for all. If you are going to have characters that look like people, then you have to provide the ability for people to choose a character that they can identify with. The same for the time.",1
4822,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"The very first time reminder was my last time I got notified though that was after setting permission from setting to run in background and auto start the application and other's.... So after that this application sadly didn't remind me at all. Things which you can improve: Number one can be from the Above-mentioned Paragraph. 2nd one can be, You guys should make an alarm clock type feature which rapidly ring to remind the person that is time to drink a Glass of water, Sadly I can't write more",1
4823,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"Its not doing its main purpose I was disappointed to see that its not reminding me to drink water, which is its main goal. I always have to check the app whens the next time to drink the water. Also did what the app told me so that the notifications will pop up. But really, nothing works. The designs and the others are ok but really, you guys need to fix this.",1
4824,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,I downloaded this app to remember when to drink water. All day passes NOTHING no notification nothing! The only notifications are at 8am and 930am no matter what! I used to have a water drinking app that would remind me every half hour to take a drink on its own. This app does not remind me to drink water at all! Not user-friendly!,1
4825,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,This app just doesn't work on my Samsung. First of all the reminder sound which is arguably the most important feature of an app like this just doesn't work. It is too quiet; with my volume turned all the way up in a silent room I can barely hear it. Even if the sound wasn't too quiet the reminder never appears despite following the instructions provided if the app doesn't work. And in the few hours I've had it installed the app has used a lot if battery. So disappointing.,1
4826,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"So many ads for such a small app!! And the app doesn't even work LOL! AT LEAST make sure your app is working properly before loading your app with a bunch of ads!! Oh, and I've tried this app on THREE different devices! They all didn't work! Reminders never go off, which is what this useless app is supposed to be for!",1
4827,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"Im not completely sure it was this app, but I had this for a while and never used it, so ofc I got rid of it. Soon after getting rid of it I started getting a virus that would pop up everytime I opened my phone, the virus was the same picture as this apps logo reminding me to ""drink water"".",1
4828,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"Keeps crashing even after phone restart. And just from barely having it installed for a day, some tips are inaccurately false. Definitely wouldn't recommend. Even paid the $3 plus some dollars to remove ads. Not worth it.",1
4829,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"It's been 4days since I installed this app, it was working good on the first day but from 2nd day it's just restarting the water count everytime I add water. Fix this bug. It's really irritating losing the count of how much water I'm drinking.",1
4830,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,Your app may have a bug that will not allow my phone to charge. Ive tried it twice and both times it knocks out charging capability. I have LG Stylo 6. Other than that the app is perfect. Let me know if u find the issue or fix it.,1
4831,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,UPDATE: app constantly crashes . Can't get into my schedule or my settings without app crashing . Hasn't worked for 2 days. Pretty good app! Can be customized to however your schedule suits.,1
4832,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"Totally waste of money... I paid for remove ads but when I open schedule reminder, it crushes. I uninstalled app because of its' crushing issues. Then I reinstalled it, it showing ads again. Also, not recovering my old water drinking data. I sent crush report so many times, but nothing fixed. Schedule reminder function is never worked. Don't pay for remove ads, don't use this app for tracking and reminder drink water. Please fix this ASAP, or give my money back.",1
4833,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,It does not help. It vibrates just for a second and does not play tone untill we take note so it is not helpful at all. It should ring the tone untill either we snooze or stop it for next drinking reminder just like alarm. Also it stops working in background sometime.,1
4834,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,It's a stupid app. It just lets you select sleep and wake up time and decides your water schedule on its own. Doesn't let you plan on your own. Doesn't even buzz inspite of giving all permissions and sound settings whatsoever. Plus you have to pay to get rid of ads. Waste of money. I better write my water intake on notepad. And anways I have to remind myself to drink water inspite of this app. This app surely doesn't even consider meal timings. It's basic logic to not drink water around meals.,1
4835,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,Not a Great app. This is a hyped one. There are lots of better apps available. This app has too many ads and it is impossible to use with ads. It does not recommend how much water one has to completed at any time that other apps provides,1
4836,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,Still asks to use your data for advertising after you paid.,1
4837,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"Great app, HORRIBLE ADS frequency Uninstalled",1
4838,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,Seems ok so far. But it doesn't care what time you set wakeup or bedtime. It goes off every our from 6am to midnight when I set it 8am to 9pm (as you aren't supposed to eat or drink 3 hours before bed) I need 2563nl a day but only tells me to drink 175ml every hour?.. Also the full screen unskippable 30 second popup ads are very very annoying.,1
4839,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"Not at all ringing even a single time although all permissions and autostart have been enabled and Battery optimization is disabled for this app... Really bad and sad.... Either it is not supported for ""Redmi Note 6 Pro"" or not supported with its Android latest version... You developers should have responsibility to upgrade these things..",1
4840,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,No alarms went off...yes there was a warning that that might happen and how to put it with 'unmonitored apps'...but not going to do that if I can help it....I'm sick at the moment and on my phone all the time but still didnt go off.,1
4841,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"When installing it asks for your height, weight, etc to determine that amount of water you should drink per day and for some reason mine was only 32 oz. Obviously not a good app with very inaccurate information, no one can survive drinking only 32 oz of water a day. Ridiculous!",1
4842,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"I cannot figure out a way to put in data for a previous day. Sometimes I fall asleep before putting in my last intake. Then I feel like a failure the next day even though I actually reached my goal. I would not recommend this app to anyone who has more on their plate than self care. In addition, this app does not let me see how many ounces I drank on pervious days, just an estimated percentage.",1
4843,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,Spams your calendar with daily multiple reminders for the next couple of months or so. The reminders stay there after uninstalling the app. It takes a lot of time to manually delete 180 days of reminders with each day having 6 or 7 reminders.,1
4844,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,This app is annoying. I have u installed it but it conti ues to pop up reminders to drink water every hour. I CANT find anywhere to stop it on my phone. Im so frustrated. I am headed to AT&T to see if they can find out how to get it off my phone. I'd give it a zero if I could!!,1
4845,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,Doesn't serve the basic purpose of notifications. Reminders are not conveyed in time. Notifications are enabled yet I don't get a reminder. Paid in the app to remove ads but now I understand why it's stupidity paying for such apps.,1
4846,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,I used several apps. There is no problem for reminding. But this one too difficult to set it. I have samsung and no firewire no cleaners but this app doesn't work correctly for me. I had to uninstall it and use another app.,1
4847,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"I set my sleep and wake timings assuming it will remind as well calculate according to that cycle. NOPE the count resets every day at 12AM even though I have mentioned I sleep way past 12AM. So basically useless if you don't have a ""normal"" sleep schedule. This app nor the developers know anything about people working in shifts. Thanks 👍🏻",1
4848,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,First I gave it 5 stars but I didn't notice that it couldn't adjust reminder according to the need that is it couldn't divide my recommend amount of water intake into equal intervals. It also divided into so many reminders that I had problem,1
4849,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"There's no option to set up notification interval. A water reminder app should let you set up every 30 minutes or every hour, etc.",1
4850,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,This app looked promising but it wanted my credit card for free activation. I've no idea how much that free activation would have cost me. I noped out of there real quick.,1
4851,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"Can't edit yesterday's log, can't even view the history for the previous day even 5 minutes after midnight. The notifications are weird and the reminders make no sense. When you have an automatic reminder to drink 200ml of water let's say at 10:30 but you log 50ml at 10:12, the reminder for 10:30 will be pushed to 11:30 - how does this make sense?",1
4852,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"It'd be super duper cool if you didn't ask your users to choose between only male or female. Hell, even if there was an option to not choose, I'd have gone further with it. Looking forward to nonbinary options!",1
4853,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"Nice app, but the ""tips"" are mainly myths that aren't true or relevant. Please take them off. It's okay to drink cold water, that is the biggest myth that you shouldn't drink it cold. Standing is better for drinking water and it's fine to drink water after using the restroom. What idiots made this app? I'll give it a 5 when the myths are taken off.",1

4860,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,App only reminded me 2x day first thing in the morning. Reporting volume drunk was in set increments & I didn't always drink 4 oz at a time so total was inaccurate.

Although it does ask for your bedtime and wake time, it does not adjust your ""day"" accordingly. It still just ends your day at midnight regardless. It makes it more complicated for me to keep track because it's splitting my water intake for one day into two.

I have a difficult time drinking water that isn't cold. I'd be more willing to drink more water that's cold than less water that's warm.

The only thing is I want to set it to remind me every 15 minutes to drink smaller portions of water so that I absorb it optimally instead of chugging a full glass and the schedule will automatically optimize for my natural schedule. It might also keep automatically changing whenever I change my sleep schedule. I want to be able to turn off the optimization if I want.,4
5631,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"Everything is simple and clear. I liked this app. Only one suggestion i would like to put up that if you can increase the duration of reminder then it will be better. The sound of the reminder is a bit faint and has a duration of only, i guess 2 seconds, that makes it real easy to go unnoticed if the phone is somewhat far. The reminder should be there for enough time so that we can act upon it. Other than that, it's a good and effective app! Nice work team! ☺️✌️",4

It could also be improved by requiring more or less consumption depending on the weather (cold, normal, warm, hot) & our daily activity (sedentary, normal, workout, intensive workout). Adds. Pros: we can customize our schedule 2 define exactly when we want to be notified to drink water and we can choose whether or not 2 be reminded after we've reached our goal.",4

The app has hints that discourage drinking water immediately after eating or immediately before and when you have a fixed schedule it is hard to juggle the times you eat with what you drink.

You don't have to worry about how many times you should drink water or how much quantity you have to take.. this app works on the data you provide like your gender and your body weight and it gives you best scientific results.

Also I would love if I could count a ""day"" as in until I go to sleep. For example if I drink my last glass of water at 0:45am I'd still like it counted for that day instead of the next!",4
5657,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"It's a very neat and simple app. Like the reminder system , but I think it can be better where there is a screen alert along with just a single sound alert , like an alarm snooze option. I am a working professional sometimes I am stuck in situations where I can't access water for next half hour. The base of this app is not to forget drinking water. I wish there is a screen alert or vibration or some other system which goes off only when we press that water has been taking. Overall love this app",4
5658,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"Suggestion : In the history tab, the Y axis of the graph should denote the quantity of the water that has been drunk rather than the goal % since we have the ability to alter the goal intake, the data of the graph might be messed up for tracking.

I was scrolling some videos on mute and suddenly the volume went up like crazy because this app gave me a notification, everything was muted before but I had to do it again after the notification... Very inconvenient if I'm in a meeting or movie and need to have my phone muted, I don't wanna silence the notifications completely either since I do rely on them while I'm at home",4
5660,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"Good app. Feature requests: dark mode, ability to remove custom sizes, and maybe it's just me but it auto-closes and I don't like that. As well, I have notifications set to silent, could we get a tray notification without having it turning the screen on.",4
5661,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,Simple but effective app to track water consumption. I like the reminder option which is very useful. Suggestions: App shows couple of reminder within sleeping hours mentioned. This can be reduced. History can be improved by maintaining amount of daily water consumption.,4
5662,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"Absolutely nice. But i guess i found one problem and that is the reminder issue. It isn't reminding me anymore because the time it is showing right now is already past time,instead of reminding me of future it is still stuck in past time and that's why. I can't reset it because i will lose the day routine.... I hope you find it.",4
5663,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"This app would be PERFECT if the option to log water from the notifications bar was added.

5664,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,Very handy and clear app. I would like to see some more incorporation of adapting the drinking sheme to actual wake times and sleep times instead of a fixed time. Like setting an alarm to wake up will start the sheme and a possibility to check-in when you go to sleep (that would make this app perfect).,4
5665,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"I love this app! It helps to have reminders during the day to get your water in. The only thing I wish you could do is change the times when you put in the amount. I don't always have my phone close enough to unlock my phone and put in the amount, but I do put in the amounts later so it looks like I have drank a lot of water at once.",4

You can enter your height and weight and it will calculate how much water u need to drink per day and will divide it by any measurement you choose as your serving like 200ml,100 ml etc. It reminds you on time . But the only feature they can improve is if it has an alarm sound so that I could hear it across the room too. The current notification is just the sound of water being poured in a glass.",4

One thing that needs be fixed is that the app does not adjust the reminder timings according to the total water reuqirements and cup amount.

5676,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,This is actually a really great app. I saw results in about 2 weeks. The only problem is it takes up too much ram due to the ads. Task manager shows it takes up about 140mb ram. It is with a heavy heart Im going to have to uninstall this. 😭😭😭😭,4
5677,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"Great free app to track and remind me to stay hydrated, with minimal ads and helpful tips, I really recommend this app for anyone looking to log their drinking habits. One thing to that I'd really love to be added is a dark mode (or a pure AMOLED dark theme) for this app as it can be quite jarring to open up in a dark environment, other than that this is the best water reminding app I have used.",4

5679,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"The app great and I like the feature that we can skip ads for 8 hours by just watching 30 sec adv. But there since things which I think the developer needs to improve. 1) There should be option to change the colour of UI. 2) A flat progress bar is more appropriate that the big round progress bar. 3) there is no option the add water of certain level. For example I can't add 200ml water. I can only add 1/4, 2/4, 3/4 like this. Please add this feature. 4)water glasses should be shown in table view",4

I don't always drink water exactly when the app tells me to, I just drink around 3/4 of a bottle when I get time.",4

5800,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"Your Discipline Matters. The app is user friendly and uncomplicated. The design is simple yet attractive so no needless distractions. The notifications tend to blend into the background after awhile which is fine since I don't want some app badgering me with a blaring tone. This app does not push you, thankfully. Just gentle reminders to stay hydrated. I would recommend if you are habitually dehydrated and want to do better.",5
5801,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"This app is perfect ! Due to health issues I desperately needed to start drinking a lot more water. I have a bad memory and this app reminds me on a customizable schedule. You can customize your intake amount that adds up, going towards a set daily goal. But what earned this app the 5 star review (above the other mentions) is that it says it does not collect personal information. That's VERY rare these days !! For a data privacy nut it's very much appreciated! It gets an A+ in my book.",5
5802,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"This app is a good source with the notifications to stay hydrated and having the choices of water amounts based on your weight. A plus are the intervals so that you don't end up intoxicating with water. The app is simply that...a reminder, not a weight loss protocol...unless you use it to your benefit for that. Changing eating habits by eating healthier along with following the hydration protocol (reminders), just may allow for shedding a few pounds. Less frequent ads would help.",5
5803,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"I have been using this app for several weeks & I love it. I use to drink plenty of water. But once I realized I needed help this was the perfect answer. It allows readjustments if the full amount is not cosumed. It tracks daily, weekly, monthly & yearly. Notifications can be customized too. 5/21/20 I had to reinstall app bc I upgraded my phone. Now I've been using it for several months. I still enjoy it as much as I originally did. Unfortunately my new phone overrides the app notifications.🤔",5
5804,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"This app works well. I like the personalization I can do to add alerts, change times, easily change measurements including custom amounts, change the tone used, etc. I also like being able to see how I'm doing by measurements and percentages in my history. I'd like a snooze on the alarm, ""I'm busy right now but I need a reminder in 10 mins or I'll forget"" idea. (That's my only negative.) I don't particularly like having to drink more water, but this app is definitely improving my odds.",5
5805,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"I am severely dehydrated so I needed something to help me remember to actually drink. I have noticed an increase of liquid intake since using the app. Recommendations: a premium to get rid of the ads, the ability to break down intact daily (not just monthly and yearly), and the ability to remove the ""cups"" that are not used so that we can completely customize it to what we drink (makes for a cleaner user experience). As someone did mention, the times do not update to the imputed time frame.",5
5806,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"Great App! You can change so many aspects... from cup size, to total volume of water each day... from time of day to turn on/off, to changing the sound/notifications. It keeps track of your water consumption, not just for the day, but for the usage history of the app (and can be erased at your leisure.) The hardest part of using this app was remembering to keep my water bottle within reach, and full. Lol Great App. Give it a try! Stay hydrated, friends.",5
5807,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"App is easy to use, encouraging, and customizable to get your ideal water goal as well as adjust what measurements of water you drink. Notifications aren't invasive, which is nice for me. If you want an actual alarm though, it may not be for you. I'm not sure about some of the tips that it gives you, but they don't impact the performance of the app.",5
5808,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"Very encouraging and makes drinking more water easier to remember! I like the little sound effect that reminds me when I'm supposed to drink. The volume for me is a bit challenging, but that's probably due to my being overweight. Hopefully I'll lose the weight easier and be able to maintain it. So far, this app has been very effective for me...in drinking more water. Too early to see any weight loss. Only been using it a week.",5
5809,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"Easy to use. Love the reminders. Tracks progress. Adjusts to personal schedule. Friends and clients get a kick out of the water reminders and when they hear this also chime in, ""it's time to drink your water,"" which greatly adds to the fun. It's difficult learning a new habit/changing a bad one. This app greatly helps in this process.",5
5810,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"I Like the simplicity of this app,but would like it a little easier to add my own measurements and the option to set up a regular measurement though instead of the other way around. I don't always drink the same amount...and it would be fun to add an accomplishment award to up the look of an icon or some award to entice the user to drink more.😁",5
5811,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"So far this app is great and the reminder for water has now got my younger daughter telling me ""mom, you need water!!"" I do like that you can set the amount of how much your target is and there is a weekly, monthly and yearly graph. I did ask for a feature request to see if they can provide a way to see the specific amount of water from a previous day in addition to the graph for the week. Otherwise it does what it says and works well!",5
5812,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"I am constantly dehydrated because I rarely drink water through the day. I keep hear the importance of drinking through out the day a half ounce of water for every pound you weigh, but never came close to that. However, after only having this app for a week or two now I have been drinking a lot more water, not always hitting that goal, but getting very close with those reminders through out the day. I am also even starting to see some positive results. This is a very good app!",5
5813,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"Day one 100% squashed it! Water is great and we all need it, BUT if you're on a weightloss or reconditioning program a certain target, is essential. And therefore what is good for us can become mundane. This helps me be accountable in real time. I like that I can choose my goal, and enter amounts as I drink them. And the water sound as a reminder is not intrusive whatsoever. Id say this is my new Bff.",5
5814,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"The Water Reminder app is very easy to use! I like that I can change the size of the cup or bottle easily and switch back and forth between different sizes. I also like the fact that if I forget to log my water throughout the day, I can go in and add it and then edit times to help me remember when I drank water.",5
5815,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,Im a pretty new user of this app. However it is quite simple to use. My favorite feature is the water reminder. I have a hard time drinking enough water but with the reminder im getting in almost my daily required amount. Ive used the food side also. Answered the questions and told me calorie requirements for desired weight. You can enter in what you ate and/or it will remind you to log your meal. It's very easy to use. Im keeping it for sure.,5
5816,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"I really enjoy this app. I really like being able to customize the amount of ounces that I want to submit for my daily water intake. The notification sounds are so fun for the reminders, and I like the stats that are shown in the history section to see how my goal is going. It's a great app and the little water drop character who gives water tips is adorable!",5
5817,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"I was terrible at keeping myself hydrated, just something I never thought of throughout the day, got caught up with being so busy. Years of kidney stones, health problems etc. This app has made me stop and drink water SEVERAL times a day, almost a game. I find the mini bottles (8oz) of water are easier for me to get down quickly. This app has helped me keep hydrated and I'm feeling so much better!",5
5818,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,This is a very simple straightforward app which reminds me to drink water. I actually forget when I get busy. This accepted a sound of a drop of water. I'm expecting it so I hear it because it also tells you the time of your next drink when you tap on the cup that you drank water. It lets you decide how much water to drink at one time and how often you want to be reminded. It doesn't put a notification over whatever you are working on. Just the drop sound. Thank you very much!,5
5819,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"Only thing I wish is that you could edit your history. At least for the prior day. Sometimes in the evening I get busy and forget to add my ounces drank and then I can't add them once it goes to the new day. So my totals end up looking short :( All in all though, I love this app. Something about the button. Please don't ever change the button. It is very satisfying to hit.",5
5820,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"Love this app! I only have three downsides, but none are bad. 1. It limits how much you can track (I know it's possible to drink too much, but I was suggested personally much more than normal, for my particular needs.) *****PLEASE don't drink crazy amounts of water without medical consultation!!!!!!!!! 2. One other is you can't track for, or view past days' intake. 3. It gives tips (WHICH IS SUPER COOL! ) but doesn't tell you why (it would be great if there were links to articles!) GREAT JOB!!",5
5821,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"It is everything I could think I would need and nothing I don't. The suggested amount of water makes sense for my size, it considers what my waking hours are, and I can adjust how much water a serving is. I can edit the time in case I drink water and forget to document it...it does what it says and does it well. Easily worth the cost to remove the already unobtrusive ads. I have noticed that I can't change the metric from ml to oz when adding water outside of my set intake amount. But still 5*.",5
5822,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"I am an admitted, ""coffee-holic""! I am trying to be a better version of myself in 2020, and this app is helping me to do just that.

I love how easy it is to navigate, and the water sound effects and data charting keeps me on track. Great app!",5

Due to phone-provider merger had 2 upgrade 2 a smartphone (really never had one); then downloaded the app 2 my android phone. EASY to modify targeted volume of water/ day and volume you consumed. Easy to remove/add/change reminder times from/to schedule. I know, me, old person, figured it out easily! It *REMINDS me on schedule*. As mentioned by others, IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE ADDITIONAL REMINDER SETTINGS such as 'REPEAT every 5 (or 10 or whatever you choose) minutes"" and REPEAT HOW MANY TIMES, example ""3 times"" I USED A DIFFERENT REMINDER TONE than the ones delivered. I downloaded and/or blue-toothed them over to my phone. COULD USE an EXPLANATION for the yellow and/or red dot on the history report. As in, why does this item have a red dot?",5
5824,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"Feeling Hydrated! I began having kidney stones at a relatively young age. The doctor recommended that I drink a certain amount of water each day, and it's higher than the average amount. I like that this app allows me to customize my goal. It's also important for me to space my water consumption out throughout the whole day, so being able to set up reminders for certain times is infinitely more helpful than just recording my progress toward an overall daily goal.",5
5825,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"Great app for tracking the amount of water I drink, there's just one thing where I can't add multiple cups at a time to my total amount quickly. Clicking the cup icon works, but interacting with it too fast just pops up the ""+8 fl oz Well done!"" message withough actually adding anything. Despite this, it's still awesome and easy to use. Another helpful thing would be to add widgets to home screen to record without opening the app.",5
5826,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,This app is perfect! It is intuitive and creating a personalized hydration plan took only a few seconds. Now I know how much water I am drinking and can track my progress over time easily. I love that the alarm is the sound of water pouring! It is distinctive and does not get lost amid other notifications.,5
5827,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,Just the mere sound of the app alarm if water being poured in a glass has improved my consciousness of the need to drink. It has dramatically helped me improve my hydration. The tracking and if the day review reveals how badly I can be on busy days when I do not intentionally being water with me. This app has been a blessing to me! Seriously!,5

It's simple, informative (and cute!), and I really dig the reminders thus far- not intrusive but I dont forget about them either. Truly one of the best apps in both content and interface I've ever encountered. And it's free! I am very grateful to have found this app. :)",5
5829,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"I've DL'd many apps to keep me on track with my health goals, most of them are too high maintenance to be useful at all.

Great concept, very effective.",5

I mostly downloaded it for something to do while I'm at work, break up the monotony but I actually ended up liking it...a lot! My only suggestion is to give the little water droplet more to say. Maybe make him say funny things along with facts after I chug some h2o? All in all, very cute, fun and helpful.

5833,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,"Awesome app! I'd like it even more if there was a way to set the reminders to go off as scheduled rather than by drinking habit. For example, if I set the reminder to go off every hour, I'd like the reminders to go off every hour, not adapt to instead go off an hour and 30 minutes because I happened to drink a little more prior. I hope I'm not the issue and just wasn't able to set it right 😅.",5
5834,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,Seems to be working well so far. I am using this as my tracker and data collection method for increasing water intake.

I like that you can personalize to fit individual needs.,5

Knowledge of what youre gaining is the best reward for apps like these",5

Pop up makes it very easy to see when to drink and once you finish your glass you just hit the Full Glass and it closes until the next time you're supposed to drink. You log in weight, wake time, sleep time, when you first begin using and it automatically calculates glasses of water needed and divides it up for you during the hours your awake.",5

Really, buy it, it's the least you can do for the great work these guys did. There are two small issues I found. not deal breaker, though. First, it needs a widget because it would be faster to confirm instead of opening and closing the app. Second, it needs a way to cancel set hours for the day without modifying the schedule.",5

5871,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,Very good it reminds you when to drink water and give useful tips wish they put an update where the tips are more which consists of facts aswell but overall its an amazing app recommended if you want to be hydrated 🫶,5

5876,com.remind.drink.water.hourly,This is a wonderful app should be installed in everyone's phone. Only after installing it I came to know that I am drinking only a meagre amount of water everyday.

6000,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"If you require consistent ambient noise in order to remain asleep, this app is not for you. It's sleep aid sounds can only be set for up to one hour and then they shut off, leaving you susceptible to being awakened by outside noises. The apps description claims you can set its ambient noise features to stay on all night but it's a lie, there is no such option. Because of this I use a separate device to provide all-night white noise, which makes this app completely unable to track my sleep well.",1
6001,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"Last 2 days the app has glitched and malfunctioned, not going off when I set the alarm (correctly). When I go to check the alarm, it shows as still set even though the time has passed and it didn't go off. When I shut it off, it disappears and doesn't show in my journal. I've been using this app for years and thought yesterday was a fluke, but now it's happened again. Worthless if I can't rely on the alarm to function as intended.",1
6002,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"Tried the free trial and wasn't impressed. Received an email 3 days before the trial ended: ""Your trial of Sleep Cycle Premium annual Subscription will end in 3 days. To continue your subscription when your trial ends, please upgrade to a paid plan. If you do not upgrade to a paid plan before your trial ends, your subscription will automatically expire."" So I did nothing, assuming it would expire, but was then automatically charged 3 days later. It was complicated to get canceled and refunded.",1
6003,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"I tried the FREE trial of this app and it said to cancel the subscription before the 14 days. I ended up not liking the app at all so I canceled my subscription but could not find it anywhere. I even looked in my other Gmail accounts JUST in case I accidentally subscribed there and nothing. Just today, I get charged for a subscription! If I'm not able to get refunded, I would be very weary and avoid to even download the free trial.",1

6005,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"It's too focused on the whiz bang features so that it misses the basic ones. Simple functions of telling it when you sleep or wake, having it silence notifications, and showing, simply, how long you slept overnight in total are brushed to the side for fancy graphics and questionable analysis aside from simple statistics.",1
6006,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"I've used this app for a couple of years, if not longer. It was the ONLY alarm clock that worked to wake me up effectively. It no longer functions at all since it updated. EDIT: The app basically showed me nearly flatlining along with incorrect data about being in bed/not in bed. Alarm has disfunctioned not going off at the correct time. App crashes. App can no longer even be opened without automatically crashing and closing before it is even open...Just tap and crash. Sent feedback already.",1
6007,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"Used to work. Was great. Now it doesn't. No analysis, no alarm. Galaxy S9+. Stopped working a week ago. I set the alarm, turn it upside down, and place it on my bed, 1 foot away from my body.

I haven't changed how I use it, but it no longer does anything.",1
6008,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"I wish it worked, as the idea behind the app is cool. But I've been manually recording my sleep for almost a year now, and every night that I used this app, the data came back wrong. One night it concluded I was fully awake during a nap, when on the contrary, I was so exhausted that I know for a fact I slept like a rock during that time. Other nights it would seem to record fine for a fraction of the night, then give some random result for the rest of the night--often telling me I was fully awake when I wasn't. Most nights, however, the data shown appeared to be completely inaccurate and unreliable as a whole. Good attempt, but I will not be downloading this app again.",1
6009,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"I have used this app for years, but the app recently has not been working as intended. The alarm does not stop when you shut it off in the app (or even if you close the app). You have to go into app options and force stop the app to stop the alarm from playing.

I think my only option is to uninstall. Made sure everything was updated. Just won't work.",1

6013,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"I've use this app for many years and have loved it. Its great for not having to wake up jarringly from a deep sleep.

That seems SUPER suspicious. Needless to say, I deleted it.",1
6015,com.northcube.sleepcycle,SUBCRIBTION ISSUE- My issue is after signing up for the free trial I could not find a way to unsubscribe from the premium subscription. This morning I was billed for a year subscription  that I was unable to opt out of through the app.  If the developer sees this I would appreciate a refund. In the mean time I'll keep looking to figure it out on my end.   As for the app itaeit they give you some cool metrics and the layout is pretty easy to use. Not something I really needed but I could see it being useful if you had trouble sleeping. I liked the wake up alarm as well.,1
6016,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"Review for the latest update that came out Jan 20: I've been happily using the app for years, but now it's too sensitive to sounds to be rendered useless. Since downloading the update, I get weird notifications about ""baby fussing"" and ""snoring"" whereas before I very rarely recorded any sounds. I don't have the premium version to check the sounds, but I'm fairly certain that at most it may be rustling noises when turning over in bed. I'm no longer using the app. Might try again with next update.",1
6017,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"If you sign up for the ""free"" trial you'd better set a reminder for when it ends, because if you don't cancel it before the""free"" trial ends, you'll get billed $29 for the first year without getting any warning or opportunity to change your mind. Also the app requires you to keep your phone plugged into your charger all night, which is terrible for your battery.",1
6018,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"Does not always work properly. Some nights it accurately detects when I am awake or asleep, but other nights, it does not detect when I get up to go to the bathroom. It often registers time awake as being asleep, even if I deliberately talk or make noise to alert the app that I am awake, and there is nothing wrong with the mic. I have always used the free version, but noticed they changed from 1-time purchase to subscription. Why would anyone want to pay a subscription for this type of app?",1
6019,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"I canceled the free trial and was still charged. No way of canceling the subscription in app either. It's hidden in the last tab of the app, under a ... menu option, just to find your account info, which links to a poorly designed web page, which just tells you to go somewhere else to cancel it. Horrible scummy experience. I'll be contacting my credit card company soon Edit: added relevant experience for cancelation process",1
6020,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"Seems more a hassle. Apparently you have to hit start each night before bed in order for it to track & shuts off if you use phone during that time. I like how Samsung Health just automatically tracks. Only thing useful is I'm able to fast forward snore recordings, which I can't do w/Samsung, honestly, do I really care? It's only 30 seconds & I don't listen everyday anyway. Just doesn't seem like anything worth paying for. Maybe if there was at least a 30 day trial to see if it was worth it.",1
6021,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"To upgrage for more features you need to buy a subscription, which I get and is fair. However it says ""Try it Free"", implying a free trial period, but when I clicked on the button, the billing period starts the same day. This seems like its either a bug or false advertising.

Suddenly the wake up mood and sleep statistics, that I have had access to for years, are premium features? And not only premium, but $30 a year? I hate the subscription model, and $30 is simply outrageous for an *alarm clock app* - especially because I have no interest in most of the bells and whistles that come with premium. I’m sure there are power users who love all the extra tools and get a good value for their $30, but I’m not one of them. I just want the features that I’ve always had that have always been free before. If there was still a one-time payment option, I would be okay with paying that out of goodwill just because I have used the app for so long and liked it. But taking away very basic free features and suddenly charging a steep subscription fee with no warning is a guaranteed way to eliminate goodwill, so now I’m just pissed and disappointed. And side note, what’s up with the backup option being a premium-only feature? I don’t need my data stored in the cloud, I just want to be able to do a one-time, manual transfer of my data from one device to another. I haven’t been able to find a way to do this without rooting my phone, which is nuts. Being able to manually migrate data to a new device should NEVER be a premium app feature. I think the only way to save this app for me is if they bring back the one-time payment for a minimalist premium tier - just let me pay $10 or something to get back the free features that I’ve always used and I’ll be happy. Otherwise, I will regretfully be looking for a new sleep tracker. I really, really want to be able to give this app a 5-star review. Like I said, I’ve been a loyal and satisfied user for years.

6208,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"Summary: After 1 week trial period, it has potential but doesn't work right for people who have trouble sleeping, and the useful features are too expensive. Details: I have severe leg cramps that make it difficult for me to fall asleep at night. I thought I'd try this app because (with the paid features) you can enter activities or other things you do during the day and it analyzes whether those things help or hinder your sleep for you. Three out of the six nights were absolutely torture because I couldn't fall asleep for hours or woke up for over an hour due to leg pain. I felt awful when I had to get up. However, the app said those were my best night's sleep, likely because I ""went to bed"" and got up at around the same time each of those nights. On the other hand, two nights I didn't go to bed until much later and let myself sleep in an hour or two later because of going to bed late. It was wonderful because I was able to fall asleep quickly and I felt much better when I woke up than those other nights! However, the app gave these nights my lowest sleep scores. Regularity is important, but these sleep score results are exactly opposite what my mind and mood were telling me the next day. I don't think the app places enough emphasis at all on actual sleep vs going to bed and getting up at the same time. If it was like $5 I'd be willing to keep trying to see if it learns better because I like the idea of the sleep notes (IF the results were accurate), but $30 every year is much too expensive for what I've experienced so far.",2

Contrast has gotten terribly annoying, with the neon orange on black background burning my eyes every time I look at it. Would be much happier if the old interface came back.",2

The button that shows what the alarm time is also only shows up some of the time. If I try to change the alarm time it won't take and resets itself to 0:00 which I assume just means it's off.

I only use it to track my quality of sleep and use the alarm feature and while it still does both these things I think there's a bug as it's always updated yet is slow, shuts down on it's own and tries to start the timer before I've set it.

6217,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"The actual app is quite good. The problem is that the developers have explicitly disallowed Android's built-in backup system from backing up the app making it impossible to transfer your data to a new phone without buying the premium cloud subscription service. They claim this is because the backup will cause problems at night, but this is not true as the backup system runs on-demand when the user specifies it to run. The only way to move data from one phone to another without paying a cloud backup fee is to root your phones. It's a shame since I actually like the functionality of the app quite a bit, but my data is held hostage by it and that has made me look for alternatives.",2

Not only that on 2 mornings it made me late for work due to no alarm.,2
6290,com.northcube.sleepcycle,Interesting app but don't bother upgrading. With the upgrade you get to listen to yourself snore and you get more 'sleep aids' that I find mostly annoying and you can't add your own. The tips aren't really eye-openers and won't change your life. The statistics are a good guide and it's nice to know how long you sleep and the quality of sleep.

I have used this for a couple of weeks now, and imo the premium version of this isn't as good as the free version of android sleep.

When actually recording sleep all it does is show the time so if you wake up in the moddle of a cycle you can't see any stats, far more unintuitive.",2

Worse however is that my phone automatically restarts once a week. After this restart, the alarm does not go off. One time I caught it, but the second time I was 2 hours late for work... This is not a problem I suffer with other alarm apps.

There are nights where I go to sleep at 80% of battery charge, and when I wake up, it's on 15%. I know the app suggests you to keep the phone charging during the night, but before this update, I never had to do that, since I rarely use my smartphone for anything else during the day, and I always keep it full when it's reaching a lower percentage.

6519,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"I've used this app on and off for a while now, and its mostly useful for seeing your sleep pattern on a chart to see how many times you reach deep sleep or wake throughout the night. The main issue I have with it is that, as far as I can tell, the result for “Sleep quality” is basically determined by sleep “quantity”, which I don’t believe is an accurate representation. For example, the other night it gave me 86% quality score event though I didn’t stay in deep sleep for long and actually woke up a few times throughout the night. Conversely, you can have few hours, be in deep sleep a lot, wake up feeling great but get a low-quality score. I’m also not a fan apps that start off giving you functions for free, like playback of snoring, and then take it away later to ask you to subscribe. Overall though, the free version is good for general sleep cycles on the chart.",3

The app turns on the alarm (quietly at first) in the half-hour window you've set, during the time you should wake up easier. As it gets closer to the end of that half hour (the time you've set to wake up by), the alarm gets louder to ensure you're up in time. I'm not sure how accurate the data is, but as far as waking me up on time, this app definitely does the job.",4
6813,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"Great app, very useful. However, if I try to use the app for my naps too, it overrides last nights sleep with that nap, which severely throws off my sleep quality rating. This is also the barrier that is preventing me from buying premium - no use analyzing my sleep further if the data it uses incomplete data from only that nap and not the night prior. Mostly used for waking up smoothly and seeing how my night sleep went in terms of alertness. If the app adds this feature, I will make it 5 stars!",4
6814,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"This app is changing my routine! In a week, I've been able to wake up 2+ hours earlier than normal and adjust fairly well. Waking up isn't nearly as painful, and for that, I am thankful!! My only complaint is how much they charge for the full version... $30/year is a bit ridiculous in my opinion. The free version will do for my purposes though.",4
6815,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"The app gave me some insights to my sleep, which I appreciate. One of the best features is the wake up window alarm where your alarm goes off when it believes you're closest to the awake state. The one thing I wish they'd include as a feature is an ""gentle alarm"" where instead of an alarm jus going off full sound, it could slowly increase in volume. Also, the app picked up both me and my wife's snoring and movements, so the accuracy was off. But in general, I did like the app and found it useful.",4
6816,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"I think the analysis is mostly accurate, though it doesn't always pick me up waking up suddenly. The % quality is sometimes higher than I expected. One thing that is off is the commentary, e.g.""you usually go to bed at 2 am, but today you dropped off at ..."" - actually no, I try to sleep well before 2 am and the graphs show that. Hopefully the app improves.",4
6817,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"This used to be a great app. Then it introduced automatic snooze, which was annoying but tolerable: it meant that when you pick up your phone to turn off the alarm, it snoozes before you can shut it off for good. Now the app has abandoned the accelerometer in favor of the microphone, which is bad for privacy. CORRECTION: There's a setting to use the accelerometer, they just don't tell you there's an alternative when they demand mic access. Go to Profile > More > Motion detection.",4
6818,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"Really good sleep app, lots of features, even with the free version. There was an update a few months ago and that made it more sensitive to noise. That's why the 4 VS 5 stars. I don't like it as much now, it picks up the fan running in the background, it picks up all of my husband's snoring or movements when it didn't used to. I don't think I get an accurate picture of my sleep when it's also picking up his. It would be nice to turn down the sensitivity on the mic.",4

I have to say, the sensation you get when waking up to this alarm at just the right moment is unlike anything I have ever experienced until now, and I wake up feeling refreshed and at peace. The app does eat ~30% of your battery life with the screen turned off, and ~60% if you leave the screen on, so charge your device unless you want it to die and miss your alarm completely.

Very sneaky design that is disappointing. I had previously declined the offer of a free 90 day trial and had expected that would be the end of it.,4

I used the motion detection for a while but it did a terrible job registering my movement.

Today, I got shamed for not going to bed at a regular time (and it was the first 10-hour night in ages). There is no way to turn off the annoying messages, or the nagging to use the new, unwanted features. Let's see how long before I get annoyed enough to ditch the app.",4
6888,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"Love the look, easy to use, info displayed is easy to read. I didn't give it a full 5 stars because I kept getting prompted to pay for the premium version to access all my stats. I also can't hear what was recorded if I snored. Overall it still tracks sleep (light and deep sleep). It also has 1 free guided visualization to listen to if you need help and 1 free nature sound and smart alarm. I find it helpful but will need to purchase to access data from previous nights.",4
6889,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"The alarm works well. It does wake me up more gently than alarms set to an exact time. But the sleep analysis is not so great. It often shows that I was asleep at times when I know I wasn't and the labelling of recorded sounds needs improvement. I grind my teeth every night and the sounds get labelled as snoring, coughing etc. Bruxism is a common enough issue to get a separate label, so I'd definitely suggest adding that. Also far too many options are only available in premium.",4
6890,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"Super helpful app!! It definitely makes waking up easier because it can tell when you're in a light phase of sleep. Also the alarm is nice to listen to compared with the usual irritating alarm. You have to buy premium to unlock a lot of features, which seems unreasonable because you can't even add helpful notes such as ""Exercised"" or ""Meditated"" without premium.",4
6891,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"This app works great. The tracking is pretty accurate and very useful. The only issue I have is that sometimes when you exit the app without turning off the alarm, when you come back to the app it won't let you stop the alarm. It will let you swipe up but there's nothing but a black screen, no other opinions. After a couple minutes it'll catch up and start working again but it's an annoying issue. Otherwise I've really enjoyed it.",4
6892,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"I love the design of the new update! However, when recording sleep by sound found that it didn't work very well and said that i was awake for most of the night... This wasn't happening before the update. Despite that, I do usually like using sleep cycle and find the update a lot more visually pleasing than the older version, and easier to navigate.",4
6893,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"mostly a great app, I've used it for over a year now. I do wish it had more features as I pay for the full thing, like the snoring recorder which doesn't seem totally accurate. and no sleep talking, which I know I do. also, there should be a pause button, because it's not super accurate if I wake up in the middle of the night it doesn't always record it. otherwise great! it's awesome to see how different activities effect my sleep.",4
6894,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"Great app! I do have a request to the developers. Would it be possible for you to add a feature which allows the app to stop playing a certain/all out of app audio sources when it detects I've fallen asleep? Imagine being able to listen to your audio books while falling asleep without worrying you'll lose your spot... I think this feature would be welcomed onto the app, even as a premium feature ;) I know you have content and it's great but audiobooks...",4
6895,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"Nice app. I like the alarms you can choose from. I also like the layout and extra features. One issue I experience is that the analysis often show the warning that not enough movements were detected. I'm using the sound detection and my phone is at the edge of my night stand almost touching the bed so I can't possibly move it closer towards me. And it still has trouble detecting movements. So my alarm almost always wakes me up at maximum time. I have an LG G6, Android.",4
6896,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"This app may not work for people that are sleeping with other nearby beds in the same room. You can use motion detection that works for a specific bed but it is not very effective. However, if you can use the microphone without anyone disturbing it is definitely great for people who want to wake up well and even improve their sleep.",4
6897,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"Mostly good 2 things. Why do I have to set the alarm Every night. It's weird that a paid alarm can't just hold a scheduled alarm clock like every other factory app does. Second, if this can measure the time I get to sleep and actually begin REM sleep. Why is there no option to set the alarm for day ""6 hours of sleep"" so then I always get the same amount of sleep regardless if I struggle to sleep one night... I'd both those features. It's very weird the first one doesn't exist.",4
6898,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"A great app that I've used for years, but the recent major update/redesign seems to have broken things. First it was getting days wrong, like displaying the day as Monday when it was Wednesday. Now it's the hours. I went to bed at around 12:30am last night, app says I went to bed at 4:55am. Hopefully the bugs can get sorted and put the app back on track.",4

I will continue to be a paid yearly subscriber (although the free version is great too; I just like a premium alarm tone.)",5
7008,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"Very easy to set up & use, & I'm just amazed at the level of detail available in this free app! (It seems quite comparable to the level of analysis received in my expensive overnight sleep study from 7years ago!). One aspect I don't like is having to leave your phone on the charger all night, as this is bad for the battery. Also, it hasn't been made clear exactly how close vertically and horizontally the phone should be to my head, for maximum accuracy.",5
7009,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"Awesome app. I don't pay for premium, but the free version is pretty awesome on its own. Very useful. I do feel like the snooze is too short at times, but that is more of a complaint about being woken up and not aboit the app as a whole. Although, if ppssible, it would be cool if the app could let you set multiple alarms in case you sleep through the firsy one, as I, in my sleepy early morning state, tend to do this quite a bit.",5
7010,com.northcube.sleepcycle,I tried the free trial. I just sent an email out to the creators because I got charged for the app before my free trial was over. I had an alarm on my phone to turn off the subscription and everything. But looking at my account I've been charged a whole day before my free trial was over. I also tried (almost) a full month of the app and was not satisfied. I'd never wake up in a good mood and the alarm goes off at the first time no matter what sleep stage you're in. Won't be back.,5
7011,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"I started using this before getting a smartwatch that tracked sleep patterns, and I've liked this app so much that I continue to use it just for the alarm functions. I really love that there's an alarm that wakes you up when it detects you're most awake in the 30 minute window, and it seems to be quite accurate at detecting wakefulness (a mixed blessing - no more trying to fall back asleep 😅). I use the free version because I don't need nor want sleep insights, and I still really like the app!",5
7012,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"What an interesting tool! I have been trying it out a little over a week. I notice my deep sleep cycles are in regular pattern. I know not to set alarm for 6 AM because I'll feel bad all day from getting jarred out of a deep sleep. If I would need to readjust my sleep schedule, I'm sure the app could help see the progress. On a side note, I do not have a nightstand. I use microphone mode with a TV & fan running. The app runs an hour before I sleep and has recorded that accurately.",5
7013,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"The alarm is soft, which I appreciate, and you can tap your bedside table with your phone on it to snooze your alarm! It can also wake you up within a period that you set to wake you up when you're sleeping light. it makes a big difference! My only complaint would be the sheer amount of information restricted by Premium Mode. Although, if you're looking for a good alarm with a bit of interesting analysis about your sleep, it's perfect!",5
7014,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"I've been using this app for years. Waking up gradually during a window where there is light sleep is so much less jarring than waking up at a set time during a deep sleep. The smart snooze is the only snooze that's ever worked for me. Occasionally it glitches and wakes me up at the wake up time with no snooze at all but that's rare. If you wake up a little too early and want to adjust your wakeup time to get a few more zzzs, you can. 10 out of 10 would recommend. Cant live without it.",5
7015,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"Like the scoring system, and the motion detection results make sense. However, my phone's ""do not disturb"" mode gets turned off when I enable the sleep tracker alarm. This means notifications can sabotage my sleep. If the goal is to help me sleep better, then this hurts more than the numbers can help. Update: played around with my ""do not disturb"" settings and resolved by not allowing alarms to override end time",5
7016,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"Really works! I have always been a skeptic when it comes to sleep apps, but I've never woken up more rested. I allow for the thirty minute window before I absolutely need to be up, and I woke up 20 minutes early feeling the best I have ever felt getting out of bed. It does, however, detect my husband and dog's snoring although it says it shouldn't. Sleeping alone it doesnt detect any ambient sounds, but caught me sleep talking and recorded it!",5
7017,com.northcube.sleepcycle,Been using this app for near 9 years. It's a powerful tool to track the quality and length of your sleep. Records snoring too ;) It is one of the most useful apps on a smartphone. It makes good use of a smartphone's capabilities by recording and displaying impressive sleep data. That's the kind of data one would have had to go to an overnight research or clinic setting to find out.,5
7018,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"Update and Response to the Dev: Thanks for the reply, I discovered the issue was my phone restarting itself every night. There seems to be no settings for this however so it's just something my phone started doing at some point. After getting a new phone the app works great again. Not sure if there's a way to fix this within the app and have it ""restart"" the sleep tracking after the phone reboots.",5
7019,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"Love this app so much! Only thing I would change is the function that lets you change the alarm time. You can change it before the alarm goes off but once you've gone into snooze mode, you can't adjust the alarm. You either have to stop the alarm and reset the time or keep snoozing. Just a small thing but still worth it for the feedback and suggestions!",5
7020,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"Serves me well, supplying a good estimate of how well I slept each night and helping me keeping track of things I think may affect my sleep. In the past I have used sleep aids, though in recent months I have mostly stopped using them. Great to have multiple modes - I almost always use the simple alarm, set to the time I want to wake up every morning, but occasionally I find it good to wake up within a half-hour range. Some day, it might be good to have a more advanced analysis of things that affect my sleep, taking into account the possible interactions of the factors. But anyone who's not a statistician will prefer what we currently have.",5
7021,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"this alarm works great and does what it sets out to. waking up in the morning is much easier, and the microphone alarm works even with a fan going. when i originally bought this app, the additional stats were included, but are now behind an additional subscription paywall. UPDATE: as a previous purchaser i was able to unlock lost features. 5 stars.",5

It's user friendly, has multiple options for wake-up/alarm & sleep tracking. The high quality of the sleep tracking makes the yearly subscription more like an investment in your health if your a data junkie.🤓 There are sleep aids to assist in falling asleep, many different soothing sounds, music, stories, even poems. Excellent job Sleep Cycle AB!",5
7023,com.northcube.sleepcycle,A nice alarm that wakes me up when I'm the closest to being awake. It also tracks what goes on during the night. Example would be if I'm coughing or shoring the app will pick that up and tell me. Overall I would recommend this app to anyone who is tired of alarms that jolt you awake. Or have problems sleeping and want to figure out what happens when they sleep.,5

I am a snoozer, after the time frame is over that you chose to wake up you can't snooze anymore. I don't like it when it runs out, but it's actually useful for being up on time. If you choose to wake up between 5 and 530 then you can't snooze the alarm anymore past 5:30.",5
7025,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"I've been using this app for a week and I'm finding it very interesting and useful. It's helping me understand why I always wake up tired and it's motivating me to be more consistent about getting proper rest. I really appreciate all the statistics tracking of things like snoring, coughing, quality of sleep, and the ability to enter things that may have affected sleep quality. But I need the who is snoring feature that is in the iPhone version! Great app. Recommend. Thank you!",5
7026,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"I use accelerometer rather than microphone so I get an accurate account of my sleep (microphone picks up things like fans, heaters, radio or television in the next room etc. causing inaccurate readings. The microphone can't differentiate between a heater kicking on and a snore so if you don't live in a sound proof room I suggest trying accelerometer). I have the basic application so all I can do is track my nights sleep but since that what I wanted to do it is fine.",5
7027,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"I was sceptical at first but this app really works!! I have a hard time waking up in the morning and as a result I am most of the time late. However, this app listens to how you move at night and wakes you up when it is easiest for you and it really works! I typically woke up around 7:20 each morning but now it's waking me up very easily at like 6:50! It's actually insane you gotta try it!",5
7028,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"Only have the free version but, it records my sleep patterns better than any smart watch could. It listens for any movement in bed, like sheets rustling, it listens to how you breath as your breathing slows down when you sleep and it gives you graph to show how you slept. It's just an all around amazing app. Highly recommended.",5
7029,com.northcube.sleepcycle,It's a very nice option when you want a good alarm. There are not many alarm sounds and you do need to pay for a full experiance but overall it is a good way to check how you sleep and when. This app allows you to oversee when you sleep by hearing your snores. This is totally free which I think is great becuase I am not a person with much money.,5
7030,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"Great app for tracking your sleep. I'm doing the 30 day free trial to get the full functionality of the app. I'm not sure how it works but it does a good job at measuring your sleep cycles. I also like how it will record your snoring and allows for playback so you can tell if you snore heavily. Really enjoying this app so far, as if i needed another reason to get excited to go to bed at night. You can use it to track your naps as well but it lumps nap data into your nightly sleep data.",5
7031,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"I appreciate the energy that went into creating this app. While the premium version is too expensive for me, I get by great with the free features, especially the intuitive wake up alarm.

I have a weird work schedule and my sleep patterns have been challenging, especially since when I try to wake up early (for me) I'm far more tired than I should be because I'm invariably in a deep sleep when my alarm sounds, making me turn it off and fall back into bed. Will update if for some crazy reason it all goes south, but for now I'm obsessed with it and have told 3 people to get this app.",5

I've discovered that in using this app, I wake up not feeling like trash and more like i just woke up feeling rested instead. It has a very gentle awakening alarm sound as well and very well functioning smart snooze feature. Links with google health too! I suggest this app for anyone that works an early morning job and needs good sleep or anyone that wants to better improve their sleep schedule.",5
7036,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"I use it on the Samsung S 10+ 2nd gen it works great. I have used this app for abou 7 years now I was happy when ya put the distant thunder on the sound.

But the program itself telling me how long in bed and how long asleep and how well x i slept compared to others. Good job well done",5

It helps me fall asleep, tracks my sleep cycles, records my snoring and I can compare how my deep sleep is effected while snoring. It is very simple to look at the data and interpret it in my own. I would like to take it a step further as the app develops. This is not the first similar app that I have tried, but definitely the first that I will continue to use .",5
7038,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"I really like all the features on this app and the information gathered. More people should use an app like this and share their findings with doctors.

This is the only app I have ever had the desire to pay for!! Highly recommended.",5
7039,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"This app is amazing. I used it for a long time on the free version just because I was interested about my sleep patterns. A few months ago, I decided to pay for the full version and I have not regretted it a single time. Using the sleep aids in the app, I have yet to take longer than 15 minutes to be sound asleep. In addition, the fee is annual and I think it was only $25 if I remember correctly! I 100% recommend the full version if you have trouble sleeping.",5
7040,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"It's good to see what happens while you are asleep. Once you figure out how you feel between light, deep, and REM sleep it's a lot easier to wake up feeling refreshed and energetic rather than drained thanks to the sleep timer that wakes you when you at the lightest point in sleep near your wake up time. This app helped to stabilize my sleep patterns and helped to gain a more dependable expectation and routine for sleep.",5

Excellent backup capability and sound detection tech for figuring out your schedule. Recommend purchasing the backup so you have historical data. In my case the app helps me about 20% of the time to wake up less cranky, so I'll take 20% over the 0% a regular alarm gives me!",5
7042,com.northcube.sleepcycle,This app is really cool and an interesting way to monitor sleep. On top of that it's subscription is way cool too with many stats on what your nightly sleep is like.

I love all the features but I especially love that the sound feature only captures noises that I make and not my husband, who has sleep apnea. Experienced no issues when I recently switched to a new phone or with any new updates. Overall, I think this is a very good app and believe that the cost for the premium is worth it.",5

I've slept with my phone under my pillow so it can sense me shifting around to wake me up. None of it worked. This app, though... has been waking me up very peacefully. And I'm feeling awake every morning. I'm not fighting myself. I'm just waking up naturally. It's weird that it works so well... So I'm pretty sure the creators of this app are part of a dark coven of witches. It's truly the only explanation.",5
7045,com.northcube.sleepcycle,I'm pretty happy with it so far. I'm just using the free version which comes with the sleep cycle monitor and alarm which is pretty much all you need. There are some minor metrics as well if you want to track sleep patterns and whatnot. The premium looks to have a lot more metrics that can be used to determine what affects your sleep. I haven't tried it though. Seems fairly expensive for a premium subscription.,5
7046,com.northcube.sleepcycle,"I'm not sure what everybody's talking about.. The app is free! Just because someone asks you to subscribe, doesn't mean you have to. It's an alarm that will wake you up, and track your sleep each night. Extra little details about your sleep pattern, are premium. This app is free and works amazing. I really don't understand what that guy was talking about when he said you have to subscribe to use it. I just wanted to let people know that, because this might be the help someone's been looking for.",5

Like for some people it's hard to fall asleep and takes time, they don't want to constantly update the wake up time to get 8 hrs of sleep, so an automatic system would be great that detects when the user falls asleep and wake them up after 8 or 9 hr or in their desired amount of hours.

7200,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,SKETCHY. Downloaded this app and logged in with my Google account. Suddenly I started receiving sketchy emails and spam text messages. One of the emails stated that my credit card got disconnected from Google Pay. This all happened within 3 hours I've used the app and while having no other activities on my phone since I was working out and working. Can't trust this app.,1
7201,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"This app used to be good, the old ads weren't invasive and constantly popping up on your screen. The banner ads are fine. However, the ads they play now for free users block the whole screen and they come up constantly. Like 5-6 videos every minute. I got tired of constantly having to watch video ads. There are other FREE fasting trackers with little to no ads on the playstore. So I have uninstalled this one and went with another. I suggest using a different tracker.",1
7202,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I love the interface, personalization capabilities, and dark mode features, but I HATE the blood sugar rising notifications! I want to be able to turn off everything except the fasting countdown in my taskbar! And for some reason, the app has suddenly started vibrating my phone like an alert, and I can't get it to stop except to turn off all notifications, which I don't want to do! I'm about to delete the whole thing and try a different app!",1
7203,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Too much spam, pop-ups, notifications, even after trying to turn them off. Even putting the notifications on silent doesn't get rid of them, and every time I open the app it tries to get me to upgrade. I also dislike how the UI requires multiple affirmations that you are finished or starting a fast. I have concluded or started a fast only to open the app the next day or hours later to realize that bc I hadn't hit the second round of affirmations that it never stopped or turned on.",1
7204,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"It has a lot of potential, but the ads are insane. Full screen ad pop's up, and you have to wait 5 secs for the option to skip the video. Then a tiny little X appears, but doesn't do anything. The ad flickers, but won't go away no matter how many times you hit the X. You have to stop the app and restart it every time there's an ad.",1
7205,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Great until the intrusive ads. It used to be one of my favorite trackers but now there are too many intrusive full screen ads. EDIT: Now the full screen ads don't have a close button and don't allow you to back out of them, forcing you to close the app and open it again. It's too bad because this was a great app. I understand the need for ads in the free version, but this type is completely unnecessary and unacceptable.",1
7206,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Thanks for your reply, but it's not the subscription I have a problem with. It's something inside your app that kicks me out of premium for having multiple email accounts on my device, even though I only have and use ONE email account for your app. I paused my subscription instead of cancelling it, it starts back up at the end of July, hopefully by then, whatever bug this is is fixed. I really don't want to permanently get rid of such an amazing app for something I'm sure is fixable.",1
7207,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"As of today, it began to have 60 second unclosable video ads whenever I open the app. This is totally unacceptable for a tracker app; I am trying to record *when something happened*; I need to get in and out as fast as possible. Makes the app unusable. Am finding a new one. EDIT: instructions given in your reply are impossible. The problem ads are app install ads with no way to open in browser or get a ""link"". More importantly, it seems to be an entire ad format, not specific to one advertiser.",1
7208,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"This is a very poor performing app. Unfortunately I paid $19.99 for the year, so that's money literally down the drain. The app is supposed to stay in notifications but periodically disappears. While recording either eating time or fasting time, the timer will just stop and also disappear. This flaw throws everything off because now I have no idea what time I started. This defeats the purpose of the app in the first place because it's designed to help you keep track but fails to do so too much!",1
7209,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,This app used to be amazing. I even paid for the ad-free version a couple years ago. I stopped fasting but recently wanted to get back into it and now they want me to pay for a subscription. Scheduling fasts only lasts 7 days and then you have to set the plan up all over again and it doesn't remember the settings you used for the previous plan. Such a PITA now I'll be finding a different app.,1
7210,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I am not really able to speak on the app's performance since it decided to kick off my experience with an ad that had no close button. I had not even customized any settings, just opened the app and it started playing. Ads should not be the introduction to your product. I will just use internet tips on fasting along with my phone's alarms. I am so sick of these ad-riddled apps.",1
7211,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"App is too unpredictable. It was great in the beginning, but it started getting harder to get my tracking. Last week I figured out how to set my times so that they coincided with my schedule (I work overnights 3 days/week). When my fasting started for yesterday, it ended my fast 2 hours after I started, and then said I had been fasting since the 27th of last month. Plus, the ads are insane! I know they are a necessity, but they are really out of control. Deleting & starting a new app.",1
7212,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"When I first downloaded this app, I was satisfied, it was working as described. I decided to upgrade and try a premium version for a month and that was a mistake! I payed but nothing has changed! I am still using the regular version with adds popping up every time I open the app. I reached out to the customer service, but they have not replied at all! Thus, I doubt I am getting my money back. Overall, very disappointing experience. I would give it negative stars if that was an option.",1
7213,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I was using this app a few months ago and it was great but then it suddenly stopped retaining my entries.It would think I was fasting when I wasn't and vice versa. I finally uninstalled it. I tried it again at the beginning of this week, making sure that I hit ""save"" after ending/starting. Even after doublechecking that everything is ticking away ok- some days I wake up the next day and it has lost track.",1
7214,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I understand that ads are necessary for this to be a free app. however I would say the particular type of ads this app has are very annoying. Sometimes the ads have timers built in on them where you can't move your screen or exit or go back until the timer is over. The free version is essentially a timer and a body weight tracker. Because the ads are such a pain I now just use the timer on my phone.,1
7215,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Impossible to turn off without uninstalling. It started off being a great app with little ads, I had given 5 stars but recent update quadrupled ads and annoyances of placement with those full screen ads nobody likes. Fixed ads near bottom is smarter. I expect to push for pro version. Has a timer with tips and enjoyable but how hard is it really to know when you started. Plus app has no easy means to exit the app. Had to use Android settings function to force kill the running app.",1
7216,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Good lord, if you set up a fasting schedule it just automatically assumes you started fasting at that time, I doesn't wait for you to confirm. And it's also really UNintuitive to get to past fasts to edit your logs if you didn't devote yourself to a stupid app or borderline disordered eating to log when you started eating. I tend to log everything after I close my window. This app is impossible once you go premium. Just skip it",1
7217,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"6 MONTHS OF SUCCESSFULLY TRACKING DID NOT TRANFER TO MY NEW PHONE. I LOST ALL MY DATA. if you know how to retrieve the data, I would appreciate it.Edit: I appreciate the reply. The phone was traded in. I can't sync. The reason I neve ""synced"" before was because I had no Fitbit, Garmin etc... to sync to. If you can retrieve my data I would appreciate it. Also, the app worked better on the old pixel.

Tracking my water intake has helped me increase it. Thanks for that app. But tracking my fasting hours and eating hours is broken.

So I might not keep this app much longer. Had it about a 1 ¹/2 week.",1
7219,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"All these reviews say you can choose between a weekly plan or a daily plan and you can't. There's only daily fasting plans, which means every day you have to select the same plan and reset the fasting times and do it again. It's more work than it's worth. If there is a way to do a weekly plan, it's not readily apparent and there's no help function or option.",1
7220,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"** GARBAGE DEVELOPER COMMUNICATION ** Don't pay for the subscription. Still showing ads after paying for a year. No refund from Google as the 48 hours of purchase passed and no help from developers because they already have your money. Reached out numerous times to developers and no response. Uninstalled and reinstalled app which temporarily worked, but lost all my data!! Cancelled annual subscription. Waste of money as I still have ads WHEN I PAID FOR NO ADS!!",1
7221,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I took a leap of faith and paid for the year subscription and it is not enough bang for my buck. If you turn off the notification bar to save battery consumption (even if you leave push notifications on) it doesn't give you push notifications. So the two options are let it waste your battery from background running all day or make it completely ineffective. Complete waste of $20.,1
7222,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I thought this was going to be a great free app to track fasting. But it's not. I set my fasting period to start at 7pm and end at 9am the next day. But the app will not stop the counting of fasting automatically. So rather than it ending my fasting time I have to go in and change it. And if I forget to stop the clock I can't go back and edit the end time. It told me I was fasting for 24 hours and I wasn't. Poor user quality in my opinion.,1
7223,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"This was great now the free version is trash. Open the app and an ad plays that you cannot exit from, it just freezes.

It prevents me from seeing other notifications on my watch, and it wears the battery down really fast.",1

Obviously that is pretty irritating since I generally end the fast on the day I actually end it. Ads have absolutely gotten out of hand and are obnoxious. If it wasn't buggy and unusable right now, I'd pay for an adfree version. As it stands now I'm looking into other fasting apps. Please fix the glitch and I'll edit my review. Updated 3/16",1

I'm so irritated with the whole situation.,1
7229,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I paid for the $19.99 full year subscription in the last few days of Dec 2021. Now I am regretting it because for the last week or two the app does not remind me of anything. I went into settings and made sure that all notifications were turned on. I really wanted this app to work for me which is why I paid for the whole year. At this point I really want the support team of this app to make things right and issue me a refund.,1

To close the ad, you have to first close the video ad, and then close the image ad banner. Ads once in a while, for free version is fine. But this app has done an overkill of ads, to be honest. Tip: Reduce frequency of full page ads. Or move ads to a small portion of screen (like a banner)",1

So you are forced to watch the video. It takes me enormous willpower to fast. By forcing me to watch ads, you are killing my willpower. This is the reason for the 1-star rating.",1
7273,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Not worth the money. Bought the membership and it was a waste. There's no notifications tell you when to stop/start fasting and if you happen to not think to stop the timer it just keeps rolling and your records get all messed up and it says you're fasting during the eating period.

Hiding basic functionality behind a paywall won't get you more sales.",2
7404,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I have been using this app for a while now and I do like it.

It *sounds* like the app may still be in early development, so I'm willing to wait it out a bit. For anyone complaining they can't cancel, you manage that in GooglePlay, not the app itself.",2

Side note, when you put in your time when you start fasting, 9/10 it won't save! So, when you go to end fasting, it'll ask, ""Have you started fasting?"" I have a general idea of when I started fasting l, so I enter it in AGAIN. Very frustrating.",2
7407,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,It's a great app. I like how you can just log in your fasting time without sticking to their plan. I fast 18:6 but sometimes I don't get to eat till the 20th hour. Its allows me to be more flexible. The only thing I can't not stand in the app is the ADDS. Its horrible it will make you watch an add for like 1 min before you get to use the app. EVERYTIME YOU LOG IN you have to watch an add for 40+ seconds. No option to exit. It a great app but ADDS are the problem,2

So it records my fasting as 0 minutes. Also, when I choose to end fasting it ""aborts"" fasting instead of ""completes"" fasting and does not give me credit for those hours. It gets annoying having to remember 2 days later to try and fix what this app should do for you the first time. Please fix!",2
7411,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Can't sync with fitbit. Other than the extra tips and recipes I don't see where it's worth paying for this app. Especially since there are others that are free. People usually don't mind ads. The app is pretty plain and doesn't offer much for people to pay. Besides once you've read all the tips, there aren't more. It's like reading the same book or article over and over. Needs new content. Recipes don't change either. Can't log exercises or food. That would be worth it.",2
7412,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Cool app, but my issue is once a plan is started, the times can't be edited. Example: I started a 14-10 plan, but on one day I fasted longer than 14hrs. On another day, I started fasting earlier than scheduled.. in both cases, I was unable to adjust the times without aborting the whole plan. Update: I downloaded the app again, and just selected custom as the option and that kept me on track, but if I need to edit a time, I've noticed that the app won't let me edit time for the current day👎🏿",2

Im constantly getting ads and emails about other related items to purchase. I shouldnt have to pay again to not see ads. Also alot of people who fast do it along with keto so would be nice to have that as a diet plan UNCLUDED in this but if I want that I have to pay another monthly subscription. I can do everything this app provides on my own. Disappointed.",2
7414,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Liked the sticky notification with the clock, but the day planner and schedule was too rigid and hard to adapt as times fluctuated and needed to be adjusted if I fasted a little longer on some days. Found a different app that lets me adjust tasting times for each day more easily, and runs plans by the week, not inevitably, so can change things up as I need better. Good start, but needs some improvements.",2
7415,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Some nice features, but I had to watch 3 commercials just trying to figure out how to edit info I entered. I wasn't able to edit my info, which was very frustrating. I'm probably deleting this app. I want something simple to use that I don't need to mess around trying to figure it out and waiting for commercials in between. And they don't even offer a free trial of premium first. They could at least give a few days so we can see if we like it before committing financially. I'm not impressed,",2
7416,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"While I like the app, I had to set it so that it could not send notifications to my watch, as it send them EVERY SECOND! Yes, every second, my watch would vibrate. This is the only app that has a second timer/countdown and the only one that feels the need to share notifications CONSTANTLY. It's really quite annoying.",2
7417,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"So, I paid for the premium (one year) expecting to get more than just an ad-free experience, but did not. I thought I would be able to customize the hours of my fasting and be afforded to ""take days off"" within the app, but NOPE. I thought I could choose/learn about a 10-2 option... Whatever that is... No additional information was provided. Don't pay for the premium if you're expecting more features. There aren't any. Just no advertisements. I'm quite disappointed.",2
7418,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Not a bad app, even though the English in it is a bit wonky. That's not really that big of a deal, though. It gets 2 stars because the ads are SUPER annoying and the only way to get rid of them is to SUBSCRIBE...why do I have to subscribe? I don't want to pay MONTHLY for an app. If it were a simple few dollar purchase, I'd have done it in a heart beat. Instead, the developer chose to be greedy so they get nothing.",2
7419,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"After using this tracker, I have found that the advertising is intrusive and frustrating. It is difficult to get out of the advertisement loop to exit or move onto a different part of the program. I know that the"" free"" program has ads and I accept that in order to determine if the program itself is worth paying for. In this instance the ads have driven me away.",2
7420,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I just need it to continually time and give reminder notices. It keeps making me choose everyday what fasting schedule I want. Why can't I just choose it once and then change it when I want? After 3 days it stopped reminding to hydrate for some reason. I did not change any settings. I don't like that it makes you tell it when you stopped fasting. I never remembered to and had to manually enter it. When I set my eating period times, I assumed it would just go by that.",2
7421,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I paid for the premium subscription for this. I thought it would be pretty helpful and helping me maintain and even lose some weight. However, what I really found is that it drains my battery super fast. In addition to that, it doesn't really help me a whole lot. It's really basic information that you can find on any free source through Google. I think the subscription is rather expensive for what they offer you. In addition, the platform is not very intuitive, making it difficult to use.",2
7422,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"The idea of the app is helpful but it had caused major migraines for me that medicine and drs. Couldnt stop so for me spending the expensive amount for the app was a waste. The best part of the app was the water reminder. It even made customers, coworkers, and friends want water. I love the water reminder. Some of the plans layouts confused me a little but how the app works is very easy to navigate. Just dont buy until you know its safe for you. It wasnt safe for me so i am out $20 plus dr fees.",2
7423,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Try to use this app for the last two days and it keeps starting me over as though I haven't already put all my information in! I go to where it says 'start fasting', put in the time to start, enter it and it sets up as 'not fasting'. I had to set it up three times before it actually saved properly. Then later when I went back in, it asked me to pick a plan and put in the information to start fasting! Sorry guys very frustrating!",2
7424,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"It's okay. It's annoying getting the time adjusted. I'd rather not NEED to be on my phone to start and end fasting times.. a notification would work just fine. If you miss pressing start fir a day, it's like you're trying to steal a badge or something... I think the mark is missed on that achievement concept.. I literally sought a tracking app so I can TRACK my progress... the priority should be tracking and allowing it... the badges are fun, but of little imprtance to my fast",2
7425,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,On the fourth day the fasting tracker wrongly computed my fast. I tried correcting it and it would not reflect the correct fasting time. I deleted it and there's no way to add a fast to reflect the correct time for the day deleted. I don't need an inaccurate baby-sitter. I'm perfectly able to monitor time with a clock. The app is quite superfluous if it cannot reflect accurate data or have accurate data entered manually. I canceled my free trial. Deleting app.,2
7426,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"This app is nice and easy to use, however, the notification that it keeps up to let you know where you are in your fast, will trigger the notification ping on a smart watch repeatedly causing it to constantly alert you that there is a notification. After this week is over, I'm going to switch to another app because it renders my watch nearly useless.",2
7427,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Its alright. How can you expect someone to lose weight when you are showing ads for McDonald's?? Kinda stupid no?The point is to lose weight and focus on your goals not go download an app to eat fast food. It's called fasting app not fast food app. I like the water reminder though.I didn't get the premium cuz I'm not going pay for something I can look up on Google. I have a nutritionist so don't need it. Other than that, that's it.",2
7428,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"The app makes odd mistakes. On several occasions I've activated the start fasting button, closed the app, double checked it by restarting rebooting my phone etc and it says I'm fasting and when I check it next day, it will ask me if I've stated fasting yet. Just updated and will be uninstalling if this continues to happen as tracking fasting is the point of this app. Although I highly doubt it, I'm going to chalk it up to user error at this point to give the app the benefit of the doubt.",2
7429,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"it's glitchy after recent update. When you end your fast, you cannot adjust the time back if tou need to. It does not give you a ""today"" selection, which ruins your data and your stats. This didn't used to happen. I hope it's fixed soon or I'll have to find a different tracker app.",2
7430,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Normally I wait to make a review, because I like to be fair, but I can't wait. I've done IE before on my own, but I thought an app and tracker could be useful. To be fare, it's ok. What I can't stand is not being able to customize food options (I have allergies and restrictions), and I can't make any use of the articles) information available. It says tap right to see the next slide, but it's just an ad you exit out of and are stuck on the first page. How is that helpful?",2
7431,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Making more of the reading information available for free would be encouraging to any potential buyers of the premium features, instead of making it a paid feature of the app- especially when they can Google it for free. As an advanced faster, I can honestly admit, the information I researched (long before using your app) is what inspired my interest in fasting. But making it a premium feature to pay for may only discourage potential buyers' interest, thus convincing them to seek it elsewhere...",2
7432,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I had no problems with the app but after I didn't need it anymore I can't cancel it there's no way for me to cancel my subscription! I can't find no way to cancel my subscription I really need help with this can someone tell me how to go about it so my credit card doesn't keep getting charged! Thank you .... Other than that I truly loved the app and I did lose weight!,2
7433,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"When the fasting plan actually works the app is nice but I routinely have problems with it maintaining the proper fasting schedule. I have it set for 14-10 as I am new to the fasting scene. More often than not, however, I look to see where I am in terms of time remaining - be it eating or fasting, and I will see that I have been fasting for 17 hours. There are more shortcomings but Google is capping my character count so I have to end it here. I did subscribe but it definitely is not worth it.",2
7434,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I loved the app at first I've been using the custom fast option because I tend to do extended fasts. It worked perfectly at first but now it started to not allow me to end the fast today, it only allows me to end it yesterday so a 20+ hour fast turns into a 1, 2, or 0 hour fast. At first if I could hit save quickly enough it would record it but now immediately it says I started the fast yesterday at 3PM and I ended it yesterday at 1PM. How I can manage a negative 2 hour fast is a mystery!",2

You can use it if you're a man, but be prepared to be treated like you don't exist or that somehow intermittent fasting isn't for men. All the articles, graphics, guides, ets. only portray women. This is ironic, since intermittent fasting works especially well for men, while it can be difficult and problematic for women due to differences in physiology. Why make this such a female-centric app and alienate half of your audience? Dumb.",2
7436,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"This app has huge potential. I have to find anther fasting app because this one gets difficult to edit my start and to fasting times. The process is confusing somewhat. If you skip a day, you can't go back and add you fasting times. It's also confusing to know what day you're setting the dating time. The app will ask if you started dating. When you click yes, you thinking you clicking for the present day. Somehow my fat is showing as if I've been fasting for multiple days. Confusing...",2
7437,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Has advertising AND requires a $3/mo premium subscription to access the most common/popular non-human coaching plans. I shouldn't have to see ads *AND* pay to use features. Either you give me the full app with ads, or let me pay to remove the ads. You don't get both. The advertising tends to be annoying and inappropriate content. (Drug use, clickbait) and relatively intrusive compared to most in app advertising. I will say it seems otherwise well designed and has some nice functions, but the negatives above ruin it.",2
7438,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Tricked into paying to remove ads, but the pro functions are still locked and require additional payment (which would likely also have removed ads). The price I paid to remove ads seemed reasonable for a subscription, so I didn't give it a lot of thought since it used to just be one payment to unlock everything. Having to fork over another £20 or so a year just to have the pro features seems very scammy. Not happy.",2

Having said the above, I did use this for about 3 months but I'm deleting it tonight as the ads have become too onerous. Some of the most recent ones, there is no way to shut them down and they just keep going and going. You have to shut the app down and restart it and hope you get one you can exit out of.

7442,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Way too many adds. It's a nice app but if I have to wait 40 seconds and watch an add to see where I'm at in my fast - not worth it.,2
7443,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,It was a great app up until a few days ago. Now it's nothing but a bunch of pop up advertisements. Will be deleting this app after I finish my fast. Disappointed,2

7445,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Why sometimes do I have to stop the fasting and others it just continues automatically? I have been doing the 16:8 fasting but there has been a couple of time when I realised hours later I was eating bit the app said I was fasting.,2
7446,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Ads are excessive, and things it advertises, like the body status are no where to be found.",2
7447,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Money hungry app. Way too many ads, and takes forever to open. Note for the owners, do you really need to have ads when you have so many subscribers. Make the UI experience the best and see what will happen.",2

I'm not opposed to paying for some services, however there are several apps and I want to find my fit. Specifically, I am unable to edit my fasting end time or the calendar fasting days. I like that you have a timer for fasting and eating and the water intake but I think there are too few free services to make me want to purchase.",2
7449,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I've been using premium feature (which was quite expensive for no new features added throughout the year) I decided on not renewing premium but paying to remove ads. That was a great idea because I mostly do 8-16 plans anyway. My issue currently is about notification. The beautiful colorful notification bar is gone in the last Android update. And it doesn't open by itself like it used to when I restart my phone. This is really a user experience bummer. Will update score once resolved.,2
7450,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I'm reviewing the paid version. After giving my stats and choosing my plan, I was expecting a little more interaction from this app. Like recommending how many calories or giving tips or encouragement via notifications throughout the day? Nothing. This is very, very basic. If you want to know what it's doing, you've got to go looking, and it isn't doing much. Stick with free version.",2
7451,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"So far so good. Just downloaded the app and everything is great. Love the extra tips and info regarding your body during fasting.... I'll update after a week of use. Updated: It erases the hours of fasting, so if you don't remember at what time you had dinner, the next day you'll have to calculate the time yourself and update the track. Its kind of useless for me. Healthy tips aside, the main purpose of the app is to keep track for you and it doesn't unless you use one of the plans.",2
7452,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,At first I was happy to pay for this app (even though I don't think it's really worth it) because I liked the constant reminder of which phase I'm in. I set up a 5-2 plan and the first week was fine. Into week two my plan said my fasting day was Tuesday but the notification said I was in an eating period. When I checked the app there was no plan. I haven't cancelled it or anything so not sure where it went. The functionality is very basic and doesn't really work so I deleted it.,2
7453,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,This app does not gently increase the level of fasting for beginners. There's no proper guidance. So I over did it and came to an abrupt stop in fasting. The overall effect was to gain weight. Also it doesn't warn people with gastritis of its effects and on how to counter the effects of heart burn. The app is beautifully done and its notifications and interface is very good. The app also does motivation for fasting.,2
7454,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Compared to some other subscription based fasting apps, I appecheate how you can just choose to pay to remove ads & subscription is more reasonably priced. Subscription is really over pushed in app tho. Also, there is only a water tracking widget - fasting based widget would be more useful. Also, the ""creating your personalized plan"" loading screen is totally faked which is pretty scummy. Honestly, there are lighter apps out there that would better suit the average users needs.",2
7455,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,This don't give me any update or notifications when to start or stop eating when I close the app. Therefore it's not really useful,2
7456,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"The ads are EXTREMELY disruptive when entering information, to the point that after installing this a mo th ago I've stopped using the app. It's very basic unless you want to pay. It'd be more helpful to include the option to enter completed exercise with estimated caloric burn as well as the option to enter meals and calories consumed. Neither of these options exist. If you are new to IF this app might be helpful, but it is so lacking you will get bored of it quickly.",2
7457,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,EDIT: Afs have gotten very annoying. Also it seems you can't chabg3e the start and end time any longer. Shame! Nice and easy app to use. Adds are not too annoying. And the water drinking reminder is very good. If there was an option to see the time remaining instead of only the time since we are fasting or eating I would give 5 stars.,2
7458,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Need to restart my selected plan each day. Instead of continuing the timer with non fasting stage. It asks if I stop fasting. After that I need to select again a plan anew. No notification is triggered that I entered non fasting stage. That would be nice. Big minus are commercials which automatically increase volume from zero. Never seen that and don't approve!,2
7459,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"So I got a notification to start fasting, did so without noting the time as I assumed that the app had done this since it had notified me but then the next day found the app had not recorded the start time and I had to manually input the time which I did not know. Would be good if when the notification pops up app asks you ""have you started fasting?"" and allows you to input time there and then to record it. Thanks for the app, great idea and hope this feedback helps!",2
7460,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"App is ok. it's a little bit bloated with useless clatter. Also, there is no option for no weight loss. It forces you to pick up some goals, and there is no way around. The widget of this app is a complete waste of time, had no use, no sense, and it is bizarre. Shame. I wouldn't advice to pay for the premium version.",2
7461,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Great App, but enough with all the ads! After Every action is an Ad, just plain greed. Very frustrating.",2
7462,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Great app but I'm trying to cancel my subscription and I'm still getting charged!! I can't find end subscription option in settings please help,2
7463,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Used to think that it was pretty but the excess commercials which caused an extremely long load time finally pegged my BS meter. Was a 5-star hit me. Now more like a 2.5, but since I can't do half points, 2 works for. Would probably be different if I paid for it but sorry. That ship has sailed.",2
7464,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"It's a nice app, but the pop-up video commercials take too long and is annoying. I understand it's a free version and hence the advertisements. But, If you're going to include a pop-up ad, doing it to inform by keeping the ad simple graphic ad and quick is probably more effective than a longer video ad.",2
7465,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"The application is simple, it works, however I keep experiencing this super annoying bug where once a commercial starts, the music continues to play until I restart my phone. Nothing else works. Even when the add is over and I minimize or close the app. I'll need to switch to another app because of this ;(",2
7466,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,You have to constantly reset customized plans. It's a hassle and really not worth the price.,2
7467,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"It's the a best app for fasting. Only has 5sec ads so it's alright. Although since the update, the notification alert became boring like the others. Please bring back the old one. It's unique and colorful and it's hard to miss so you will see it first and it will remind you that you're still fasting or need to drink water. I wish I didn't update it. BRING BACK THE RECENT NOTIFICATION ALERT DESIGN.",2
7468,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I used this app with a lot of success for about 5 months before it stopped working. The widget now closes intermittently, and the app won't send me notifications for when to start or stop eating. It's a shame because this app really is great for tracking eating/fasting periods. Hopefully it will be fixed in the future!",2
7469,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I was expecting this Fasting App would remind me the time to eat / stop eating. However, somehow it just doesn't work as I thought. If you developers can't make notification appear at the time users set, why do you bother to develop this app anyway? (Moreover, if a user doesn't want the notification bar to show and he / she won't get any notification at all!)",2
7470,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I paid for the premium but found it difficult to keep track. Once you have a plan in place you can't flex it day to day easily so I ended up ignoring it and not keeping data. Ended up going back to the free Fastic app where I could just push a button to start and end fasts.,2
7471,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Okay, so, there's absolutely no need at all to get premium. It's a farce. It unlocks 10 mediocre recipes and some extremely shallow ""information"". This information barely scratches the surface. You'll learn nothing. You're better off googling stuff. It's a joke. One star for the fasting timer, at least that works as you'd expect from a timer. Edit: they added some more recipes, in my opinion, that's a step in the right direction. +1 Star",2
7472,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I'd give 3.5 to 4 stars, but I'm 5 days in and the app just reset itself. Only change is I paid for no ads. Just 5 days, but that's pretty disappointing. Two days in a row now. I'm about to request a refund on what I've payed as it wasn't doing this for the first few days. Really frustrating as, this would be the ideal app for fasting.",2
7473,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Not convenient enough. Having to manually input when I start and stop fasting is not convenient. If I get confused, then I get discouraged to keep going. Bodyfast is the app I prefer, since it sends me a notification 1 hour before my fasting time, then another at the start and another telling me to begin eating. Really feels like a coach rather than a tool.",2
7474,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Has a glitch with the notification bar that makes it disappear all the time and also notifications don't get sent, like reminders and such. I've troubleshoot the issue, but I can't fix it. That's such a a pain when you've paid for a whole years subscription. Hate to say I'll be uninstalling.",2
7475,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Great to start with. It doesn't remember every time I enter for fasting though. I have to keep screen shots of my start and stop times so I can reenter them the next day or week. It can be very frustrating!,2
7476,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Overall good app. I subscribed although fasting just isn't for me and so I tried to contact customer service to cancel my subscription and I can't seem to get in touch with them no matter what I do or who I contact. I haven't been using the app and I'm still being charged $5 a month for nothing.,2
7477,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Had to remove a few stars. Can't get past the ad to get into the fasting app. It's in another language. I have everything set to English, not sure what's going on. Since I can't use the app, it goes from 5 stars down to 2.",2
7478,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"This app has been awesome right up until today. I forgot to end the fast and 10 minutes later when I went to edit it, it would not allow me to. In the process of trying to figure it out it ended up deleting the entire fast. Now my streak is broken and there is no way to enter data. Very frustrated. Before this the app was helping me a great deal to stay on track and I regularly recommended it to others.",2
7479,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I love this app. I wish I had found sooner. Update.. CHECK YOUR ACCOUNTS FOR UNAUTHORIZED CHARGES. October 30 My PayPal account was charged over $10 for this app via Click bank and also my Google pay account was charged for an upgrade and has totaled $6.02 I didn't authorize an upgrade. I never give anyone my permission to charge my accounts. I'm attempting to contact someone from this app but all I can find is an email address. I sent an email but would like to speak to someone about this.,2
7480,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"The fasting timer is not consistent at all with how you set it so instead of using data, you're really better off setting your own time frames and sticking to them. The fasting concept itself is easily followed if disciplined enough to do so. I only find the stress, heart rate and sleep monitoring slightly helpful with the app but I'm sure there's more accurate apps to use for those. I've been at it about 4 weeks and had to restart the app about 3 or 4 times also. Deleting.",2
7481,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"It's great for fasting but when I first used it in June 2020, I could track my food intake as well. That seems to have disappeared with the update and in its place, ads. Way more functional for me through the summer than now. I would love to be able to calculate my meals again- bring that back.",2
7482,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I would give it more stars if it let's me add previous fasting times or import data from other fasting app. I was hoping to get out of my old fasting app and use this one, but it seems almost impossible. This app also seems little complicated and lack the integration of physical activity to the daily progress. I would be happy to give five stars if I could at least add my precious records",2
7483,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"This app has some nice features but overall I'm not loving. I did buy the premium version for one month to try it out and after one day I knew I needed something different. Some graphics aren't very helpful or they're actually inaccurate. In the premium version I'm asked what time I usually eat breakfast, lunch, or dinner. After putting the data in I'd expect when I chose a given fasting plan, say a 20-4 plan, the app would remind me at my usual lunch time (1:00 p.m.), but it starts at 12:00 and eating time is for 2 hours, not 4. Glad I didn't sign up for the 6 month plan.",2
7484,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,It's a very basic app. I can't edit the end fast time until the day has passed and that's really annoying. My schedule moves around and I don't have an exact set time to eat. There needs to be more ability to. personally control the times on a day by day basis.,2
7485,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"The UI is well laid out and slick. However, i think the app does just too little to justify paid subscription. There are just a few recipies included. Basically it just tracks the times when you start/stop eating. Does not track food/nutrient intake.",2
7486,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Waaaaay too many ads for an app which can count hours. I have a brain and a clock, I can do it myself without having to look at noise between every screen change. Mildly convenient. Adding 500 ads doesn't make me want to buy premium, it makes me want to uninstall the app. Good luck",2
7487,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Part of the recommendations in the app is to avoid high intensity exercise while fasting. I disagree with that recommendation. Just the opposite. If you are fasting from 8 or 9pm to 10 or 11AM, a 5am or 6am workout with no food will kick your metabolism into overdrive. Also, you will meet your hydration goals during this time. All difficult... But if you can do it your results will accelerate. Also, this app seems only tailored for women. This is a mistake.",2
7488,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"3$ seems steep to remove ads from this heavily added app. I would happily pay for it if the app had the functionality I wanted, which is a trimmed down version of this. Rather than starting over a fast each day I wish I could just have it repeat the same 16-8 cycle. Design of the app isn't bad, a little too bloated for what it is tho, timer kept in the notification bar is just plain ugly.",2
7489,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"This app does what it says, there is a timer and other helpful tools to aid you with fasting. But this app also seems to encourage disordered methods, like 3 day fasts, which are dangerous for some people. There is a lot of information that seems to be dressed as positive, such as your immune system being at risk after a 3 day fast, but this app tries to veil this as a good thing? No. It isn't. This app gives me an icky feeling and there should be more warnings on the health effects too.",2
7490,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Busy UI, had to hunt for the buttons. very clearly in the free band (constant reminders), prices for the paid version are super steep. I found a more straightforward app that does the same thing for free (or a reasonable fee to get rid of the ads)",2
7491,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Had given this app a 5. Then decided to buy the premium. Nothing. No changes from what was already on my phone. I had it for about 1 hour. I emailed the makers of the app. Instead of answering my questions I just got an email back ""no refunds""! I cancelled the charge but apparently I will have it for a month. Really crappy customer service. Still like the app itself but crappy service 😞",2
7492,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,It was working great for a while (a good 8 month) until recently (loan) ads would come on and I wouldn't be able to exit out or have an option to click on exit. I've tried to force to shut it down but even thay doesnt work. I may have to find another app if this continues.,2
7493,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Had for a week or so. Some of the instructions are contradictory. ""You are fasting - start fasting now"". Setting up a week to follow on from the next or just have a rolling program seems to be difficult. There is a countdown clock for the eating period, which makes me want to binge. I think it should be a count up during the eating period. Just not as slick as I'd hoped for a paid app. I didn't realise there was a free version so feel a bit duped now.",2
7494,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I've used this app for years and love it, but recently, ads have been implemented, and despite uninstalling and reinstalling the app, the ads won't close. The ""x"" button doesn't work, and every time you open the app, an ad comes up. I can't even use it anymore.",2
7495,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Awful - I paid for a year's subscription back in January and in June swapped phones from and Apple to Android. The app didn't work so I contacted the team who told me that the developers hadn't yet made the app work between the two iOS to Android. They wouldn't refund the difference and said contact apple. Apple said that the purchase was made too long ago so they couldn't refund me either. So instead of renewing annually I've moved to Zero fasting app. Much better and better customer service.,2
7496,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"not bad for a free app! update: december 25,2023 too much ads, like i closed the app midway the ads, relaunched 2x, and it would still play long ads. sorry, i think you guys were great at first.. if only positive feedback could pay the bills, huh? AGAIN, TOO MANY ADS",2

That's the entire purpose of the app so it's not great that it's hard to find the start/stop fast button. Have an extra star for ads and subscription stuff being discrete.",2
7501,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Not bad,2
7502,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"All this is really, is a timer and water intake counter. You can do that on your phone. Having said the above, I did use this for about 3 months but I'm deleting it tonight as the ads have become too onerous. Some of the most recent ones, there is no way to shut them down and they just keep going and going. You have to shut the app down and restart it and hope you get one you can exit out of. I got 2 bad ones in a row tonight. 2 the Devs - greed kills. No thanks. I'm done. Deleting. Good bye.",2
7503,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Ads are excessive, and things it advertises, like the body status are no where to be found.",2
7504,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"This have non veg plan, I want vegitarian.",2
7505,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"It's a decent app if you pay for the subscription. Feels like it's made for kids, though, as every day you finish you get a million ""badges"". I just wanted a simple fasting timer.",2
7506,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"This app really helps me but I'm so confused..?? I put my dinner lunch and breakfast times on the thingy and I started a new fast and its telling me I can't eat till tomorrow? (It's like 12 right now and it's telling me to eat tomorrow at 1 for dinner??) I am just so confused on how the app works D: and I'm also confused on when breaking a fast I pressed ""eating time"" or whatever and it puts a timer?? Idk I'm confused",2
7507,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I've had this app for about 3 years. I used to love it. But now the ads are absolutely obnoxious, and $4.99 a month is highway robbery for what it does! Please don't get greedy! With 10+ mil subscribers, 🤷‍♀️😠... I pay WAY LESS than that a year for my food / exercise / macros tracker that includes a bit of a fasting function. The good thing is they don't sell your info to 3rd parties, and you can delete your info. I used to think 5 stars for this app.",2
7508,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Way too many adds. It's a nice app but if I have to wait 40 seconds and watch an add to see where I'm at in my fast - not worth it.,2
7509,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Antes era mejor, ahora su publicidad es molesta.",2
7510,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Too many adds,2
7511,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Tricked into paying to remove ads, but the pro functions are still locked and require additional payment (which would likely also have removed ads). The price I paid to remove ads seemed reasonable for a subscription, so I didn't give it a lot of thought since it used to just be one payment to unlock everything. Having to fork over another £20 or so a year just to have the pro features seems very scammy. Not happy.",2
7512,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"not bad for a free app! update: december 25,2023 too much ads, like i closed the app midway the ads, relaunched 2x, and it would still play long ads. sorry, i think you guys were great at first.. if only positive feedback could pay the bills, huh? AGAIN, TOO MANY ADS",2
7513,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Used to be good until now. I have to endure a full minute of advertisement to open the app. Now it is uninstalled, thank you very much.",2
7514,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Why sometimes do I have to stop the fasting and others it just continues automatically? I have been doing the 16:8 fasting but there has been a couple of time when I realised hours later I was eating bit the app said I was fasting.,2
7515,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Right now there's way too many ads. As an app for fasting it's pretty good, but the ads are just way too much for me. Unskippable 15-30+ second ads every time you open up the app and sometimes when you press the end/start fasting button. 5 stars without those ad problems. But right now, nah.",2
7516,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Money hungry app. Way too many ads, and takes forever to open. Note for the owners, do you really need to have ads when you have so many subscribers. Make the UI experience the best and see what will happen.",2
7517,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,This don't give me any update or notifications when to start or stop eating when I close the app. Therefore it's not really useful,2
7518,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Used to think that it was pretty but the excess commercials which caused an extremely long load time finally pegged my BS meter. Was a 5-star hit me. Now more like a 2.5, but since I can't do half points, 2 works for. Would probably be different if I paid for it but sorry. That ship has sailed.",2
7519,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,It was a great app up until a few days ago. Now it's nothing but a bunch of pop up advertisements. Will be deleting this app after I finish my fast. Disappointed,2
7520,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Boh,2
7521,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,You have to constantly reset customized plans. It's a hassle and really not worth the price.,2
7522,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"It's okay. Paid for full version and lots of repetitive information in different areas. I don't mind the short videos but I feel like you should be able to pause it without having to hold the screen to pause it. If I am trying to get a recipe and whatnot, my hand is in the way of reading it because that's how I am supposed to pause it and it's in the way. No area to keep track of eating. Feel like it was a waste of money for full version. Not worth it. Only used for 3 days so far. Maybe 4.",2
7523,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Great App, but enough with all the ads! After Every action is an Ad, just plain greed. Very frustrating.",2
7524,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Great app but I'm trying to cancel my subscription and I'm still getting charged!! I can't find end subscription option in settings please help,2
7525,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"At the bare minimum, a fasting app should track your actual eating and try to push you towards your target. If you want to charge extra for added features, fine. But this app gives you only two trivial plans in the free version. It's useless to me and won't help new fasters progress. Hiding basic functionality behind a paywall won't get you more sales.",2
7526,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Had to remove a few stars. Can't get past the ad to get into the fasting app. It's in another language. I have everything set to English, not sure what's going on. Since I can't use the app, it goes from 5 stars down to 2.",2
7527,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Not comparable to FASTIC, which is way better and at a lower cost.",2
7528,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I building a custom fasting regime for a week is not possible,2
7529,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,So I paid for the Premium on July 14 and on I got my phone stolen 2 months ago and now got another phone but it claim that I don't have a premium account after re-downloading. Sent various messages with the email but I wasn't given any response,2
7530,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Overall good app. I subscribed although fasting just isn't for me and so I tried to contact customer service to cancel my subscription and I can't seem to get in touch with them no matter what I do or who I contact. I haven't been using the app and I'm still being charged $5 a month for nothing.,2
7531,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,All they want you to do is buy plans,2
7532,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Too many ads,2
7533,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Confusing. It says I'm +6 hours beyond the schedule but the expected time says I still have 5 more hours left.,2
7534,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Much less helpful than other apps I've tried.,2
7535,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"App is ok. it's a little bit bloated with useless clatter. Also, there is no option for no weight loss. It forces you to pick up some goals, and there is no way around. The widget of this app is a complete waste of time, had no use, no sense, and it is bizarre. Shame. I wouldn't advice to pay for the premium version.",2
7536,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Great to start with. It doesn't remember every time I enter for fasting though. I have to keep screen shots of my start and stop times so I can reenter them the next day or week. It can be very frustrating!,2
7537,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Odd It seems that you start with your fasting rather than waking up and starting a meal? Unable to access time for when your meal is to start....?? WT??,2
7538,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Unnecessary app,2
7539,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Inneficace,2
7540,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Good app but everytime you open app you're presented with ads first.,2
7541,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Paywall. It was free a long time ago. Unfortunately I have to find another app,2
7542,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,having to skip am ad every time I open the app? no thanks. also notifications don't work if the notifications bar is not enabled.,2
7543,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Pogisigena,2
7544,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"The worst part is that plans in this travker count hours i fast per day, not consecutive hours! So if i start fasting at 20:00 on Monday and finish at 11:00 next day, it will count 4 hours for Monday and 11 hours for Tuesday. The main idea of fasting is how many CONSECUTIVE hours i don't eat. Not how many hours i don't eat per day!!",2
7545,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I can put a timer on my clock app, would be as good as this app. The topics and answers you can find with a simple YouTube or Google search are somehow premium features and require payment. Do you think I've been living under a rock or something?",2
7546,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Downloaded onto a new device, all data got reset, and now it doesn't track any achievements which is really disappointing especially because I'm paying for this app :/",2
7547,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Too many ads. Go from one menu to another there's an ad. Minimize app, go back and that's another ad. Had it show an ad while editing time",2
7548,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I want to cancel premium cause is not worth it , but I cannot find how!!!",2
7549,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,It was so good,2
7550,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"The app is nice, but I'm not sure premium is worth it since almost all good recipes use imperial measurements instead of metric. Or there's a combination of the two ""add x milliliters of oil and y oz of chicken"" The app needs an option to display them in your preferred system, otherwise it's pointless and not worth the money.",2
7551,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I am not,2
7552,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Awful - I paid for a year's subscription back in January and in June swapped phones from and Apple to Android. The app didn't work so I contacted the team who told me that the developers hadn't yet made the app work between the two iOS to Android. They wouldn't refund the difference and said contact apple. Apple said that the purchase was made too long ago so they couldn't refund me either. So instead of renewing annually I've moved to Zero fasting app. Much better and better customer service.,2
7553,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Tired of it forgetting. I'm very OCD about entering info in apps like this and randomly, it will forget and tell me that I've been fasting for 2 days. The notification icon randomly disappears too. Potentially a good app, but I give up.",2
7554,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,How do I cancel the monthly subscription? I don't find it useful at this time for me.,2
7555,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,App is great but I synced my data when I switched phones and none of my badges or accomplishments transferred over. I've tried contacting the app through 4 emails now with no response. They need to figure out a system where at least someone will reply to you.,2
7556,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Had for a week or so. Some of the instructions are contradictory. ""You are fasting - start fasting now"". Setting up a week to follow on from the next or just have a rolling program seems to be difficult. There is a countdown clock for the eating period, which makes me want to binge. I think it should be a count up during the eating period. Just not as slick as I'd hoped for a paid app. I didn't realise there was a free version so feel a bit duped now.",2
7557,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I subscribed but still see ads and asking me to pay premium. Also the one day it did work it reset the next.,2
7558,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Not at all helpful in my opinion. All I want from a fasting app is to set the times I do fasting and to count hours for me could not even do this without going to set up the fasting hours everytime,2

7564,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Not good .In insights mostly non vegetarian food varieties there .no replacement for vegetarian food.app is also not worthable if you go for a premium.,2
7565,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Suddenly there are lots of ads without possibility to close [x] every time you want to update your weight or check something. In the beginning there wasnt as much ads.,2

7567,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Don't like that you cannot add fasting periods when on 16:8 when you want to stick to this schedule during the week but not so strict on weekends. Will delete after the one-month subscription,2
7568,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,It tells me to fast all day and eat when I am supposed to sleep? 12 AM to 10 AM?,2

Kinda stupid no?The point is to lose weight and focus on your goals not go download an app to eat fast food.

I have a nutritionist so don't need it. Other than that, that's it.",2
7571,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,The app is not worth all the nonstop barrage of ads. And it's not worth paying for. It's just a glorified timer. I'm ready to Uninstall it.,2

I have it set for 14-10 as I am new to the fasting scene. More often than not, however, I look to see where I am in terms of time remaining - be it eating or fasting, and I will see that I have been fasting for 17 hours. There are more shortcomings but Google is capping my character count so I have to end it here. I did subscribe but it definitely is not worth it.",2

7583,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Annoying ads. You want from me just to purchase your app!,2
7584,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Way too many ads,2
7585,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Compared to some other subscription based fasting apps, I appecheate how you can just choose to pay to remove ads & subscription is more reasonably priced. Subscription is really over pushed in app tho. Also, there is only a water tracking widget - fasting based widget would be more useful. Also, the ""creating your personalized plan"" loading screen is totally faked which is pretty scummy. Honestly, there are lighter apps out there that would better suit the average users needs.",2
7586,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"After using it for over a month, the app is clunky and I continue to have to reinitiate the program I'm using. I'm assuming this has to do with me not purchasing the service, but the lack of consistency doesn't endear me to buy a subscription.",2
7587,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,It does not notify you when the fasting time is over it just keep counting the time,2
7588,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"It's a nice app, but the pop-up video commercials take too long and is annoying. I understand it's a free version and hence the advertisements. But, If you're going to include a pop-up ad, doing it to inform by keeping the ad simple graphic ad and quick is probably more effective than a longer video ad.",2
7589,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I wish I had the notification on all the time, but not they disappeared, even though I have the paid version.",2
7590,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I've used this app before and it works okay but it doesn't have options for intersex people so I stopped using it because I am biologically intersex and their advice doesn't work for my hormone balance.,2
7591,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I'm reviewing the paid version. After giving my stats and choosing my plan, I was expecting a little more interaction from this app. Like recommending how many calories or giving tips or encouragement via notifications throughout the day? Nothing. This is very, very basic. If you want to know what it's doing, you've got to go looking, and it isn't doing much. Stick with free version.",2
7592,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Too many ads-ads lock up screen. Ads continually pop up to the point that screen is disabled. UPDATE: Thanks for your reply. I have enjoyed the App otherwise, and will definitely give it another chance.",2
7593,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Bro I downloaded this app to fast and it just gave me a fricking food advertisement 🫣,2
7594,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,It's a great app. I like how you can just log in your fasting time without sticking to their plan. I fast 18:6 but sometimes I don't get to eat till the 20th hour. Its allows me to be more flexible. The only thing I can't not stand in the app is the ADDS. Its horrible it will make you watch an add for like 1 min before you get to use the app. EVERYTIME YOU LOG IN you have to watch an add for 40+ seconds. No option to exit. It a great app but ADDS are the problem,2
7595,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Some nice features, but I had to watch 3 commercials just trying to figure out how to edit info I entered. I wasn't able to edit my info, which was very frustrating. I'm probably deleting this app. I want something simple to use that I don't need to mess around trying to figure it out and waiting for commercials in between. And they don't even offer a free trial of premium first. They could at least give a few days so we can see if we like it before committing financially. I'm not impressed,",2
7596,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,The ads were relentless and made using the app a frustrating experience.,2
7597,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"It's the a best app for fasting. Only has 5sec ads so it's alright. Although since the update, the notification alert became boring like the others. Please bring back the old one. It's unique and colorful and it's hard to miss so you will see it first and it will remind you that you're still fasting or need to drink water. I wish I didn't update it. BRING BACK THE RECENT NOTIFICATION ALERT DESIGN.",2
7598,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Started out well...now it's all Ads...right in the middle of me using the app...and they have no close button.,2
7599,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I am a subscriber of the app. The app do not have nutrutional provision for vegetarians. 😅. Else love the app. If this issue is solved than i assure a 5star feedback and 5 reference,2
7600,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Still waiting for subscription. Paid for a year membership. I'm not activated. I cannot use any of the prime functions. I've emailed each of their support emails. Still no response. Still can't tell if I want to reactivate reoccurring subscription. Basic functions though are awesome. Hate those ads. Can't even pay subscription to get rid of them.,3
7601,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I subscribed for one month to try this app and determine if it suits my needs. Overall, I'm quite satisfied with its features and performance. However, the customer service experience has left me hesitant about committing to the yearly plan. I've sent two emails inquiring about a specific function mentioned in the description (the ability to skip one day in the 16-8 plan), but I haven't received any feedback or assistance. If the customer service improves, this app could be the best.",3
7602,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Loved it when I first started. Makes keeping track of fasting and eating periods easy. Also nice to know exactly what each stage is doing for my body. Positive initial impression prompted me to subscribe to premium features. After a few weeks of premium features showing as extra menu options in app, now they, and their tabs, have disappeared. All I see when I go to my premium now is basically an ad that tells me what I'll get with premium, but none of the features are showing! Frustrating!!!",3
7603,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,This app has good information about intermittent fasting. I do like the options of how to set your fasting and the reminders are good. But what I would like are options to edit your schedule. I can't figure out how to do that without exciting and starting all over. Also my doctor recommended that I don't do this daily but to start with 3 days a week. There are no options to set that. It feels restrictive and really unhelpful. It is also a drain on my battery. Going to uninstall.,3
7604,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Very good app for recording and keeping track of your fast, but the ads are so obnoxious. Edit: I understand you need ads to stay free, but it's still annoying to insert 1 minute *unskipable* ads when I just want to record my progress, and when I do there's another ad immediately. Still, your app is good, just really held back by frequency of the frequncy of advertisements.",3
7605,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I wish there was an easier way to just tap ""begin fast"" and ""break fast"". I can't figure out how to do it and the timer for eating hours starts automatically on when my ""breakfast"" time is. Also when I first started it had me begin by putting my mood and I can adjust actual times there but never again. I pushed an additional 3 hours and can't even track it. Otherwise I would love this",3
7606,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"The good: works without an account or network access. The bad: The UI isn't the most intuitive. You have to hunt around for the start/stop fast buttons. The notifications override the standard Android background colours and are quite jarring. Fit sync kept pushing old data into my Fit account, so I had to disable it. It needs a read-only option.",3
7607,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Esentially, this tells you when to eat and when not to eat according to whatever ""plan"" you choose to follow. There are a few extra bells and whistles that make it nice, but it lacks some editing control that would bump it up another star or two. For instance, you can adjust the start time for fasting on any given day, but you can't adjust the STOP time. So if you're an overachiever, you'll get no credit or fancy award from the system if you extend your fast from 16 to 20 hours. :-\",3
7608,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"This is a nice, useful app that will provide you everything you need to get started and continue IF. I have a couple problems with the interface. First, I accidentally deleted my first day of fasting due to the clunky directions. That can be pretty discouraging for a new IFer. And speaking of clunky, if you're tracking water intake, the app makes it a chore to add ounces compared to other apps. Try it and you'll see. I wonder if the developers performed user testing and studied the use cases.",3
7609,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I really like the app, the only downside is once in awhile my account thinks I haven't paid for Premium, when in fact I have paid the yearly price for Premium access, but I will receive ads and not all the features. Sometimes just uninstalling and reinstalling works, but the amount of times I have to do that varies from a few times to 10+ times. This random event of the app thinking I don't have premium has happened to me about 5 or 6 times since I bought Premium, and it's really annoying.",3
7610,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"It's pretty good with a few drawbacks. First the good: It explains the fasting process and shows you where you are in the different stages. Now the bad: It keeps asking me to start my plan. I selected it and I expect it to keep that as the default, unless I go in and change it. Instead, I have to select a time and a plan for every fast. Maybe I'm just missing something here in which case it's not intuitive nor does it explain how to set that up.",3

If I could make a one-time payment to go ad-free I would, but there is no way I am paying a subscription just to remove ads on a glorified timer and counter app. As I am not currently interested in bonus features, there is no reason to go paid. Maybe the developer will add a tiered premium model, but until then imma pass.",3
7613,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Everything about this app is great and easy to use except the timer for ending a fast. I thought it would automatically end my fast in the window of time I set. Instead it requires you manually click when you stop fasting, and it won't let you set a past time. I.E. end fast at 6 but don't get to my phone until 8. Will only let me set current time. So if I forget, it logs my fasting did time incorrectly. Uninstalling.",3

I know that irl it doesn't make a difference but it's demoralizing to have that gap on my record that I can't seem to fix (the entries just go from the 25th to the 27th so I can't even go back and adjust it.) If reliable daily fast tracking is important to your motivation I'd recommend you look elsewhere",3
7615,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"This app is pretty basic. It does what it says and not much else. Two things I don't like: 1-thebplans only last for a week so each week you have to remember to go in and restart it, or you can manually enter it each day but that's taking the time and remembering to do it. The other thing is the water tracker. It is a great feature with the reminder, but there are odd options (1, 3, 6 oz) so if you have a large bottle that doesn't fit in one of their categories you have to click multiple things",3
7616,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Very similar to what every other fasting app is doing but they take up a slight notch with the visual stages of the fast. When you first load the app it's misleading in that you select your ideal weight and they formulate a plan for the weight loss and a date you'll achieve that. Before you see the plan they suggest you sign up for a paid subscription, so I did. But then there's no plan. You just choose how long of a fasting window you want. I reached out to the developer and no reply. 3/5",3
7617,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I just downloaded this bc I have nothing better to do and I've used other fasting apps. This one seemed most promising bc of the rating and how many downloads. I'm warning you now there is literally an ad every time after you do something (like going back to the main page from the settings) it is genuinely annoying. I shouldn't have to pay to get rid of them.,3
7618,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I really liked the app, it was useful for tracking my fasting & water intake. The only reason I'm rating it so low is because of the crappy ads. When first starting the app, I get intrusively long ads that I can't exit out of. I sat through a 60 second ad & could not find a way to close it so I could continue with the tracker app. Restarting the app just made the ad start all over again. All I wanted to do was log my fasting start time & I don't have time to sit through this. Trying another app!",3

Also one of the ads that was on the app while putting my fasting info in was for Uber eats which had pics of tons of food. A little annoying when I'm trying to fast. Lol. I just wish this app had more to it like measurements, ability to add extras.",3
7620,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Love the app except for 1. Tracks weight but doesn't have a place to see how much weight I've lost so far, only shows pounds per date that I entered and a graph. I'd like to see my total weight loss AND how many pounds I have left to my goal, both would encourage me to keep going! 2. I get that you need ads but this is way more than any app AND they last for way too long. If you change the weight settings I'll add more stars. :)",3

This is a decent app but from what I can tell you have to hit ""finished fasting"" each day then select the timeframe for the next day each time.

Uninstalled because I despise spam notifications and that wouldn't be a problem if I could just turn the water intake notification off but I cant--at least not with the free version. Haven't checked if they allow it on premium but buying premium to remove one notification is asinine.

I don't like how involved it is, there doesn't seem to be an option to design your own weekly custom plan. The app wants you to go in and restart the fasting plan daily.

I particularly like the info on what my body is doing stage by stage. Plenty of choice so finding a fasting regime to suit us pretty easy. Now for the down side, and it's bad enough for me to be 50/50 about using it. The same adds appear constantly and take for ever and ever and ever before you can X out of it. I don't mind the occasional ad that lasts about 3 to 5 seconds but the Phillips ad goes on and on and.",3
7681,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I still use it but some of the ads now require you to wait a full minute before you can get to the data to edit your info. The ads are too much,3
7682,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,The app is okay. It is well built and isn't glitchy. Build-wise i would give the app 5 stars. The problem I had is that what it could do was limited. It is one big timer with no way to track every meal. If it had a function similar to the one for water where we can mark each meal it would be great. Even better would ve to have the chance to write down what the meal was.,3
7683,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Just downloaded the app and it seems like a reasonably good app for tracking fasts and has everything that the average user would need. The main issue I picked up almost instantly is that when you are editing the starting date of a fast you are limited to going back 10 days, this seems like a senseless and arbitrary restriction. I started my fast on the 31st of December, but can only backdate my start point to the 3rd of January which kind of defeats the reason for having the app, to accurately keep track of my hours fasted.",3
7684,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I really wish there was a way to add custom plans without doing it manually. I just want to set a start/end time and get the phase updates along the way.,3
7685,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I do like this app, hence the reason why I subscribed for the year. Unfortunately, it seems to completely ignore my normal meal times when setting up a plan. I have set my breakfast for 7:30 AM and lunch at 4:00 PM but the 15-9 plan sets my eating period to 6:30 AM - 3:30 PM. I can go in and edit them individually but it seems a bit illogical to even ask for the user's meal times, if they aren't considered when assigning a plan. The app looks very good but the function isn't as good as the form.",3
7686,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Honestly I'm only on my 2nd day. I don't know why apps always ask you to rate them before you have a single clue. How much you like it or don't like it. But so far I like it.,3
7687,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Slightly annoying that you can't seem to be able to change the start time of your fast. so if I stop eating at 7pm and remember at 8pm that ""oh yea, have to update the app"", I can't choose the start time of the fast. The app will insist that I have only been fasting since 8pm, so the counter will always show the wrong amount of hours fasted. The ""details"" part is correct, but the elapsed time is not at all. Edit: also confusingly the app looks different this week than the last. Idk why.",3
7688,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I like how simple this app is to use but there is room for improvement. Two things I have had problems with. 1. If I forget to add a drink during or at the end of the day there doesn't seem to be a way I can edit the date/ time. I would like to amend the data so I don't have to log drinks in the app as they happen. 2. I forget sometimes to enter the start time of a fast and it can be messy to try to retrospectively fix the data. Other than that i have found the app helpful and encouraging.,3
7689,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"It's a decent app, except for lack of flexibility in modifying fasting times/lengths. The paid susbscription is a waste of money though, nothing really usefull to pay an extra buck. I wish there was a IF tracker that is more attuned to the female menstrual cycle, that would have been something worth paying.",3
7690,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I have a yearly subscription paid for premium access, but this has been removed since the last update a couple of months ago. I have tried reaching out the developer by email, but still no reply. Can someone help me with this? It is quite frustrating to have ads constantly popping up when I paid in order to not have to deal with them. I love the app, but due to customer service I cannot give more than 3 starts at the moment.",3
7691,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"The app, in theory is great at keeping track of your fasting and non-fasting periods. There is a button to start fasting and one to stop fasting. If you forgot to stop the fasting, then you can go an adjust the time. The problem is, it doesnt always remember when you have told it you have stopped fasting and the next thing you know, the app thinks you have been fasting for over 24 hours. This is very frustrating and has not given me enough confidence in the app to do a paid upgrade.",3
7692,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I started using this app for a weightloss journey. The app had times you could click on and voila!, you're fasting. However, I noticed that scheduling personal timetable on the app comes with its own problems. App waits for you to click the start and end time of your fast if you're not using their recommended plans and if you fail to input this daily, you can't go back and do that, so you end up loosing your progress. Please, change this feature so I can go back to each day and manually input it",3
7693,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"It took some frustration and message exchanges with the developers (kudos for quick reaction) after my previous negative reviews, but finally I got it to work as I wanted, to set a weekly schedule and not bother me every day with having to manually set the fasting start/stop times. Other folks prefer otherwise, and I guess the app does its best to cater to all. I still don't see the long-term value of the subscription, but I guess it's still the best app for this currently in the store.",3
7694,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Very good but! I liked it, it's easy, but i have many problems with, please care for them 1_ its notificatios sound or vibration for every passes second and that's annoying 2_it doesn't alarm me when its time to stop eating or stop fasting and vise versa. 3_ when i enter the app to see the time of eding fast, it calulates from time i enter it but not from the real time i already started .. Thanks for your efforts, hope for this app more of success",3
7695,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Wish the UI was simpler to use and more user friendly/intuitive. If I forget to end my fast in the app, the timer keeps continuing and then I have to go in and manually edit it and it's really cumbersome. I wish it did that by itself according to the time I've set and I could just track my weight. If I start the fasting timer Monday night, forget about it on Tuesday and remember Wednesday, I have to go back and manually enter Monday first and then Tuesday and then start the timer again for Wed.",3
7696,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Good but more work needed. Too manual. It counts the time, but the reminders and notifications don't work all the time, so you have to remember to go in and stop the fasting/eating times and the go in again and edit the time you actually stopped/started eating. Sometimes I think setting reminders in my phone directly might actually do a better job than the app.",3
7697,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Only 3* cos its so static. Once you have read the info you have read it. I don't like the bar chart display of total daily fasting hours as its too simple. Easy to use, I've tried a couple of others and this is much better because it's realiable and easy to amend non standard fasting hours.",3
7698,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I've been using this app for about a year but lately the 30 second ads for some random game make me want to switch. I shouldn't have to sit though an ad that long to start or end fasting which takes 5 seconds to do. Very annoying. A 5 or 10 second ad is fine.,3
7699,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Overall helpful app but the new weeks when I forget to set the plan on time now gives inaccurate info. It shows the time I started it at even though the plan should have started earlier (ie. I started fasting at 6pm, but started this around 6:15 but I can't adjust or change the time to reflect the actual minutes in when I change it back to 6pm it won't add that 15 minutes). It used to but somewhere this broke and needs to be fixed.",3
7700,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Too many ads and not flexible enough So I paid the subscription to remove the ads and unlock Alternate Day fasting, instead of custom. On custom you can start and stop the clock. On alternate day you can't. It assumes u will start eating at midnight even if you set yiur breakfast time to 2pm! So if I stop at 8pm, fast a day and eat again noon the next day, it only records 24hrs instead or nearly 40 fasting. So it's not practical because anything but custom, is not editable to record real time",3
7701,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Only started using this, I have paid for a subscription. Looks good so far, I'm very new to fasting so I'm fumbling my way through this. I would like a diary where I can input my own food then the app can help me by keeping track. Looks to have a lot of potential but I still think it's missing a few tricks which could make it an even better app. I'll stick with it and hope it can help me lose weight. I'll update in a few weeks.",3
7702,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I've been testing this app for more weeks, and I like it. Is there an option to MANUALLY IMPORT or migrate fasting data from another app (LIFE Fasting, for example) or MANUALLY ADD the entries FOR MORE THAN THE LAST 10 DAYS? If this is impossible, then I will have to stick with the same apps that I've been using until now, because I really care about ALL MY FASTING HISTORY. (Your answer suggests that you didn't read the last part of my message. I've edited my review so you can see what I mean.)",3
7703,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I don't get it. Why an app? Been doing IF for 13 months so far. While searching something else I saw and installed this app. Tons of info included. A bit of overwhelm. Simple solution skip one meal a day to limit eating during any eight hour window of your choosing. Mine is noon till 8p.m. No app needed. And no excuses preventing fasting. 'Oh I forgot to set a reminder today guess I'll fast tomorrow.',3
7704,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Functional app, but way too many ads, and they're long ads. I could upgrade, but would have liked to try it out longer to see if I like it.",3
7705,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Its a great app with great potential, but its all ruined by limiting functionality and plans behind a pay wall. Having ads is fine , not having cheat days in the free is fine but limiting your plans is greedy. I will not be paying for premium simply due to these aggressive tactics. 20$ a year isn't too much and I understand you want to give a benefit to the supporters to make it worth the purchase but again. Limiting the plans users can opt for is too much.",3
7706,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Needs better notification options to fix notification bugs. On Samsung S20+ it won't stop vibrating so it has to be silenced. Also needs option to only show timer when actively fasting. Don't need a 24hr notification to tell me it's the eating period. Only care to follow the fasting time. Other than notification issues that it does what it needs to do. Ads aren't about. Good UI. Simple.,3
7707,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Great app but currently too expensive. It would be worth more if you had real personalized insights so for example as a man I wouldn't see recommendations for women. Adding support for meal planning and extending the recepties collection would also be valuable. Adding support for wear os is nice. Otherwise I'm basically paying 20 euro each year for a fancy timer without ads. Or just make it a one time purchase and get a five star review :),3
7708,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,We are being TRACKED BY: GOOGLE+FACEBOOK+AMAZON+ AMPLITUDE. Just to inform you of the above. But I have used intermittent fasting in the past but without the need of an app & I just had my first advert that not only can you not get rid of it but it stays put until it wants to go? I have seriously had enough of most of the apps in Google's apps store mostly for the reasons at the top of this review. But thanks for the heads up as I know that I can do this alone. Uninstalling now.,3
7709,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"For an app that helps losing weight, why is there no widget to update daily weight? Only widget is for water intake, and that's too big and chunky. When entering current weight & target weight, a cool graph with the estimated expected day to hit target weight is shown. This however is nowhere to be found after signing up! Why? Why not show if you're on track to reach your target? Signed up & doing 20/4 intermittent fasting, rendering most content obsolete. Will unsubscribe after first month.",3
7710,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Does what it says but the fact that the ""insights"" stories flip through the pages automatically is REALLY annoying and I can't find a way to make it stop. I'm new to fasting and actually want to read and absorb the info which is challenging enough with small children running around let alone having to flip around to find my place again after momentarily diverting my eyes. Is there a way to stop auto-play? I really don't mind flipping my own pages :)",3
7711,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I'm not getting any notification reminders besides the initial start time one. Then say 62 hours has gone by, I'd have to open the app before it asks ""are you still fasting?"" As in...""have you been fasting a full 62 hours? Go you!"" Like, no, I haven't been fasting for 62 hours straight. Some kind of reminder to ask when the fasting plan you're on has ended just for the day.. would be good to stay on track.",3
7712,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"You guys have done a terrific job on this app. I love how you provide a spot for us to communicate with you on what we would like to see more of in the app, as well as ask questions ~ that shows you really care & for those reasons i stay loyal to you. I thank you for that. I am a paying vip member and it is worth it. I would like to see more sections like an area where we can log in our food and more reminders not just water. I will update my review later ... keep it up guys Ur awesome!",3
7713,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I purchased the Premium and used it for 24 days and didn't lose an ounce. What they don't tell you is that if you're post menopausal it can actually be worse for you to intermittent fast than to do regular eating. If you're hormones aren't just right, they can get even more messed up by fasting and that is what appears to be happening to me. I feel worse today than I did when I started a month ago. I'm done.",3
7714,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,The full screen ads are terrible. Displaying ads isn't the problem. Displaying ads that take the whole screen and prevents you from using the app for its tended purpose is.,3
7715,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I like this app for intermittent fasting, but I feel it could easily lead to eating disorders. It cheers you on for going as long as possible without eating, extolling the benefits of the ultimate 72-hour fast. I wish it had more info on safety and nutrition, particularly info on how many days in a row one should be fasting.",3
7716,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"i really like this app and the interface is smooth but there are so many ads it is unbelievable. sometimes an ad between when I click on it and when I click the button to stop fasting, just so many ads piled on top of each other like this all day. really sucks!",3
7717,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I use the free edition. I like the info given about each phase of fasting. I like the reminders for how much longer I have to go. Please fix the fact I can't close the ads. I have tocome the whole app, some times multiple times, before I can get back into it.",3
7718,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Each and every day, we have to manually end fasting in the app, it doesn't happen automatically by itself. The water widget doesn't work independently, if we click the widget, it directly opens the app, if the water widget works independently without opening the app , it's much better. Also water widget size is huge, they have to decrease the widget size. The app has to be more optimized to use power efficienctly.",3
7719,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I like the app overall, but sometimes it doesn't stop the fasting time, which is extremely annoying, since I rely on the app to track my schedule. I think maybe not all end fasting buttons are synchronised among themselves. Pretty please consider this problem, otherwise I will have to use another app. Thank you!",3
7720,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"It feels bare bones. Lots of good info, but if you don't do it just right, there's no going back. I somehow failed to save my fasting info for a day (shouldn't it automatically save when you click 'end fast'?) and there is no way to manually enter the missing info. So immediately my info is not a reflection of my progress.",3
7721,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Good, but not great. I like the tracking aspect, but the ads are really intrusive. I don't generally mind one ad per use, but this app triggers ads with almost everything you do. You can't even exit the app without an ad! It's crazy!",3
7722,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"It's a basic, simple app that helps me track my fasting. I like this one out of the others because the custom fasting hours isn't behind a paywall. Lower rating because there is a widget for tracking water but not the fasting time which is annoying because I don't like have notifications for apps like this. No note on if the widget is behind a paywall so if that gets answered, great. I'll still be looking for an app that suits all my needs but I really want one with a proper widget so...",3
7723,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Good app for tracking your fasts and full of useful facts for beginners. Down side is the meal plans made ""custom"" for you. I am diabetic and close to reversing it through fasting and keto so having daily meal plans suggesting fruit and bread had me close to deleting it. For fasting it is good but they should not recommend meal plans until they offer a selection for specific diets or conditions.",3

I've fasted at a beginner level for almost a week and can't track it because it has no options to edit previous days! So frustrating!",3
7725,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Great to track down the hours you done. I like the app and i upgraded, but the down side is that when you install it on another phone the data will not be transfer. They need to make people have an real account then the money would be worth it. So far that i had to cancel the membership.",3
7726,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I really like this fasting app because it tells you what your body does at hour intervals and other information. However, the app isn't allowing you to start time for the day before. I think the developers need to create a way for this app to be use on other devices, like my Samsung galaxy active watch, etc. It would definitely be beneficial.",3
7727,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I really liked this app at first. I decided to try the premium because I liked it so much, but when I did, noticed I wouldn't really use too many of the new functions so I wanted to cancel. Can't figure out where to do that on the app when they say ""cancel any time"" I should be able to cancel any time...kind of annoyed that I may have to find a different app since I feel like I'm getting ripped off now.",3

7732,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"The premium version does everything I want. But it has a severe limitation, no continuation between plans, or even no way to set plans longer than a week. It doesn't even restart your plan after the week ends. In my case, this resulted in a customized plan with an autophagy period at the end of the week not being recorded... and no way for me to set it as a continuous fasting period over two consecutive plans. Change that (or make it simpler if it's already there) and the app gets 5 stars.",3

Obviously some of this may be user error, but I cannot seem to find/understand instructions to achieve this.",3
7734,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Was quite good til it stopped working - apart from some of its 'helpful information' which is written as fact when actually there is conflicting science.

7735,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I subscribed thinking that the app will help me or guide me to which kind of fasting is suitable for me..they offer several IF windows and a 28 days meal plan ..that I have no clue what will be best for me ...tried sending feedback for support..and no response for a couple of days now!!!!! I can't start and losing days in my subscription this is frustrating honestly I also sent feedback through application more than once,3
7736,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"When I first downloaded this app, it seemed mundane and almost too plain. But after loading another app and tried to use it, I realised plain means clear and easy to follow.

My fast was done at 130pm but I forgot to stop the app until 345pm and it won't let me change to reflect proper end time. Frustrating!

7740,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"It's a great app, but the only downside for me is that I can't split my fasting into two parts. I skip lunch, but it shows me as eating for 16 hours a day instead of allowing me to set up my plan as 4 hours in the morning, and 4 hours in the evening, and still account for my fasting during sleep. Other than that, it's a great app.",3

Otherwise, it's a great app that does just what I needed it to do.",3
7743,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I like it, even though it's confusing to navigate through it because of the advs. Stupidly, bought a meal plan from another app thinking that was this app (LOL, they got me). I'm working on getting my refund. They advertise everything except their own products.",3
7744,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I've been using this app every time I fast. The app very good and with the deals the pricing gets better as well. The only request is to add a widget to end and start the fast. I'm surprised that your developer never thought about it.,3
7745,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I want to make sure I'm not charged automatically year after year, and I don't know where to find that. I also don't see the Take A Break ""button"" that has been mentioned...is that only on iPhone? O also don't see where I can customize my plan. I wonder if I have ALL of the options for my $19.99. I appreciate not having the ads, but I think that's basically the only benefit for me.",3
7746,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Doesn't work as expected. To end fasting needs user act, trying to correct end fast time causes plan to abort and the need to select again. When it works, it's good, but counter intuitive controls spoil it",3
7747,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Simple app for keeping track of your fasting cycle. However the only notification that works is the water reminder. Start of fast and end of fast reminders don't seem to work at all.,3
7748,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I'm so confused. When you have finished a fasting and it goes into eating time. Does it automatically go back to fasting when it's time or do i have to start the fasting on the app again myself? How do you know how long you have left for the eating time. Iv just done a 20h fast and have just set a reminder for the next fast at 8.30. Would be handy if it just ran one after other when you select your plan.,3

7752,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Yeah really good app. If I had one criticism is that is it trying to do too much - lot of information there whereas you might just be looking for a simple timer. I also couldn't see an edit button for those times you might want to change start time.,3
7753,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I started my tracker a couple hours after I started fasting and I don't see anywhere to edit a fast. Usually on other fasting apps, it's simply a slide of a button. Honestly, I don't like that.",3
7754,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Very motivating and a fun way to get into intermittent fasting. But definitely too expensive for what it delivers. I whish they'd have a yearly subscription like others do at a steep discount. But having to pay so much every month, I will cancel as soon as I am used to fasting.",3
7755,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"it's good but sometimes when I click the ""stop fasting"" or ""begin fasting"" button, I'll come back to the app to see that it didn't actually record that time, and now I'm stuck trying to guess what time it was, and I end up not having an accurate time for my fast/eating period",3
7756,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I like that there is a weight tracking tool. But the major downside is that you can't edit when you stopped your fast. So in my case my phone was off and my fast time was off by 5 hours. If you could edit fast ending times this app would recieve 4/5 stars.,3
7757,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Great app that keeps me focused on my health goals. Thumbs up! Update (17.11.20): Everything was OK so far, but today I start receiving ads in Portuguese, which I don't understand, so I don't know which button to click to exit ad. And it's getting annoying...",3
7758,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,This app is great for reminders to drink etc. My issue is that it drains my battery quite quickly and locks up my phone. There was a noticeable difference in the way my phone performed once I uninstalled.,3
7759,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Nice app, but found a fail. The program should let me change the time of my fasting during the fasting program without changing the program. I have started the 14/10 program but decided to keep fasting for longer period cause I'm feeling good. I tried to add more time of fasting but the program doesn't allow me to do it.",3
7760,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"It would be better if the fasting cycles started and stopped automatically (based on the time schedule you set) and just notified me, instead of having to manually go in and start/stop it each time, which I always forget to do and then the next day it thinks I've been fasting for 24+hours and the cycle is all thrown off.",3
7761,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Decent app but very difficult to change plans. It should be easy to start with a 14 10 and then realize you can manage 15 9 or 16 8 and make that change easily. Constant error that you are currently fasting. And I paid for the full app. So there's no excuse.,3
7762,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"The app is extremely user friendly but support needs some improvement. I have sent several Emails about issues, some are resolved but the main one, syncing with Google Fit, is still outstanding and have not heard from them. I would give it 5 stars if support improved.",3
7763,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I liked the different fasting plans and being able to edit your fasting start time, but I didn't like that I couldn't change the end time of my fasting. For that, I'm uninstalling because I want something flexible on all ends for accurate tracking.",3
7764,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"It's a great app. The problem is that options for more than 24hrs are written off as ""Custom"". This doesn't allow a person to keep track of time left to a, say, 36hr fast. I suggest you add an option for adjustable fasts >20hrs",3
7765,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Would be great but the ads Omg. At first it wasn't that bad but then it got overbearing. I could understand banner ads but just trying to sign in and lock something and with everything I do it's now requiring an ad. After having it for a while I'm finally uninstalling.,3
7766,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Please add a function to turn off the notification noise of the 'drink water reminder', without putting my phone on silent. It's always way too loud and and the sound it makes is difficult to explain. Honestly my only complaint rn so I'll up ot to a five if this is added. Thank you.",3
7767,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I really like it and it was great the fir two or three weeks. But then it kept changing my fasting/eating times. It was weird and annoying. I would finish a fasting period and an hour or two later it would signal that my fasting period had become. Please fix!,3
7768,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I really like the app! However I give it 3 stars because i dont like when you try to edit the history of your fast it automatically sets It to the day before. For example I fasted from 830pm yesterday (3/21) to today(3/22) 1230pm. I initially ended the fast but then I decided to wait to eat, pushing my time to 230pm. When I tried to edit the already saved fast, it preset the start and end dates to 3/21, therefore making it look as if I didn't fast the full 18hrs. Fix this and its 5 stars",3
7769,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"The original problem has been fixed,, but now if i need to go back to 2 days to edit it aborts the fast. There is a glitch. I emailed about this also. If you forget to abort your fast, and go back to adjust the time, it will not let you adjust it for the same day. You have to choose yesterday. Then go back to re-adjust the time to the correct day on the next day. It gets confusing. And very annoying. Seems like it should be a simple fix too. Wish you would just fix it. I did pay for the app.",3
7770,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"The design is great. I love the water reminders, the education aspect is very helpful but the fasting time starts automatically. On the days where I start fasting a little earlier or a tad later I'd like to adjust for that easily without accidentally disrupting my week.",3
7771,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"The app itself is great. The graphic and everything makes it unique and user friendly. However, it's the idea that the app is based on that I have serious issues with. Fasting regularly is not healthy at all. I wanted to get thin so bad that I overlooked this fact and installed the app anyway. It had reverse effect on my eating habit. I got so hungry I could nearly show no self control. You're a good team, please revise your core value (of fasting)",3
7772,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"For the price of the subscription, And the app shows protein and fat nutrition pictures. I thought we could save the food we eat and have a record and track the protein, fat and all minerals intake. Just the recipes alone few insights and plans extra for a yearly subscription is a waste. I'm from different culture and your recipes are of no use to me. And you ask if what diet but according to that I couldn't see any specific diet it's all random nonveg recipes. Add food tracker for a 5 stars.",3
7773,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"It works as a timer... and that seems to be it. I never get notified before or after a fasting/eating period, even though I've set them to notify me. Sometimes I start or end my fasts late because I don't get the hour reminder. Worked first day, never again. But it tracks like it says, so 🤷‍♀️",3
7774,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"There IS A BIG BUG when you choose to have alerting notifications : it vibrates and makes each seconds, because the notification refreshes. You HAVE to put it in silent notifications so it won't bother you. Developers have a look at this. Used on Google Pixel 3XL Android 10.x",3
7775,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,When I got a new phone I lost all my data. I backup everything on micro SD & cloud acct... All lost. Months of fasting records vanished. What good is the app if it doesn't keep records? I sent feedback to the developer so maybe they will fix it. I'll update here if they do.,3
7776,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Frustrating to use - can't read articles although the app shows you plenty of them. It just wants me to sign up and pay for the app....constant messages that are obnoxious. Of course you want me to pay, but I need to use it for a time to see if it works for me before paying for the use of it. Will probably uninstall and go elsewhere",3
7777,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,So far I enjoy the app. It can be synthesized with the Google Fit app and has dark mode but I recently got a new phone and could not find any way of actually creating an account or transferring you history/activity from the old device... please advise/add this feature,3
7778,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"The free app is ok, not too many ads and short. Does a good job reminding you to get water, recording times, weight. But many other apps do the same. Hence, the three stars.",3
7779,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Just completed my first day of fasting, doing the 16/8. It notified me that I made it, I click on it, it asked me when my last meal was(yesterday at 7pm) and it says it has not been long enough to be considered fasting. It's been 16 hours. -.- But now according to the app I have never completed a fast. Edit: when it's asking you to note last meal, it's under the assumption you already ate to start the eating on the next day wish it was clearer on what it's asking for. Avoid confusion for people",3
7780,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Been using this app for a few months and just decided pay for the no ads version today. It's good. My only issue is that the data did not pull over from my old phone. Is there a way to set up an acct or transfer data? Please reach out to me as I can see my progress history now. 😢 🙏 At the moment taking stars off for that.,3
7781,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"A little too detailed and a little too invasive for my comfort. There appears to be no way to control personal data once you have it. I could see some folks liking the heavy coaching, but I do not like it.",3
7782,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,It reminds me to hydrate. Keeps track of my fasting time. I like the app. It is doing exactly what I would expect it to do. Only a few plans available though unless you upgrade to premium.,3
7783,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"The app works well but the 3 stars are for having to double tap, past their ads, to get out of the app. Its VERY annoying. I wouldn't recommend this one, and I'm looking for another app for that reason.",3
7784,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Annoying that I can't delete or change old data as I put in my weight wrong and now it looks like I've lost a bunch of weight in a day just because I corrected it. It's a good, basic app but this is annoying.",3
7785,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Honestly this is a great tracker and supports you throughout the entire process. But the reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because it can also make you feel guilty and more self concious feelings come up when that happens. After my friends realized I was on a type of diet, they asked me why I wanted to do that, bc I should feel comfortable with what I look like. I don't think it means to, but the app makes you think that you're willing to starve yourself bc you want to look more ""pretty""",3
7786,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"This app should be able to stop and start based on the time you set. You should be able to hear an alarm for start and end times. Instead, it makes you manually do this and then shifts the time if you don't stop the clock. Please fix this on the app.",3
7787,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I really liked the app. But within days of using it you begin to have to go though multiple ad screens that are annoying and you can't close them for a period of time. I'm uninstalling the app.,3
7788,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Love even a free version. Going to get a subscription. P.s. I regret I wasted money on subscription. No 12/12 fasting, custom was there anyway but it does not have notifications, menu is a just ""Maggie diet"" that isn't healthy, I also did not find an option for 1 day break.",3
7789,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,It's ok for a basic app. I've had better free apps. You have to pay to read articles (google it instead - free and probably more info) and there is only a water tracker widget rather than a widget that keeps track of hours. I'm going to keep searching and ditch this one. Response to devs: I want a free app. Health should not only be accessible to those who have money. I found a better app and I can google articles if need be. Thanks.,3
7790,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"It doesn't seem to offer a connection to the Fitbit app to import weight, etc. Otherwise I like the reminders to drink water and the easy interface.",3

I haven't used this app in a long time I do not want to give any feedback. I want to cancel subscription. Any reason why u did not give that option to cancel subscription. Can mine immediately. This is my second request in a row in 2nd month My 4th request to unsubscribe I have done what u have asked me, even sent an email. Am I unsubscribed yet ?? No response from the team at all but taking money",3
7792,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Even though notifications to do so are on, the app doesn't give me indicators if when my fasting period is due to start/stop so i have to mentally track times on my own. It kind of makes the app redundant as a result.",3
7793,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I would have rated this a 5 Stars based on how informative and motivating this tracker is for fasting!

Jason Fong offers more information for about the cost of a yearly membership to this ap.",3
7795,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Good but needs more options for trial users. Also, when I first started using this (I'm 10 days in), I was able to edit how much water I drank on previous days and now I can't. For the life of me can't figure out why, and usually I'll forget to count all the water I drank that day, so it's necessary for me to go back and correct it the next day. Please fix this and I will pay and give 5 stars!!!",3
7796,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"So far, tracking of the fasting is working well. However, I would have liked to have been able to track food as well and have had to download another app for this purpose. Would be must better to have it all in one place.

I selected to pay one month premium of Rs. 350/- which is already debited from my bank account through GPay.. But my premium subscription is not reflecting on the app.. The app is still asking me to buy the premium pack.. Why so..? What about my paid money..? Kindly resolve..,3
7798,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Wish there were more ""free articles"" to help out. I want to see more content to see what they have to truly offer those of us who are a step above beginners not quite well versed.... Really see if those tid bits are worth the subscription cost!",3
7799,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Very supportive and informative but I wish it was easier to set your own fasting schedule. Other apps are a bit easier in this respect and perhaps this could be improved so you can add other times/days,3
7800,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,The app is good but there should be an option for choosing vegetarian diet plan. The dirt options provided are all a mix of both non-veg and veg.,3
7801,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I wish I could turn off achievements (super annoying)and have a calendar for past days with stats. Will get a five star when that ever happens.,3
7802,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"This app is very nice and I've been using it for a long time every time I want to fast. My only gripe is that I don't want to subscribe to be able to access more fasting options. I don't care about recipes or cheat days, I just want to stop the ads and have more options of fasting. I don't need anything more. They offer an option to remove the ads but not an option to unlock more fasting methods. Perhaps join them both in a one time purchase? That's the only reason why I don't give them a 5",3

7808,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Honestly I'm only on my 2nd day. I don't know why apps always ask you to rate them before you have a single clue. How much you like it or don't like it. But so far I like it.,3

However, it's the idea that the app is based on that I have serious issues with. Fasting regularly is not healthy at all.

I started fasting at 6pm, but started this around 6:15 but I can't adjust or change the time to reflect the actual minutes in when I change it back to 6pm it won't add that 15 minutes).

I also don't see the Take A Break ""button"" that has been mentioned...is that only on iPhone? O also don't see where I can customize my plan. I wonder if I have ALL of the options for my $19.99.

7920,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Honestly this is a great tracker and supports you throughout the entire process. But the reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because it can also make you feel guilty and more self concious feelings come up when that happens. After my friends realized I was on a type of diet, they asked me why I wanted to do that, bc I should feel comfortable with what I look like. I don't think it means to, but the app makes you think that you're willing to starve yourself bc you want to look more ""pretty""",3

Does it automatically go back to fasting when it's time or do i have to start the fasting on the app again myself? How do you know how long you have left for the eating time.

7974,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Very good app for recording and keeping track of your fast, but the ads are so obnoxious. Edit: I understand you need ads to stay free, but it's still annoying to insert 1 minute *unskipable* ads when I just want to record my progress, and when I do there's another ad immediately.

7975,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I thought that it was free It was when I finished putting all the information that I got to know that I will have to pay before doing anything why is it so please?,3

The app is easy to navigate, shows days and hours fasted, and days you did not fast. I like that you can input your measurements, but it is not a requirement to use the app. There is bite-sized information throughout the app. I find that useful. Unfortunately, you don't get to see all the info without a paid version. But I'm ok with that.",4
8001,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I really love this app. One thing that stops it from getting 5 stars is the fact that there is no calendar layout to see the fasted days. Instead there is only the option to see the timeline. I think having a calendar-like monthly layout with green dots on fasted days and the number of hours inside the dots will dramatically enhance the user-experience. It will give the user a more frienndly and holistic view of his fasting experience throughout an extended period of time.,4
8002,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I haven't had any problems. Mostly reviewing to state my interest in a couple features that the app doesn't have currently: - A version of the app for the Samsung Galaxy watches. Especially if there is a feature for adding a percentage bar or something to the watch face. - I love that it shows my status on my lock screen, I would love if I had something similar as an option on my home screen as a widget",4
8003,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Just started using it. Trying the free version. So far app is easy to use. Not glitchy. Only hang up is the notification alerts have no sound. Just has a notification bar displayed, so when the timer is up, there's no sound alert. My volume is turned up in settings.",4
8004,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Edit: can you PLEASE add creating custom plans? I want to manually plug in some hours but I can't even with the premium! Keeps you accountable! One of the biggest struggles with fasting, especially when doing it for long periods of time, is that you need something to keep you going. This really helps put fasting into perspective with features such as fasting phase summaries and time trackers, it's really helped me to keep on track.",4
8005,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Good UI with a small amount of confusion as it shows both current fast and overall hours fasted , but developer cleared it up. We expect ads apart from the premium version and know this is how developers make a living, but sometimes feels like there's a pop up more often than other ""free"" apps. I'd still highly recommend this for helping with weight loss, better memory and more energy. After only a week, I feel so much better!",4
8006,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Great app that has a lot of helpful information. Only thing I hate about it is the daily achievements that pops up. If it was on major milestones, great, but not every day! I cannot find a way to turn off achievements. You can turn off water and fasting reminders but not achievements. Once I have a way to turn that off, rating will go up to 5 star.",4
8007,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Great! I've done intermittent fasting for a year, but found my self at a plateau, then gained a bunch back. After 4 days back on w this app, it holds me accountable for the water I need to drink and does the math for when it starts and ends. I wish there was a section to in the food I'm consuming. Some days after my dinner I'm full and close my window, only being open for can hour or 2 instead of 4. A target should pop up if that's good or bad. But I love the water and time tracking",4
8008,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Great so far! I've tried a few diff apps and I really ♥️ this one. The flat fee to get rid of ads is perfect. It's difficult to figure out if you want to subscribe to a plan if you are dealing w/the ads. I LOVE a lot of the free membership tips & info. They are truly helpful and educational. One suggestion: the water tracker. If the tracker page could just have the various amount 'buttons' to push the amount you drank OR just an entry field to enter an amount that would be WAY more efficient.,4
8009,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"The basic function of tracking intermittent fasting hours vs eating hours works adequately. It's less flexible than I wish, but does the job. I like how easy it is to toggle between time fasting to time remaining. I edited my critique after the developers reached out. They are very responsive. On a positive note, with the help of this app, I've lost 20 lbs in 2 months.",4
8010,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Of the 4 fasting apps I've tried this is the best. I like how it keeps a reminder on my notifications about the timer and the state my body is in. I recommend a few improvements. I wish there was a water tracker so I wouldn't have to use two different apps. Also, I wish there was a widget. To permanently dock the app on my page and I also wish starting and stopping the fast timer were easier. there are no Galaxy smart watch apps for fasting, that would make it easier to keep track.",4
8011,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Recently started and so far I like it; I would recommend it should the opportunity come up. I'm hoping the developers will see this and take into consideration adjusting the financial aspect of things. I'm not sure what comes with the premium version but I'd consider getting it for a one time price rather than a monthly subscription. There are nice featuresv already. Premium may offer just a little more. I'm just not sure if the ""more"" it offers justifies monthly payments indefinitely.",4
8012,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Love this tracker! After only a week I upgraded to no ads. I only wanted an app that helped me track my weight and fasting times. This is very simple and straightforward. No need to create an account anywhere. No extra tasks or assignments to complete. If you don't need the extra motivation that comes with fasting buddies or gold stars or earned cheat days, this is definitely for you. If it tracked the total weight lost and lost in the last 7 days, it would get 5 stars.",4
8013,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Kinda wish there was an easier way to track my start and end times? I can't seem to change the time on when I actually have my first meal for the day, only my last one. So, I feel like it doesn't accurately reflect my times for fasting, as some times it's longer and other times it may be a little shorter (I have an odd work schedule that mostly determines my meal times). Otherwise, I love the app.",4
8014,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Been using it for a little over a month or so. I have such difficulty sticking with fasting, but this app has really helped keep me accountable, plus it's simple and there's not a ton of ads or ""extra features"" in your face. The overlay timer is a great constant reminder, and I like the water reminders. Only improvement I'd want is an option for the timer to be counting down and not up.",4
8015,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,It's a good app and does what it says it does. I wish there were alternative diet plans available to customize the individual experience. I prefer a keto/carnivore eating plan and don't want to be encouraged to eat things i know are not healthy for MY body. I'd also like a widget showing my progress. There are a lot of little things that could make the app more user friendly.,4
8016,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Log daily since 12-4-20. Features useful, but I don't find it to be a very intuitive design. Not always obvious what is where, or that additional subscreens even exist - have to try tapping everything that could be a ""button"". Major glitch - every time I record a fasting start or stop time, click 'DONE' and verify that the info appears everywhere it should be, then close the app - when reopened, the last time recorded will be gone. I've had a completed fast disappear altogether.2-22 Improved-4☆!",4
8017,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Pretty good. Does it's job. Ads not really invasive. Can't complain. Only problem I have with it is that if you start to fall off from your routine there doesn't seem to be a way to get it to bug you about it. Did 18 hour fasts for 15 days and it was quick to notify me about everything, but it stopped after two days of heavy eating for myofibrillar hypertrophy training. Even once I picked back up on fasting, I made sure all notifications were on, it still acted funny.",4
8018,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"So far so good. I used fastic for a year, and wanted to try something different. Fastic was free, and did not have ads interrupting every 5 seconds, you just didn't get the premium content. This app is nice visually, and has a great reminder feature, but the ads do get annoying. I can manage it though as it is only a minor inconvenience.",4
8019,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I downloaded in 2020 and it helped me lose weight! It helped a lot. I re-downloaded to get back into IF, however the app did change a bit. I'm not too crazy on the water tracker (just personal preference), I'm not too crazy on all the ads, and I'm still getting used to the stories and tips and all that, but it looks helpful! I'm excited to use it :)",4
8020,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Excellent app! I love that it allows you to track your weight, something that many others don't include for some reason. Also love that it includes information about what typically happens during certain periods of the fast ( such as when you go into ketosis, autophagy, etc). I only wish there was a way to track food intake for days and times when not fasting. I have to use another app for that, unfortunately. Otherwise, excellent and useful app.",4
8021,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Pros Really like the fasting status (ketosis, autophagy, etc. Helps keep me motivated. I think this is the only fasting app that does this so well. Cons. - roller time picker is annoying, looks amateur, and requires so many taps. Calendar and analog clock is far more efficient. Another fasting app with the same name uses the better one. - Pro is to expensive for an app that is really just a timer. Lower the price, lose the subscription, and more users will gladly pay.",4
8022,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I like the tracker. I paid for premium and have made use of the app for a while now. I don't need the water tracker, but it's there. I like the ability to change fasting times. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to track accurately. When I look at my history the times are wrong. It makes it hard to track progress unless I look at each day individually I don't know the correct information. I would love to be able to track progress.",4
8023,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"So far I like it..just finished my first fast. I will say I wish it had came with a tutorial, because I had to blindly navigate the app and figure out how it worked without direction. I've never done IF before so didn't know how it worked. Once I did, it was fairly clear how to get started. A tutorial would have saved me about an hours time. I went ahead and upgraded to get the full experience without the annoying ads.",4
8024,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"It's a great app, but it could be better. Once you set the parameters for Fasting you can't seem to adjust it while in one of the modes. For example if you're in fasting mode and you decide to fast an additional hour you can't make the adjustments. There is an abort button, but that implies you're erasing your progress including previous day's.",4
8025,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Easy to learn, easy to use. Perfect for anyone new to intermittent fasting. I wish it gave me more control over the amount and type of liquids I use to hydrate like the WaterMinder app does so I could track what I'm hydrating with, when, and how much. That's the only thing that's missing and the reason I knocked a star off. Otherwise, there's a lot to love about this app! Pro Tip: Use a weekly fasting schedule. Then the app tells YOU what to do, instead of you having to tell IT daily. ;-)",4
8026,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"With simple pamphlet like files and a timer that you can start anytime you want, The app is useful in helping you fast. Obviously there is the premium for the full features of the app. And even though you have ads for the lesser version of the app, You can still enjoy its features. You can still do what you're wanting to do without needing the premium.",4
8027,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I've used this app for a week now and I really like it. It's a bit confusing to have to restart a plan at the weeks end though, but so far it's helped keep me on track and accountable with ease. Really like how cute the UI is too and how minimalist everything is. It's nice seeing an app that found a good balance between UI and UX without sacrificing one over the other.",4
8028,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"It's a great app for the most part. The only issue I have is that I tried to give them feedback about some innacuracies in their 'learn section,' and it failed. So I'll leave the feedback here: Unless one is already in a state of ketosis via a strict keto one wont reach a state of autophagy until over 72 hours of fasting. And if one is 'eating whatever they like' in between fasting (which is what the app says you can do and still lose weight), you're not going to reach ketosis after 12 hours.",4
8029,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"it's a great app for tracking and i love that there are little health information slides. however, the fasting tracker itself can be really confusing. i can't tell you how many times i've meant to start fasting and it thought i started an eating period. just today i woke up to it thinking i was eating for 14 hours instead of fasting... it's really annoying when it does this and really hard trying to fix it. you can't undo it, you have to manually change the tracked time. really irritating.",4
8030,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Love this app, so far it's given me motivation to fast. I have 2 suggestions. First add an option to create a specific notification sound. That way I could hear when it's almost time to fast if I'm not looking at my phone. Second create a timer that can show how much time is left during the fasting window. When I'm getting hungry I'd like to see immediately how much time is left instead of calculating it in my head. So similar to the eating period countdown. Having both numbers is encouraging.",4
8031,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"This is a nice app. I especially like having notifications (e.g., ""Eating period). Suggestion: make it harder to accidentally start/stop fasting. There have been several times where I know I've started fasting but then the next morning I see ""Have you started fasting yet? ' It's frustrating because sometimes I don't remember what time I started.",4
8032,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"It's just a timer and tracker as it says so I give it four stars. It would be great to have some other health tips, articles or videos linked to intermittent fasting. So far I realize that the time does help a person like me to stick to it. The countdown method works for me. No problems so far and trophies tracking progress is cool.",4
8033,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Seems good so far. Simple to use,wide variety of plans. My only complaint is that I just wish that they had more widgets. I appreciate the water widget because I don't usually drink enough water, but a widget to have a visual reminder of how much time you have left in your fast/until your fast is over would be much more helpful than having to open the app every time.",4
8034,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Useful ! I only used the free version, and despite the fact that it had ""way too much information"" for my needs, I was surprised at the practical difference using 'an app' made. This particular app really helps encouraging me to drink more water, which makes all the difference between a mediocre fast and an awesome experience. I tried since fasting without the app, and I haven't been as successful.",4
8035,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"This is a great app. It's VERY simple and user friendly. This would be great for someone who isn't tech savvy. (My grandmother could figure this out!)There are other apps that have more features and benefits - but this one is to the point for your most basic fast tracking and overall guidance. Good app if you're testing out the IF lifestyle for sure. The water intake reminder is a great added bonus! Overall, satisfied!",4
8036,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I tried the free app then paid for premium app, not much of a difference between the two. I was having issues setting up fasting time on premium app, reached out to developer and they assisted me. Unfortunately, the fasting plans I am using do not have it to where you can backdate the time if you need to correct it, you can only do that in the custom feature. I changed to 4 star rating since developer responded. But really, you can use free app and still get great features without premium pmt.",4
8037,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Love this app, primarily for the fasting timer bar I can see on my lock screen, so I don't have to open the app. The one thing that would make this 5 star is if the ""eating period"" bar also had a timer counting the time my window has been open. Would make it quick and easy to see that on the home screen when the window is open. Please, please add!",4
8038,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Have been using this app for several weeks now. Initially, I gave a low star rating due to a small issue that turned out to be my fault. But since figuring the problem out, I use the app on a daily basis and like it. I use custom settings instead of the plans. Because i do long-term fasting instead of intermittent. Going upwards of thirty to forty days.",4
8039,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I like the app offers shorter fasting periods such as the 16:8 hour fast in addition to the more strenuous fasting options. I can't give it 5 stars because of the way the app forces all measurement to be either imperial or metric. I measure my weight in imperial pounds, I measure my water in metric mm/cc. The app will break if I switch the water count to metric while my weight is in imperial pounds. Also I wish the water tracker was a bit more flexible. You have to program it every time you drink water if you don't always drink the same amount. If the app brought up the different sizes instead of the + button it would make me more likely to use the water tracker. Currently I use a separate app because it is faster and more convenient.",4
8040,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I love this app so far. The only request I could make would be to allow us to set our intended length on a custom fast. That way we can still see the percentage complete on the wheel like when using a set fast length, as well as the other benefits of a predefined fast. I want to start 23:1 and I know that's a popular option for fasting but I don't expect you to accommodate everything.",4
8041,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Insightful app for beginners. If you're new to this fasting journey, this app definitely sets you on the right path. I have done research independent of this app, and the app provokes the right questions to ask about which fast is better suited for me. I feel more equipped to handle what I may or may not encounter. I am utilizing the free version, which is limited as far as more in-depth information, but as I stated, the app does an excellent job pointing you in the right direction.",4
8042,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Love this app great help with tracking how long I've been fasting for n how long I have left. Tracks water, and weight chart is nice. I get lots of notifications reminding to drink water and stuff. I gave this 4 stars bc I think it would be even more useful if they put recipes in the app that r good to have when in the period of not fasting. Super impressive otherwise!!",4
8043,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,This is a nice app so far compared to the other app I had that didn't even give me real time tracking notifications and it was more expensive.. I immediately uninstalled that. I'm liking this one better BUT The only downside is my notification bar reminder constantly goes away. I have to keep the app constantly running in the background. If there was a way to keep the notification up or a fix for this that would be great.,4
8044,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Work-around for constant Smart Phone Notification. As another review said, this app's notification is sending endless notifications to smart watches. Literally several times per second. This, of course, renders the watch useless. I can turn off notifications sent to my watch on an app by app basis, but that is a Work-around, NOT a Solution. An in-app solution exists by being able to turn off the constant notification (turn off ""Notification Bar""). This should also reduce battery drain.",4
8045,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Good concept. I like how it educates while in use. It explains what your body is doing in each hour of fasting. For me, however, having a count down made it harder. I downloaded it because I was almost doing Intermittent fasting as is. But seeing the tracker just reminded me of food. Also, default to drink water is every hour. I usually drink 80 oz a day naturally. When it went off every hour I ended up with over 150 oz and felt bloated , foggy, and not normal. Change the reminder to 5 hours",4
8046,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I'm trying to lose a few ""vanity"" pounds and my wife turned me into this app and it seems like a doable task. My only gripe with if is that it doesn't seem transferrable, meaning that I have to start over on different phones. Doesn't keep track on my progress when I switch phones. Going to do this for a few weeks and see what happens.",4
8047,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Dont like being forced to choose a weekly tracker so I don't have to reset my fasting time everyday. Figured out how to use the weekly plan 2 hrs into my fast.I also had to manually change the time for every single day. It was cumbersome. Selecting 18-6 and setting time for the whole week would be ideal. The last thing is there is no way to show the hours left vs the elapsed time.,4
8048,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"*response to dev: you didn't read the whole review -_- I said it's fine now that I paid, I changed no settings* I upgraded and bought the year subscription, which fixed the issue of the sticky notification disappearing, and the app is working as it should now. The free version used to be amazing, and I almost gave it up because it was useless with notifs not working or the time disppeared, but I figured since I use it so much I'd just buy since it was discounted, and all the issues are gone.",4
8049,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Overall I like this app. I have met my weight goals over the past few months, in large part due to the ""tiny accountability"" of this app. One complaint: it doesn't accurately ""save"" my start and end times. I have to re-enter them each morning and night! Frustrating! But otherwise, I like it.",4
8050,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,The app works really well and is helpful keeping track of fasting windows. Right now it only shows daily fasting charts. It would be nice if it would roll up trends weekly and monthly (eg graph of number of fasting hours per week and per month) so you can see overall trends.,4
8051,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Love this app! Love the notifications explaining the science throughout my fast. Helps remind me of why I'm doing it. Two things: 1. Give us a widget for tracking the fast like the competition has (but don't eliminate the persistent notifications). 2. PLEASE be the first to market with a WearOS watch app for fasting. Even include a watch face that is green during eating and red during fasting.,4
8052,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I enjoy how simple this app is. I love how to explains whats happening during each hour of fasting and has the option to have the timer in your notification bar. Its a great reminder. Only downside is there isn't an option to add water intake to a previous day. I stay up late so say i drink some water around 11pm but dont put it into my phone right away and its past 12am when i go back on my phone, i dont have the option to go back to add to that day! If there is a way to do it, idk how 🤦🏼‍♀️",4
8053,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"This is what I've been looking for to track IF, and I'm quite happy to pay the $20/yr for the premium version just for the month long plans. It can feel a bit 'duh' if you're familiar with IF, but it's genuinely the simplest app I've found. I wish there were more recipes and that the full weekly plans adjusted when you change the start time (or if you had the option to pick WHEN those plans started instead of having them start right that second), but overall I'm pretty happy with my choice.",4
8054,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I love this app!!! It makes fasting so much fun (especially with the hour by hour summaries of what is happening to the body). I do want to ask if we can get a feature that lets us to have a lower hour (like 16) and a higher hour (like 20) for our fasting sessions. If we make it inside those parameters our fast is seen as a success.,4
8055,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Using app for 7 weeks (for IF). Easy to use and it does what it's supposed to, track fasting. The timer is what I use most to remember fast start and end time. Improvement: graph tracks total time fasted in 24 hr from midnight to midnight even if it's not continuous fast. This is not a true measure of each individual fast duration. More useful is to graph duration of each CONTINUOUS fast. (e.g. 9pm to next day 5 pm)",4
8056,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Functionality-wise, this is very close to what I was looking for. Interface is flexible and user friendly, no noticable bugs.

8057,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"This is a great app, and I really love the info on the app. I also really love the messages in the app notifications that show up in my notification bar telling me what my body is doing during each fasting interval, it's very encouraging! The only thing I don't like is you can't edit the water intake on a previous day. I like the water widget, but I would also like a widget to start and end my fast.",4
8058,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Im new to fasting and this app has really guided me well. Using the free version, may upgrade if the drinking function was more adaptable; I sometimes forget to add water after it switches past midnight, there is no way to add those ounces to the correct day, it kind of messes with me - I'm new at this & already thinking about so many other aspects of the new lifestyle I can't remember everything exactly on time. Overall REALLY helpful for this newbie. 💓",4
8059,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"The app does a great job tracking your progress and being informative. Although it's not stated in the description, this app is very geared toward women. The app just assumes you're a woman, and much of the information concerns female issues. That's great, but I wish the tone of the app was more unisex. Women are definitely not the only ones fasting!",4
8060,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"It took forever to set up, and that was skipping all the personal info BUT no log in and personal info is a huge plus. The ads aren't too bad if you aren't clicking around a lot. I only use the timer feature, which stays active in the notification panel. As far as the widget, it's a water reminder. 😐",4
8061,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Loving the app so far. The only down side for me is that you cannot edit the times on the weekly plans. If I were able to do that, it would be 5 stars! I love the phases and the facts about each phase. It helps to know what my body is doing. I love the notification in my control panel with the time remaining. I also like that you can record how you are feeling as you go. That will be helpful to reflect on!",4
8062,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Great. This app is awesome. I use it mostly to give other people insight into something I already do. So when getting people interested, I can just show them this app to get them started. Personally, for update material, i'd like to see a notepad or somewhere to note when you've worked out, or it's been very hot or cold outside. This should give an accountability for this water, not related to fasting but something I do. Its better to drink too much than not enough. Great job all devs. Cheers.",4
8063,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Pretty simple and easy to use tracking app for fasting. Only has 12-12 to 18-6 intermittent fasting plans on the free version, so if you want to fast for any other ammount of time, you have to let your fast go over the time limit, buy the ""premium"" service or use a different app/ track on your own.",4
8064,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I have been using this app for the a few weeks and I really like it! I love how its on my pull down menu telling me how long I've been fasting and which level I'm at and in the app it explains what's taking place in the body during each level. It has nice little quick Info tidbits to help you along and you can track your weight also. My one issue with the app is through the custom feature for fasting longer then 20 hours. It would be nice to be able to input what your goal time is, and track it!",4
8065,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I love this app. I have never actually fasted before. I downloaded this app randomly just because. After reading through some of the little short articles I decided that I wanted to actually try fasting. It's a little hard to get my mind off eating when EVERYONE is eating around me. But I am also working on my self discipline so it works perfectly together!!,4

Forget other apps that are just expensive calorie counters - this tracker is the real deal for metabolism and healing... I have few complaints because it's so robust and useful but until I can rewrite water history after midnight I have to give just 4 stars. If your fasting time was inaccurate you can edit it any time, but I can't add the water I drank before I fell asleep to that day's counter? Huh? Put that in the free vers for the 5star 🤩",4
8067,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I like this app very much. It's helpful and easy to use if you are not good at remembering when your start and finish time ( I can't be the only one). The problem I have, is if you have a break then start again. I can't seem to find the old wait loss plan and the progress charts. Hopefully someone can help me retrieve this information.",4
8068,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Really good app. Very useful and practical. I would give it 5 stars if it allow one time purchase. I don't like monthly subscriptions. However, If you are trying to get healthy, fasting and not eating garbage is very important. This app is so helpful. I purchased the AD removal. A MUST HAVE APP FOR A BETTER HEALTH.",4
8069,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I like it overall, but there are certain aspects it could be improved -Would be great if you could change the beginning of the week as to Monday instead of Sunday. -Be able to take part in different challenges simultaneously instead of only doing one at a time -Diary back log could be looking neater than different ones all within the same app I pay for the premium version so as a loyal customer I hope you guys could take on board this constructive feedback.",4
8070,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Paid for the subscription. I like the fact you can change and customize your own fasting plans. Also the fact you can start over completely. For me that is a big plus. So there's a lot you can control. The interface is user-friendly and the information and guidance is also there. I don't make any use of existing plans and I think it also is lacking in that area. Anything food/ plans related I am not really excited about in this app.,4
8071,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Update, I was using the app incorrectly and the app developers explained how to access all the different articles, thankyou. My inly gripe, and it isnt really a problem, but Id like to set my fast to 21/22/23 even 24 hours. The highest the set plans are 20. But it still records no matter how long you go, Id just like somedays to set it for longer than 20. There are however autograoghy plans to use.",4
8072,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Coming from Zero and only one day on this app it is quite tough to judge just yet. The pay version is certainly better but about the same as the free version of Zero for a comparison. Love that it integrates with Google Fit which is why I switched.,4
8073,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Is it intentional to have a full minute long video ad playing right when you open the app? Seems like a bit much. I generally like this app, have paid for premium in the past. But a full minute ad on every open will cause me to delete.",4
8074,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Its good and it's keeping track of my eating schedule, but it's annoying with the premium, because there's something's that I want to look at but I can't because u have to pay for premium to look at certain things.... But other than that it's really good and I have lost more weight in 4 months than I have in 4 years and for me that's a record. I started at 192.8lbs on September 4th 2023 and now I'm 168.9lbs on December 12th 2023 that is a total of 23.9lbs lost in only 4 months. I'm 14/girl btw.",4
8075,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Great app but a bit annoying due to adds. I wish there was a cheaper paid version for those who don't need all features.,4
8076,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Thank you for not forcing me to pay for stuff!! You're really helpful! I've been looking for wellness apps that can help me but not force me to pay a subscription.,4
8077,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,i wish there was a way for the diet timer to start and stop manually cuz i always stop eating way earlier than the 4 hours and having to do it each time just keeps making me more conscious of eating in general,4
8078,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I'm just doing the basic free version and it keeps me on track with accountability. Can't ask for more than that, as it helps me form my own habits rather than pushing sole responsibility and necessary reliance on the app itself.",4
8079,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Easy to use. Very informative. Only con it uses the battery a little too much,4
8080,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I have always done IF but this app helps me to keep track of details and helps to remind me to drink; what the difference is between physical hunger vs emotional eating, and helpful hints. I like the recipes too but would like to see more quick and easy vegetarian and vegan recipes in metric measurements too - a big wish list, 😆 At these prices a little upgrade would be lovely! There's always room for improvement. :)",4
8081,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"It's a very nice app, the only problem is that we can't access many things when we don't get premium.",4
8082,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Would love to see a fasting app that is compatible with Google smart watches so I can see my fasting timer quickly,4
8083,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I liked the app very much, just one thing needs to change is that we need a option to edit the End time of our fast! Edit: latest version just fixed this issue. Now this app is perfect. I love the interface, specifically the dark mode! The way it displays level and all the information is also very interesting. 100% recommended :) Edit: This app is not giving me any notifications. Usually it use to notify when it's time to end the fast. I don't want to uninstall then re install the app.",4
8084,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Free version is best I've seen, great UI and simple intuitive functionality. Only drawback is that custom setting option for fasting cycle does not give the option to set both start and end times. I can't see that the paid for premium version gives you this either. If it did, then this is all the fasting app you'll ever need. Edit: subsequently cancelled my sub. Custom function doest work, no additional features or fasting option s unlocked, and no reply to my email queries. Waste of ££",4
8085,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"It's a decent app , cheers you up for your achievements and keeps track of your entries, weight and water intake, offers useful information. One thing that helped and motivated me is a little icon at the top of my screen that let's you know the app is tracking your progress. Unfortunately, it would often randomly disappear, confused my brain and I'd forget to enter start and finish time. I wish it would be more consistent especially for beginners as they do better with reminders",4
8086,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I like this app. Easy to use and has good notifications and alerts. However, I don't like how you have to manually stop your fasting time. It goes into ""exceeding"" time, when it should automatically stop and start like other apps do. 10 Nov - response to developer. I've done as you have mentioned but it still just goes into ""exceeding time"" nothing is automatic, no matter what plan I try.",4
8087,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Really easy. Kinda wish it had an alarm to remind me when to start. It does if I pre program a start time but if I forget entirely it doesn't help. Also wish all reading material was available without having to pay for a subscription. I understand having a subscription for programs being personalized but not to access learning materials for beginners.,4
8088,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Well thought out, but..... 1: it would be nice if there is an option to start fasting automatically after certain eating period has elapsed so that I don't have to start it manually every time. ( easily what i mean is to set an automatic time to start the next fasting period) 2: 😊🙂 am happy with the UI/UX, well implemented... Less ads please.",4
8089,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I love this app. It's the reason I keep fasting and I had few cheat days in ~2 months. But it bothers me that my device cannot receive proper notifications (except the water intake one) until I turn the notifications bar on. The notifications bar is too big, the icon stays in the status bar also, it kinda makes the interface busy. Once this is fixed I will be back with the 5*, but overall this is a great app and thank you for doing such a great job!",4
8090,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Fantastic app, the only complaint I have is everyday it switches from ml to fl oz on the water counter. End up adding water drunk with the wrong measurement when I click the water notification, switching it back to ml and because the two units don't translate accurately, my water counter is off slightly. It's a minor issue though. Otherwise, it's an easy to use, great looking app with plenty of interesting facts and tips about fasting.",4
8091,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Updated>> Thanks for the response from the dev :) That backup feature will complete this app for sure and I shall look out for it! Original review>> No data backup. This is a great app, nice graphics and features, thanks for the dark mode also! However there seems to be no facility to export data to a file or to Google Drive etc. What happens if we have to reset our phones, or phones get lost? We will lose months and months of data. Hope this will be implemented in a future version thank you.",4
8092,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Edit: Devs fixed the premium issue quickly. After trying most of the fasting apps, I chose this for the sticky notification, even if I would like it to be in the standard android style and light. I feel for this to be perfect it would need cloud data saving and body measurements tracking, still I recommend it to all who need to keep things under control at all times.",4
8093,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I like how this app gives you information about each fasting stage. I don't like that the eating period doesn't have a timer similar to the fasting period. A feature that would be nice to have, is to allow me to decide the time that I would like to eat, and then the app calculates the time I should start fasting (according to my plan 18-6, 16-8, etc).",4
8094,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I love everything about this app except one thing... I can't set up my 72hr fast(for example) with a start and end time visible and counting both up and down with percentage complete/left. That's it... I really need to see both as part of motivation on a long fast. I would up grade, but currently running other apps in tandum now to see if I can have that as well as useful stats and easy interface and reporting provided here.",4
8095,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"It's so easy to use and very customizable and have some sense of achievement rewards that makes me want to continue fasting. I also love that they incorporated the water tracker inside the app as well rather than having a seperate app for it, as a person struggling with drinking alot of water, this is really helpful to me. I'd love to see some daily pop up tips related to fasting. Keep up the good work",4
8096,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I've d/l this app a couple of times. Decided to recommit to myself & paid for the year. And I love it so far! The only thing that I can see that it's missing, is some sort of exercise/activity tracker. I'd like to be able to record how much/long/far I've walked/day/week or month for example or punch in how long I strength trained for etc... That'd be great if that could be added at some point. Thank you!",4
8097,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"It's pretty straight forward and easy to use, if you are used to fasting it's easy to set on the free mode, but if you are new to fasting you need to pay for premium.",4
8098,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,App is good but needs an update. One major problem is I stopped fasting a few months back and didn't end the fast on the app. You can only edit a fast within the last 2 weeks. So now it says my longest fast is something like 1700 hours. Had to reset all data to clear it and start a fresh Other than the above its a very good app,4
8099,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Great app, really enjoying the experience so far. I love seeing what state of fasting you are in, although I think it would be a great if it provided a few different facts and benefits (on top of what's available already) of whatever state you are currently in. It would be great if there were extra slots for saving more than one water quantity value and logs of when you last drank too. Other than that, great work guys 😉👌.",4
8100,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Good app,4
8101,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"This app has both free and a paid version. I can only speak for the free version, as that is what I use. The app is easy to navigate, shows days and hours fasted, and days you did not fast. I like that you can input your measurements, but it is not a requirement to use the app. There is bite-sized information throughout the app. I find that useful. Unfortunately, you don't get to see all the info without a paid version. But I'm ok with that.",4

8123,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I use the app as a glorified timer for tracking when I fast.,4
8124,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I really love this app. One thing that stops it from getting 5 stars is the fact that there is no calendar layout to see the fasted days. Instead there is only the option to see the timeline. I think having a calendar-like monthly layout with green dots on fasted days and the number of hours inside the dots will dramatically enhance the user-experience. It will give the user a more frienndly and holistic view of his fasting experience throughout an extended period of time.,4

8196,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,A lot of ads.,4
8197,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Annoying ads, but very good app overall",4
8198,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,It's a very good app and helped me alot,4
8199,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"So far, it's great",4
8200,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I love this program! It is the first that I feel I have some control of and just re-learning something as simple as not eating all hours because I can is freeing. I like the simple classic menu plan, it gives me a better/healthier view of what to eat and how much and because it's simple, I can change or add things a little at a time or revert back to the simple original plan.. Fasting has been the easiest and smartest thing I've started towards a healthier and better me. Thank you",5
8201,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"It's my first time fasting, and it's only been a week and I'm already seeing results. While I have been working on changing my eating habits, I find that fasting has helped me change the way I eat even more (in a positive way). The app itself works nicely and ads aren't obstructive or annoying. I love the little achievements since it encourages me to focus on my goals and strive further each time. Overall, highly recommended.",5
8202,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Free version is good, but I paid for the premium and am not disappointed. It's inexpensive & has a simple user interface. I didn't want anything too complicated and this is perfect. I like how you can adjust your start and end times if you forgot to set them right away. I'm fairly new with the app, so if I have anything more, I'll come back & update my review.",5
8203,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Has been an exceptional fasting app so far! Easy interface to work with. Very simple! Love the water tracking, weight tracking, and body measurements tracking features. I love the fasting timer, which is always running in the background. This is what is keeping me on track!",5
8204,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Easy to understand app. Great companion to my weight loss journey. I had been using another app, but it was $30.99 a month. I found this one to be astonishingly well priced for all of its features! In fact, I spent less than half of the previous month's cost of my other app for the entire YEAR! I hope it goes well for the rest of the time, but so far, so good.",5
8205,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I love this app. It has all Kong's of articles that explain everything you could want to know about IF. You can change the time to record when you last ate, to track when your fast starts and stops. I have tried IF before with no success because I would just keep eating/snacking. This motivates me, and I have not cheated since I started tracking myself with the app.",5
8206,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I haven't had it for very long, but the experience so far has been great. It has no age limits, and it does have a subscription but it's fairly cheap (10$ monthly). Not only can you track fasting and the app will tell you when you can stop for optimal fat burn, but it also gives you tons of recipes, insights, and advice.",5
8207,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Loved the app for the most part. Simple, easy to use, and kept me motivated. My main reason to get this app was to examine if IF would make any difference for me. I used the app to keep track and was able to fast 20+ hours for 6 consecutive weeks. Unfortunately it made no difference in my weight, looks, other measurements, or mental clarity (on low carb during feeding times). Not a fault of the app 🙂, but I did delete it since I am no longer motivated to use it.",5
8208,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Ok I love this app..have lost 35 lbs since I started using it. Intuitive GUI, very configurable. I have just one issue..I recently updated to pro and under the section that lists pro features it shows that you should be able to skip a day somehow except I can't find it anywhere..today is Christmas...I wanted to skip fasting for today but...can't find whatever it is that is supposed to allow for it.",5
8209,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I really like the app, it's exactly what I was looking for. It says pay 2.99 for ad removal, but honestly I haven't experienced any ads, besides a very rare one up top. My only complaint would be the subscription, I would pay for it if it was a one time purchase, but I'm not interested in getting a subscription to an app, sorry! 5 stars anyway because the free material does it's job.",5
8210,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"It's an easy app. to use, I have the free version, which comes with ads but you get what you pay or don't pay for. The ads are less than a minute, easy to exist and I get the basics of what I want, to track my water and fasting time so I know exactly when to break my fast or start. Every day is different, especially with work, the app. does the time for me. Can't ask for more, it's exactly what I wanted but it has more features if you're looking for more, it may cost you and that's normal.",5
8211,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I like this app because it has the persistent notification that tells me how long I've been fasting, as well as tells me [an estimation] of what's going on in my body. It really encourages me to push just a little longer and hold out! I like that it's not overly bulky, doesn't have a ton of confusing features; it does what it's meant to do and it's aesthetically pleasing. One thing I would like to see is an optional water reminder, and another nice thing would be weekly/monthly progress.",5
8212,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"As simple as it gets. Right to the point. If you want something that will keep you accountable, or even just to keep you from slipping up and forgetting to stay on track, this is great. The notification stays present in the top bar with a timer so you aren't opening the app to check ever so often. Has some great looking recipes and water intake tracking too. I'm going to utilize as much as possible. For a complete newbie, this app is perfect. Time will tell how it's recommendations work for me.",5
8213,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I've been using this for 3 weeks now without premium and do like the options of various intermittent fasting including a customizable option. Its simple and it reminds me to drink water, and you can see how long you've been fasting without entering into the app (as long as you don't block the notifications). On a more personal note, I've been using the 20:4 ratio (20 hrs not eating and 4 hrs eating) to which I only have 1 meal aka portioned and healthy lunch. I lost about 3 to 5lbs.",5
8214,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I've been using this app for 41 days straight and I love it! The notifications are just enough without being too much, the informational messages about fasting stages and tips are great, the devs are constantly pushing out new features (addition of water tracking is awesome! I've been tracking in the Samsung app and using two apps is a hassle). I definitely don't need more things standing between me and being successful with fasting, and this app makes it very simple to stay on track. Thank you!",5
8215,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Really nice app design and pleasing interface. Ads are not too overwhelming even though I'd prefer no user interruption. Would love to see a changing widget in the status bar (the icon next to the clock on the top left side of the screen) but it's unfortunately static so you have to open the app to check the progress. Also, in the main page, having countdown to mealtime is more important to me than how long I've been fasting. Maybe have an option to toggle between the two. Thanks!",5
8216,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Very easy to use app. Has lots of cool features. I bought the premium plan cause it's cheap, has a little more fasting plans, and Def don't like ads. But, if you go the free route, this app is still great to use. Had no issues or crashes, and the fasting times and dates are highly customizable. It even syncs with Google fit of you want. What I really like it the levels of fasting it shows you're at. Kinda reminds me of a game, where it's you versus the clock to get to the next level.",5
8217,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Just started yesterday. It's not a life changing app., but it's persistently in my face about my timeline and offers more options if you want to upgrade. I'll give it some time, possibly upgrade. The app is nice in the way it gets you to think about what and when you're eating. I might try the water reminder in a couple days. Not a ton of info in free mode and ads as usual with free apps. Ultimately it's your choice but nice motivation if you have a reminder and tracking.",5
8218,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Thumbs up. Upgraded immediately since I knew ads would deter me. No regrets. Still testing various plans, but very happy with this app so far and recommend to others. Feedback for improvement: (1) a widget option that shows eating/fasting timer with fasting state, and (2) add an ""insight"" that describes the process of autophagy and its benefits/risks.",5
8219,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Great for my needs, which is a custom fasting plan, meaning that I don't have to choose specific windows for eating and fasting on the daily. Most helpful to me is the activity levels based upon hours fasting, which explains what's going on in my body; it really encourages me to push harder to get to a higher level of healing. It's not all about weight loss. Easy to access link on notification bar let's me see how many hours I've either fasted or have been in my eating window. I recommend!",5
8220,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I NEVER rate apps... But, for this one I'll break my rule. Just started using it and it's awesome. It's like having a buddy to help you stay encouraged and hitting your goals. The tips are useful, the interface is easy to use, and the tracking features help keep you motivated because you see results over time. I paid for the year and that's the best way to go in my opinion. I'd have spent at least that much on one good meal so why not for a year of ad free support? And paid really is ad free!",5
8221,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"42 days in and I couldn't imagine being without it. After a very brief learning curve, it's been very user friendly and intuitive to navigate. I've found that with using MyFitnessPal to help manage meal plans, I now have a winning combination. 16-8 seems to be the plan that works for me, but the app is flexible enough that the it often turns into 18 hour daily fasts, with occasional 40 hour stretches. The meal suggestions are worthless, but the water tracker is outstanding.",5
8222,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Great app that is simple to track intermittent fasting. I wanted something simple that just tracked my times of fasting. I like that it has limited choices and doesn't alarm constantly trying to track other things. They offer a more in-depth plan and fasting options but I do not feel that I need those resources. I like that it has those options for individuals that are new to fasting. There reference to where you are in the fast allows beginners a better understanding. Overall good app!,5
8223,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"This was the second fasting app I installed, and the one I've stuck with. It's convenient, easy to track, and has most of the features I'm looking for. Previously I gave 5 stars because it seemed to be missing actual start and stop times in the history. But the feature is there, I just missed it. User interface could be improved to make that more obvious. It's a great app and works offline too. This is likely the fasting tracker I will stick with.",5
8224,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"UPDATE: 9 days in and have officially lost 10 pounds. It wasn't perfect, so I probably could have lost more BUT relearning how and when to eat is a process. The process is made WAY easier with this app. Try it. If you fail, KEEP trying until it sticks. You got this! ********* So far, so good. Just started two days ago. Testing out the free version. I'll circle back in 4 weeks and update progress and see if I want to upgrade.",5
8225,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Love this App. Free version is great. I don't mind the ads, they are not bothersome. Recording and editing your fasting times is easy. Editing is needed if you know when to start eating and you forget to record it. It keeps me on track. Also the gentle water drinking reminders are very helpful. Since I work at a desk all day, I have to be reminded to keep drinking. So happy. If I don't like an app, it will be deleted after a few days. Great job! Weight loss is easy with this.",5
8226,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I've tried several other IF apps, but this one actually does exactly what I want. In my phone notifications, I can easily see if I'm fasting or eating and how much time is left. It also gives reminders to drink water. There is some customization available (times, reminder frequency, etc.). It's got an easy interface. Overall, I highly recommend.",5
8227,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I have tried all of the top fasting apps on the Play Store and this is by far the best! I love the pinned notification and how easy it is to modify the start/end time of a fast. Some features that I'd love to have would be a visual widget for the fast (like the tracker shown on the Fasting page), along with a visual time tracker in the pinned notification. Being able to visualize how long you have left in the fast without having to check the app would be awesome. Thanks for reading!",5
8228,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Don't miss out! Great app to keep you on schedule for intermittent fasting or any fasting you want (with the paid version). In free version, ads are minimal and can be closed after 5 seconds. Lots of recommendations, helpful tips, explanations what your body goes through. I've been on it for 1 week and I feel less bloated than I have the last 3 years. Thank you!!!",5
8229,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Very intuitive interface that guides you through the fasting process while providing enough options to be flexible but not overwhelming. The insights are plentiful, informative, and well written. I'd suggest they add more meals to the diet plan. Only having two breakfast options is a placeholder, not usable content. Overall very happy with the app and my fasting results.",5
8230,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Final ingredient I needed. It was confusing for me at sign up to see that this is a free app with all the initial premium plans flashing. Bypass those and jump to the free aspects which have been enough for me. Able to keep an eye on the time without fretting every other hour. My hunger is curbed by being able to focus on life and drinking more water, the clock lets me know when to stop the fast. Simple. Options for beginner and levels above.",5
8231,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"The app definitely keeps me on track. I like reading the description of the various stages I'm in while fasting. I haven't found the ads to be very intrusive at all. However, as others have said, for some reason I can't modify a custom fasting time to an earlier time today, only yesterday or earlier, which causes me to lose records of my fasts. Hope this bug gets fixed soon! **Update - they fixed this bug so I'm changing my review to 5 stars!",5
8232,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Does the job. Tracks fasting, weight, and provides useful information. Perfect! I have been trying to lose weight for the last 3 years and I'd lose and regain, never getting to my ideal weight. Using this app to track my intermittent fasting, I've finally lost those last 11 pounds. I'm thrilled!! Clothes fit again! Favorite features? The fasting timer both till fasting starts and till fasting ends. I would pay a one time app fee, but not a subscription for premium. Wish they would change that.",5
8233,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"This app is simply amazing! It really keeps up my motivation and helps track everything important. I love how it's customizable to your own choices to help you ease in. I've already lost 10 pounds using this app! It does take time and a lot of effort but this app really gives you all the information that you need and more. You can track more than your weight but also do measurements, track water intake, and even shows your BMI score. Love it",5
8234,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,The app is simple to use and gives info about each fasting stage so the user can understand what is happening to the body at different times during the process. At a glance the app shows what percentage of fasting is being completed for the day. And I like the reward plaques that mark progress when goals are completed. I am so happy that I found this app for tracking my interval fasting schedule. The app has never crashed and it works well on my Android.,5
8235,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I have lost weight and i just feel better eating less often. The app is informative and encouraging. Understanding what's happening is helpful and i don't have to worry I forgot when the fast ends. It stops my evening snacking. *The developers are very responsive and helpful. I do wish there was a log in of some sort. I am on my third phone and I have to start over and lose stats and records every time. I can't even transfer phone to phone.,5
8236,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Great App; Great Tool I'm not a fasting kind of guy. Mainly it was due to not knowing much about it, and the benefits from it. Making something new like this a habit of difficult. This app tracks your fasting schedule, no matter how beginner or advanced. Plus, it tells you what your body is going through hour by hour which helps keep your will from unwavering, for me at least. I highly recommend to anyone starting a fasting schedule!",5
8237,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"i think the app is pretty good. the features are simple, but i think that's a good thing, considering its primary goal. you can set custom fasting timers, change the time you started and ended if you forgot to end your fast before eating. it has some helpful tips, you can track your water. i think this app serves as a great supplement to apps like my fitness pal and bublup.",5
8238,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"The app works well from a technical standpoint, has a nice and clean design, gives easy to follow instructions, and most importantly (in my opinion) is a shining model of what the free version of a paid app should look like. The ads are present but not exhausting and constant, and while paying for premium would certainly unlock some nice functions within the app, the free version is more than usable. It's a good balance; one that feels respectful to users.",5
8239,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Tracks my fast in a simple, straight forward way. I like the learning aspect of what happens to my body during my fast. It's easy to choose which fast to start, when the feeding window occurs, plus the edit option is a nice feature too. I've had no problems with this app which I would highly recommend to anyone interested in intermittent fasting (IF).",5
8240,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"It's very simple. You input your info and decide which plan you want. It then warns you an hour before your fast startsand an hour before it ends. When you are fasting it tells you what stage you are in, which is nice, but the info never changes. It tracks your lifetime fasting time, has a weekly tracker showing how much you've fasted. Very simple, but nice. No annoying ads or push to buy or upgrade. Attractive app and easy to navigate.",5
8241,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Very useful and understandable. It does have ads, but they are not that frequent. The app has a lot of interesting topics, knowledge and tips for free. I like the fact that if you missed to clock in or out of the fasting period, you can go back and change it. I also like the water reminder: you can use it in oz. (I understand oz better), you can schedule the reminder for every certain minutes to hours.",5
8242,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"This is the best fasting app I've tried so far. It has enough good features, but not overloaded like some are My only complaint is that I found it virtually impossible to use the free version. I could not do a thing with it without being constantly nagged to buy the pro version, which was disappointing and very annoying. But fortunately, the price was reasonable compared to some others. Regardless I rate it 5 stars because it's easy to use once you get past that. Helps a lot with IF!",5
8243,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I love this app. However, I have only used it for about 2 weeks now and twice it has reset me back to my first day of fasting. It still shows all the days I fasted but it says I'm on day one again. This is a little frustrating when you're trying to look at your overall achievement. Mentally I know how hard I've been working but it's still nice to see. The app is very helpful in keeping me on track. Just wish it wouldn't keep restarting my progress. *Update* Issue fixed!",5
8244,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"This app is working great for me so far. I really like the interface and the reminders. It is really helping me keep track of when I can eat next. Before finding this app, I lost track of when I had last eaten surprisingly easy. It's also great having a visual reminder of how long I have remaining in a fast. The coolest feature is the display of what stage of fasting you're currently in and what's happening in your body during those hours. Super motivating!",5
8245,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"My favorite fasting app so far, after trying three or four others. The free version has great features and the ads are not in-your-face. I think an option to record body fat percentage would be nice for those of us who might consider that data useful. Better still would be if you could sync body fat percentage data with Google Fit. Overall, however, I am enjoying using the app and seeing my stats over time. It really helps keep me motivated to lose the weight I've gained over the years.",5
8246,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Exactly what I needed from an intermittent fasting app. My schedules are somewhat inconsistent so having this tool to confirm my window is perfect. Very nice touch to break down each phase of the fast and what is happening/expected of one's body during each level of the fast. Truly makes it simple for anyone to follow and understand the benefits that come from fasting (the general opinion from most people seems to be negative.) Excellent tool for those looking to cut, detox, or lose weight.",5
8247,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Seriously just what I needed to stay motivated for this journey. It's awesome, no random adds, no annoying pop-ups, free, and they keep it simple. I have been trying to fast for many months but kept letting my self down and giving into my food and beverage cravings. The main thing is that they break down what's going on inside of your body on a scientific level at certain periods during the fast, examples , blood sugar levels , ketosis , fat burning mode, growth hormone and autophagy.",5
8248,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I am so pleased with this App!!!😁👍 I can tell the creator(s) are well educated and this App literally takes you by the hand and guides you with science,knowledge,and easy-to-use manageable programs. I consulted with my Dr.1st. I recommend one does the same. It tells you every step of the way what your body is doing the physiological break down of what is happening at every interval. Has excellent reminders and a plan for everyone. You can even customize. Literally no bugging ads. Thank you!",5
8249,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Other than an occasional ad, I have no complaints. I was able to input my height, weight, goal weight, and body measurements to monitor progress. It has some good eating deterrents to prevent emotional eating and other things that come with free use. With a push of a button you start your fasting timer and the timer alerts you when you have met the daily fasting time. The time will keep running until you have signaled that you have broken the fast. I recommend the app. Easy to use and help",5
8250,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Basic app that keeps track of your fasting. I did not pay for premium because there isn't really anything extra except advice & recipes. It has clear graphics & you can set up reminders for when to start, when to stop & your water intake. You can track your weight to see how you're doing. It's very convenient because we all need a little help & just having this on your phone to check times makes it so easy to stay on top of it. You can adjust your stop & start time, even adjust past durations",5
8251,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"there is something about this app that I have difficulty putting into words....i had it on my phone for a long while never using and then when I was cleaning up my apps. I saw it decided to give it a try. what I enjoy and like is that there is a constant ""timer"" function that pops up in my alerts...so everytime I check a text or see what alert popped up. I get to see my progress and time fasting. I can't explain the why. all I can say is I'm now 9days in for fasting and looking to increase",5

Whether I succeed in my goal or fall short, this app already has won and succeeded in my opinion!",5
8253,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"This app tracks fasting, and not much else. It does what it was designed to do, and I like it. I could keep track of fasting times myself, but with this app, I don't have to. It also gives pointers, suggests different plans and the merits of each. As an IF newbie, I appreciate the support I get from this app. Even though diets generally don't work for me, I've steadily lost about 1.3 pounds per week over the last month, and I feel wonderful.",5
8254,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I'm already pretty experienced at fasting but wanted an app that would time it and explain what was happening to my body during the different stages. I was most interested in autophagy for my immune disease. This app has everything I need to keep track of my fasts and encourages me to keep going. It's also very easy to use and has lots of extra info to educate yourself about the benefits of fasting.,5
8255,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,This is my go to app. I got the paid version bc I hate ads AND a years subscription is extremely reasonable. I've been using the app to start my intermittent fasting journey. It has taken about 3 weeks to adjust. I started out too fast but dialed it back using the suggested methods for beginners. It's not just the fasting but it's what you eat as well. I still enjoy good food but in moderation. I use Lose It to keep me honest on caloric intake during my eating window. Make a commitment.,5
8256,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"This is the best IF app I have tried. It has weekly programs for those on a regular schedule, but it also has daily tracking for those of us who work odd shifts, to help with days off, etc. I can click the start fasting button after my final meal of the day and the app informs me when my fast has reached my set time. I usually set a 16 hour interval, but if I decide to keep fasting, the app tracks my actual time. /edit: update fixed my issue with adjusting end times. Great customer service!",5
8257,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"First off, I have tried Intermittent Fasting before, but was obsessed with *ugh, I can't eat right now!* Something changed IN ME, and I was ready to *really* do it. That's an important precursor to this review, bc I don't think any app could have helped create that internal change *for* me. That said, LOVE this app. Love the way it presents information in bite-sized doses in a ""story-swipe"" style. The images are pleasing to me, and the app tracks useful data for me. So easy to use. A great tool!",5
8258,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Great fasting app for intermittent fasting which is new to me. Very easy to use. My only complaint or recommendation for changing within the application would be the custom fasting option. It would be nice to actually set start and end times or create a custom fasting plan that may involve multiple start and end times within a day. Otherwise very easy to use and it's a good application.,5
8259,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Very User Friendly & Informative Intermittent Fasting App for everyone, from people who have not heard of IF, to longtime IF practitioners. I've just started my journey, but already feel like I know so much about the benefits, pitfalls, side effects, and more, all because of the info and help from this app. It also helps you keep your water intake goal, which helps curb hunger. Highly recommend to lose weight, or just develop healthier behaviors. It's so easy to use & track your progress.",5

I mean you could make it more robust to cover other aspects of a weight/fitness management regimen... Not sure it is necessary to make a competitor to other dairies of food intake, and fitness workouts. I think the Fasting App does as anyone would want concerning fasting. It offers you presets to use, and the times of your fast can be started and stopped at the true point in time. The App does it and very well.",5
8263,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"This is the best app for intermittent fasting. I installed and uninstalled FIVE fasting apps before this one. For the free version it has minimal ads&is perfect for a basic fasting program. The upgrade is perfect for fine tuning the fasting experience with healthy & nutrient dense meals for the eating periods. However, there is no pressure to upgrade like the other fasting apps making it impossible to use the free program. Those apps are greedy because they already make $$$ from the ads.",5
8264,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I love the fact that it tracks literally every step of your progress while you're fasting, and also that there is an option for the app to notify you to drink water on a timed interval. Both of those features alone make this app worth it, and there are at least a dozen more I could mention that only add to how much of a terrific time I'm having using it. It can track your goals, your progress, your lapses, everything. Truly the best app for intermittent fasting, at least the best one I've found.",5
8265,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Going into month three, I see the power of this. I have tried and succeeded fasting only for a few weeks at a time, quitting and starting and eventually failing because I wasn't keeping good track of the changes after the first few weeks. And since the major/fast drop in weight is only in the first month, i never really noticed the weight drop afterwards and would quit. But keeping track with this app has been very motivational. Thank u.",5
8266,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Down 7lbs in a Month! I find that I snack a good bit at night. I downloaded this with zero research almost and decided to do the 18-6 plan. I've lost 7lbs in a month which is mind blowing. My relationship with food is better and I have more energy. I get hangry sometimes but I'm losing weight and not having to change much else. Thank you developers! This has been an easy way to control my food intake in a more responsible way.,5
8267,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I downloaded this app several days ago and bought the premium pass (which was 60% off at the time) to get the perks. So far, I really enjoy it! They have daily food suggestions, which are very helpful, tips, and the app is easy to navigate. I've only been on it for 4 days, and I've lost 3 lbs! I'm eating right, drinking lots of water, feeling great, and finally losing weight!",5
8268,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"This app has working very well for me. It is easier to use than the rest, gives what you need. It is helping keep track of not just my progress, but my fasting and eating times. Even without the subscription you get a lot of great advice and helpful hints without a ton of ads. I did figure out how to pay to get rid of ads. Once I figure out how to get rid of the subscription stuff (which I can't stand that everybody does) I will pay for a year to access more helpful hints and features.",5
8269,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Really helpful- the information on each stage helps keep you motivated. I set an alarm for ketosis and plan workouts around it, now, so I'm burning more fat for the same activity just by understanding where my blood sugar is and what my body is running on at the time. That used to be a guess at best. Pretty cool, and I'm just using the free version. Simple and useful, 5 stars. I want to mention the lack of samsung health or Google fit, but not sure what integration would do... I'm ok without it.",5
8270,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I've done intermittent and multi day fasting. But lately was falling out if schedule, even with one meal a day (OMAD) . The Fasting APP was exactly the right interface to get me back in track and make it easy. With water intake tracking and reminders, plus educational and motivational segways, it makes sticking to the plan extremely easy, especially for those of us with hectic days and can't keep track of the time.",5
8271,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"UPDATE: I upgraded to PREMIUM and have been using this app for about 8 months. I've lost 20 lbs and still going strong! I do take time off and eat sweets a lil more than I should, but fasting works! 1st review: So far, this app is great! I want to use it a little longer before committing to premium, but it's pretty awesome. It has tips and tons of info about how you burn fat and lose weight and even has a widget that reminds you to drink water. I've actually lost 7 lbs! Thanks Fasting App!",5
8272,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Just the basic is pretty much all you need but the paid versions are very reasonable subscriptions. Great preplanned fasts, customize option, water intake monitor, compatible with Google Fit - only thing else I'd like to have with it is a step counter/exercise log, and something for logging sleep (without syncing to anything). But as it's it's pretty amazing.",5
8273,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"This is exactly what I was looking for: a simple timer with a persistent notification bar so I can always see where I'm at in the fasting process. I tried a similar app before, but this one is so much easier to use. I like how you can quickly switch between elapsed time and remaining time and also easily edit the start and end times. I keep notifications turned off for most apps, but I find the water reminders are actually helpful.",5
8274,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Really like this app. No intrusive ads! It has really helped me to keep track and keep me accountable. The water reminders are very helpful! Somtimes, I do forget to drink water !? I used the app once before and after some time, thought I could manage my fasting times on my own. Eventually, forgot when I stopped eating and when to start fasting so I stopped altogether. Tried a similar app but I didn't like it. Came back to this app and still on track!",5
8275,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"The overall rating of this app should tell all. Smooth UI, great information packed into it for meal preps, what you can drink and can't, what types of foods you should eat and avoid during your non-fasting period. It's got a water tracker, and lots of notifications to use so you won't ever have to worry about forgetting when your fasting time starts and stops. It's overall the best fasting app I've tried, and I encourage anyone else on this journey to try it as well!",5
8276,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I haven't been using this long, but it's really nice to be able to follow every few hours' progress, to track just what is happening in my body and the benefits of each consecutive process. I love the Insights provided and the tips on how to get the most out of this app and fasting. I like the type of hunger test. You can track your water, your weight, and more specifically your sizes in chest, waist, thigh, and hips. That'll be convenient reference the next time I might order clothes online!",5
8277,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Very easy to use. Very user friendly. I love how you can not only monitor your fasting but I love how you can amend the times. Sometimes I forget to start the app immediately when I begin to fast. However, the app allows you to manually input your start time. It also reminds you, to see if you're still fasting after longer period of time. I especially enjoy how the app awards you badges and congratulates you after achieving various goals. It sounds a little childish, but it seems to work! 5*",5
8278,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I started out giving Fasting Tracker a 3 because I couldn't figure out how to edit my fasting time frames. The tech support crew saw my review and squared me away. The tools were there, I just didn't see them. I'm in my 60s so that explains that. Either way, I'm useing Fasting Tracker all day everyday, I was already an intermittent faster but now my fasting is consistent and I feel like I'm getting somewhere because I can better track my progress.",5
8279,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Great app. Really helps when fasting. Keeping track of time is great, but also a reminder not to snack. The alerts to drink liquids helps keep hunger at bat, and keep you hydrated. And I like the fasting info that tells you what benefits your body is getting, depending on how far you are into your fast. I think motivational notifications that tell you you are doing well, and at what phase your body is in and the benefits would help mentally and be kinda cool. But the app is very insightful.",5
8280,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I got really lucky as this was the first fasting app I chose, this app is so handy and multi-faceted. You can track your weight, your water consumption and your fasting all in one place. The hydration reminders are fantastic and have really kept me on track and I love that the reminders are not terribly intrusive. They don't push you to get further upgrades, and are encouraging, I really love it.",5
8281,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,My personal favorite fasting app. The UI is nice. You can custom fast or get inspired by their big selection of premade weekly plans. It gives you an estimate of what's happening to your body during fasting. It has push notifications that remind you to fast and drink water. You can also track your weight and sync it with Google fit. I also like all of the little informative articles. 👍 Suggestion: It would be cool to have a calendar view where I can make my own custom fasting plans.,5
8282,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I like being able to set my eating window. The timer that shows on my lock screen is awesome when I just need to see but dont want to open my phone (at work, in a meeting, when staring down a plate of doughnuts in the break room). The halfway there reminder is uplifting. More encouraging messages from the app would be nice however, especially on harder days. It's simple and easy to use.",5
8283,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"This app was a very informative guide. I paid for the first year so I wouldn't have ads and would have full access to the ""insights"". It helps to have a visual aid to keep you on track. I wanted to fast for the health benefits but I didn't mind losing that last, stubborn 12 pounds for my goal weight! Now, I continue to fast for weight maintenance and the health benefits.",5
8284,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"The Fasting app is an excellent tool for individuals looking to incorporate intermittent fasting into their lifestyle. This app has a simple, user-friendly interface, making it easy for individuals to navigate and use. The app provides several different types of fasting schedules to choose from, including time-restricted feeding, alternate day fasting, and extended fasting. One of the most significant advantages of this app is the informative content that it offers. The app provides articles!",5
8285,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,I have always had an issue with my weight and have tried countless diets always failing in the end. I would lose weight but always seemed to put it back on time and time again. I heard about intermittent fasting and researched it very intensely so I looked for an aide to help me achieve my goal. Then I found the Fasting app and I couldn't be happier. I gave it a try and was so impressed that I got the premium package. It offers me everything I need and I am showing so much improvement. Get it.,5
8286,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I downloaded this and another fasting tracker type app, to compare, on the same day. I like the functionality of this one much better & it only took a day for me to uninstall the other one. This is simple to use, but very informative, which I love. I don't even need the premium version, but due to the enjoyment of the app, I may eventually upgrade, just to check out the other features. This is a good one!",5
8287,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I've tried fasting before and have been successful, but I must say when you have a timer on your phone definitely feels a bit more rewarding. No need for the paid version unless you don't want ads, and want the fasting and eating periods to start automatically from the premade fasting options, otherwise the manual (""custom "" in the app) timer will do just fine. Wish they had a 21-3 option though.",5
8288,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"This app is a go to for people who have always wanted to fast, but has been hesitant. It explains every few hours what is happening in your body while you are not fasting, which motivates me to keep going. It comforts you through the process and rewards you when you are done. Very informative and motivational. Ads aren't to frequent or annoying. I have lost 9 pounds in a week with the 16:8 hour fast. Looking forward to keeping this up... Just try it!",5
8289,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"So far so good! I used to use the zero, another fasting app. And this fasting app has alot more to give! I love that it shows what stage I am in my fasting, and i love how you can also put notes about how much water you're drinking, also the reminders to drink water! I have it set up, 7am to 10pm with 1 hour intervals to remind me to drink water. I love that because I need to drink more water! Also for the ads. I see there is an option where you can pay for ads free for 2.99$ so maybe I will do",5
8290,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Daily or weekly tracking. Records body data so you can see what is changing. Insights provided are interesting and helpful for me. I like knowing the benchmark of how my biology is performing at various stages of fasting. I'm older but sticking with my goal. I use some food suggestions but have gone on my own to discover what calories I can guestimate between fruit, vegetables, starches and fats. My eating habits are improved because of foods I like to eat!! Explore!!!",5
8291,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"This app is very beneficial for my intermittent fasting. I've only had this app for maybe a week but it's already become one of my favorite things on my phone. I love the encouraging messages it'll send through the fasting process (""You're halfway there"", ""Keep going"", and such). I haven't even tapped into all of the features yet.",5
8292,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I love this app! It's helped me meet my 1 gallon/day goal each day since starting. I'm down 2 lbs in 4 days. It's low maintenance, I don't have to enter my meals or calories, just my fasting time and track my water! Highly recommend this app if you need help staying on task and don't want to be bothered logging meals, calories, etc. Lots of useful tips too on IF, side effects, weight loss, etc.",5
8293,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I have been using it for about a week can't really complain, I don't really know what the benefits of getting the pro version would be besides less ads and maybe diet information. But for free it's fine. Tracks food and water. Edit: been using the app for about a month and a half. Still love the app the only thing that I'd like to change is that you can't edit the amount of water and it zeros out at midnight. Sometimes I forget to add a water bottle and I can't change it.",5
8294,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I really like being able to refer to the tracker throughout my fast. It helps me stay motivated to hit and surpass my daily goal. It helps you keep track of daily and weekly progress, and gives little tips about what your body is going through during the different phases of your fasting time. I've staying on my planned schedule for the last several days since downloading and have referred back to the app dozens of times each day.",5
8295,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"So far so good. The app is very easy to use, and I really like how during fasting it keeps you motivated by telling you what your body is doing during each time period. The free app is awesome and you won't feel like you're missing too much without paying. I have yet to see an ad.. I plan on paying for a plan not because it is needed (you can absolutely do this with the free app) but I will enjoy what you get with the plan. It will give you a more advanced plan and tell you a lot more. 5 ⭐'s!",5
8296,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Best fasting app I have tried. I love the ""fasting stage"" info status notification on my phone ...as keeps you motivated. Everything is very cleanly organized and simple to use. The only wish I have is it would let you customize a weekly fasting plan from scratch. I do 2x36 hour fasts with 1x24 hour per week. This doesn't match any of their pre designed weekly plans....so I have to just use a custom fast each day....versus being able to plan it ahead in the app. Otherwise, best app!",5
8297,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"This app has honestly helped me with fasting. Having the banner turned on gives me motivation each time I look at my phone and the BEST is seeing what state my body is in and what it means. When it's almost my old eating time, I look at the app, become proud of myself, and just keep hanging on until I am actually ready to eat. Best lifestyle change!!",5
8298,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"I've only had it for a day, but so far so good! I have the free version and while the app makes clear the benefits of having the pay version, the free version is still fully functional and ideal for anyone new to fasting. The app itself is pretty intuitive, and I say that as someone who doesn't use a lot of fitness apps and trackers. Plus the ads aren't obtrusive, which is a pleasant surprise!",5
8299,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"Easy to use, love the reminders, over all my favorite fasting tracker and I've tried many! I'm losing weight just following the 16/8 plan, but I have used custom (still free) to achieve autophagy. I love that at any time you can see what effect fasting is having on your body, the app gives you info based on how long you've been fasting. Can track weight, water, and there are lots of tips and tricks.",5
8300,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,Nice app,5
8301,bodyfast.zero.fastingtracker.weightloss,"This is the best fasting app , i,m currently 12 years old and i,ve been fasting for 48 hours ,and i can feel myself being more happy and i,m also able to concentrate better in class.

Not too bad at that start, but now it's the same 5 recipes for lunch or dinner respectively.  2. Food waste occurred somewhat more frequently as most of the portions are way off (2 red bell peppers and hummus for a SNACK...come on now).  3. I found the pantry system to be neat at first but impossible to maintain after a while. Ingredients don't merge (Soy Sauce and Soy Sauce of different measurements) and often I found my meat was never difficult to maintain as you either buy Frozen and may waste it, or you buy fresh and it goes bad before that day arrives.   Listen, it's a great concept, and I enjoyed my time on the platform, but keep your expectations reasonable and don't assume this will be automated food planning.

It will often generate just an entree at 2 servings for a full meal like lunch or dinner and then another entree at a half portion for a snack? So my lunch or dinner ends up being two full chicken breasts and no sides and my snack is half a chicken breast?

Food waste occurred somewhat more frequently as most of the portions are way off (2 red bell peppers and hummus for a SNACK...come on now).  3. I found the pantry system to be neat at first but impossible to maintain after a while.

Listen, it's a great concept, and I enjoyed my time on the platform, but keep your expectations reasonable and don't assume this will be automated food planning.

I love the groceries list, etc. However the app can be absolutely infuriating. A few times I have managed to swipe and regenerate the meal rather than record ""I ate this"" or move onto the next screen. There should be an undo button at least. I go out and buy ingredients for the week and one slight mis-touch creates an entire new meal with things I don't have.",3

9191,com.eatthismuch,"I was pretty impressed by the free version so went for the free 14 day trial with the intention of subscribing but the app is a bit lacking when generating some meals. It will often only give one aspect of a meal for example for dinner it will have a recipe for fish but won't have any vegetables to go with it. However it will say eat 2 portions of the fish, when in reality it would be better to generate 1 portion of fish and 1 portion of vegetables. I'm sure if this is addressed it will be awesome.",3

Unfortunately, there just weren't enough recipes to support my needs, once my restrictions were entered. I was essentially left with eating popcorn and rice cakes every day.

9201,com.eatthismuch,"Very good service for those who need significant customization in meal planning. There are a lot of settings but many can be put to default or recommended. My only real complaint is that it is too easy to accidentally change things and more difficult to change them back because they don't have an undo, previous, or lock functions. For instance, I bought groceries and then accidentally regenerated a day /meal and couldn't remember what the heck I was supposed to make with my groceries.",4
9202,com.eatthismuch,Love this app! I do wish the scan bar code functionality worked better. It rarely pulls up info when it reads it and if it does its a list of items not the specific one. Also not a wide range of food items when you're trying to add things not on the meal plan. Otherwise its awesome! one of the only apps that allows you to track calories and macros plus cholesterol and sodium levels! Just please improve on the food library to add items and the scan bar code.,4
9203,com.eatthismuch,"I could only do the free trial but I was impressed. One of the biggest issues I have with most meal planners is that I am a very picky eater and I don't like meat or seafood. This app was able to plan around that by letting me list what I don't like. There were great simple recipes. Great ideas on variety. The only issue is that I don't have things like a juicer, blender, etc. Also, when they break down the cost it's per individual serving. I'm on a super tight budget. I still love the app.",4

9206,com.eatthismuch,"Love the app overall, but the new GUI update is terrible. You can no longer regenerate a single dish, only an entire meal, so if you can't find one ingredient, time to replan half your meals, instead of just swapping out the dish.

9209,com.eatthismuch,"The good: Just enter the calories you want to consume in a day and the app gives you a meal plan. Easy-peasy! There are tons of recipes and you can easily switch out any recipes or foods you don't like. The bad: the free version only allows you to create a plan for a single day and won't save your menu. If you want to make a plan for a week (or two) and a grocery list for everything to buy, you need to shell out $8.99 per month for premium, or a discounted $59.99 if you pay for an entire year.",4
9210,com.eatthismuch,"I like how easy it is to navigate. Takes all the hard work out of meal-prepping - mostly thinking about what to cook, which is the thing that takes forever for me. Only thing that would make it a 5 star would be to have it better adjust to meals for multiple people in the household. For example, I cook dinner for both me and my husband so it would be nice if I were able to input his numbers in for that specific meal.

There are a few flaws here and there like the meal suggestions can be weird, and the accuracy of calorie, macronutrient, and cost estimations are questionable.

I mostly make and curate my meal plan on the website and use the app for the grocery list and recipe viewing.

I wish they offered a meal delivery or shopping service to fill weekly recipe items- it may make them a bit more aware of the recipes they load.

I really like the low pressure on the paid content and that I can achieve my goals for a free app. I think if recipe substitutions were offered in the paid portion, that is what would make me subscribe.

There are tons of recipes and you can easily switch out any recipes or foods you don't like. The bad: the free version only allows you to create a plan for a single day and won't save your menu. If you want to make a plan for a week (or two) and a grocery list for everything to buy, you need to shell out $8.99 per month for premium, or a discounted $59.99 if you pay for an entire year.",4

Just subscribed to Premium for the auto-generated grocery lists. Genius!",5

Keep up the good work! I've already saved the cost of this App for a year on groceries in 2 weeks. Just for having the right helper!!",5
9415,com.eatthismuch,I got the upgraded version of the app for 59.99 for the year and was able to plan out my meals for an entire week. Even generated a shopping list. Very easy to use and has helped me on my diet. My one con about it is that it is too easy to switch meals. I did it on accident and couldn't figure out how to get that meal back. I had already planned out my week and had gone shopping. Luckily I figured it out.,5

My only concern is that accidentally pushing one button may lose data of the plan you were following for the week (and groceries you already bought for that plan). I am just careful. I accidentally regenerated a meal once that was not part of my grocerie that I bought so I kept regenerating the meal until the original showed up again.",5
9418,com.eatthismuch,"This is one of the best apps that I've ever used for meal planning. It is so convenient and complete, I highly recommend the premium for its benefits. You can control macros, type of diet, personalize your plan. The app itself is not the most intuitive thing, it is more for a daily basis use - the computer is easier to understand and edit.

I recommend this for anyone that finds it easier to be told exactly what to eat to meet your goals.",5

I'm 25 and eat out every day for dinner, and have the free cereal from work for breakfast. This app changed everything. It's SO insanely easy to plan shopping, so easy to switch out meals you don't like. If you are debating getting this, don't. Start with the premium free trial. Do it. Seriously crying with happiness that there was something out there to cure my laziness 😂",5
9421,com.eatthismuch,"If you want to PLAN MACROS, this is THE APP FOR YOU. I read a few books that espoused following a macronutrient diet. I could not find good spreadsheets or planners. I couldn't find already created plans. I wanted to be able to make my own plans. I did not want to be reactive (tracking), I wanted to be proactive (planning!). After much searching, I stumbled across this app. I tell all my friends about this app. Absolutely love it. 3 months I lost 15 pounds. It is more effort to plan and cook compared to eating frozen foods, cereal and sandwiches, I'll admit that. However, I was NOT hungry. I PLANNED a sustainable (about 20%) calorie deficit, and did not over do-it on exercise (Although I also did quite a bit of training and built up my endurance via programs on my treadmill.) I just received the renewal message from google saying ""we will be billing you soon for the next 1 year"". I'll be subscribing for life at this point. Makes a huge difference. Much less grocery waste. It is a lifestyle. This enables it. Thank you to the creators for making, and continuing to improve the app. As more people use it, we'll get more recipes in the database and clean up the duplicates. It is just a wonderful resource. - John",5

Did you have something for breakfast on the day they generate for you but don't like what lunch is? Just regenerate and it will keep the next meal within your macros! Got leftovers?

9464,com.eatthismuch,"Works really nicely as a planner and I've yet to find anything better or more convenient. The planner likes to pick a sort of limited array of recipes, and the db has duplicates. Items are often added to the grocery list in weird quantities. But these are quibbles, nothing else I've used has a comparable meal planner, or the database of foods. lt's super customizable and controllable, but still easy to use; that's the magic combination. I've used this for months now and the weight loss is real",5
9465,com.eatthismuch,"Excellent, customizable app for understanding what you eat (calories, protein, carbs, fats, nutrients). I'd love ability to export macro/progress data as a .CSV file! Haven't much used its menu/recipe generation function--looks hit-and-miss: sometimes offers great meal plans/recipes, other times odd-looking meal combos. But it'll come up with useful stuff if you hit 'refresh'. I often use substitute products in its food database because it's laborious to enter 'custom' foods (doesn't  recognize Canadian bar codes?). Sometimes ETM food-search function (on web esp.) slows to a crawl... my tech issue? If I log out/in again it seems to resolve. System won't let you create and save a recipe and then reuse it in future plan with minor changes to ingredients, without also altering every prior use of that recipe. Nor can you slightly modify your own recipe with different ingredient/title but keep both versions. To save time/reuse/modify recipe, you can create a long meal menu rather than a recipe, save that day's 'meal plan', and then *import that saved meal plan* into your current day (or a future day, & drag-and-drop items into current meal menu). With workarounds, still a *great* app!",5
9466,com.eatthismuch,"Best app I have every used! It is really great at keep track of calories and planning our family dinners and everything in-between.

You pay a couple of Euros or dollars a month to never have to think about what to eat again? Hell yeah, I'll take it.

Well the data never synced to the cloud so I lost a months worth of heart rates. My appointment with the cardiologist is this week and I have nothing to show them. The syncing should be automatic, I had no way to know my phone would stop working. Really disappointing.",2
9802,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"I am unable to even get measurements with this app. I don't know if it is because my phone has multiple cameras, but the viewing frame turns completely red and yet it still cannot get a reading. The one time I did get a reading, it showed my resting heart rate as 95 bpm... which is highly inaccurate. Not too much of a problem because there is an option for manual inputs, but I wish I could use one app for all of my needs. Over all, the ads are not too bad, and the interface is nice and polished.",2
9803,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Extremely confused. Tested with multiple fingers and while vaping/not vaping while resting to see if the results pointed to a specific method that was the most accurate-they were erratic without cause. At one point I got 125 which I knew was nowhere near my actual pulse. Given, most were 70-80, but it was dropping to the 50s then one minute later going to 125. I would have FELT that rise if it had truly happened but I didn't. It's just inaccurate, but probably the best of what's available.",2
9804,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"It worked great on my previous phone, Xiaomi Mi Note 10. However, it can't seem to detect my pulse on my new Xiaomi 12 pro. This phone has a feature to measure heart rate with the fingerprint sensor though, and I just wanted to test the accuracy and consistency by using this app since I have my suspicions that it isn't always that accurate. I tried positioning my finger in many ways on the camera and it just couldn't pick up my pulse. I booted up my old phone to test and it worked as intended.",2
9805,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Pretty accurate, and the tracker is ok. It would be nice to be able to add a customized note. The thing I hate is the fact that you have to watch an ad right at the beginning. If I'm having tachycardia, I need to check it NOW. The ad would be better placed between checking the heart rate and choosing the activity.",2
9806,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Didn't care for all the pop ups. And I wish you could have the heart rate detection run in real time until the user decides to stop it. It's also very annoying that the app auto loads a chart after each reading. So if I want to take several readings I have to keep clicking back to the measure tab.,2
9807,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Hard to not click on ads, they appear to be put in such a way you think that you are giving the cardio app information, one of those ones where you feel you are being tricked. instead some ad of some kind (zoopa or something like that) that asks even even for your serxual persuasion. Be very careful about what you click on. Heart beat for me and my mum was out by around 20bmm. Putting us both over 100 . second was a lot close would just use my finger to take pulse tbh. Maybe I'm doing it wrong",2

9810,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"It works fine but the ads are really stressful especially when you have to take a quick heart rate check, the app sometimes breaks at startup or takes too long to open because its searching for ads to show you. If you have a real heart issue and need to take checks fast DO NOT USE this app, otherwise is ""OK""",2
9811,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"An otherwise fantastic app spoilt by the way advertising has been implemented. The monitor appears accurate, easy to use and has great graphics to monitor trends. However you have to watch an ad before use and close the ad page down. If you're relaxing, this is a minor irritation. But if you're running or engaging in intense activity, it's difficult and distracting to get rid of the ad. Worse, I was out of range of a mobile signal and the app wouldn't work at all!",2
9812,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,This app gives very confusing reading sometimes. Gives high reading at one point and immediately on next measure shows normal. But when compared with Pulseoxy meter it was consistent reading or 10 variations. Ads another issues. Do fix the issues in the app because it make many people to get panic because of this. Some times consistent readings it gives but some times gives most fluctuating readings despite measuring at same light and resting environment. Clueles,2

By the way, nice work Dev's keep going and make it more optimised ! I know it's hard to make such apps but still appreciateable!!",2
9815,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Not reliable. The readings massively varies when taken at the same interval. My readings read 112bpm and I took another couple of readings at the same time to see if it differs and it r read 72 & 78 bpm which shows inconsistency in readings. Not at all reliable. Don't go by an app instead buy a reliable medical instrument to get somewhat accurate readings.,2
9816,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"In my opinion, after one use, the app is unreliable. I tried a couple times to use it while I could feel my heart racing, and it kept telling me that my pulse was in the upper 60s and lower 70s. Then I would take my pulse myself, and each time it was 30-40 bpm higher than what the app said. In my opinion, just take the extra time to do it yourself.",2

Heart rate sensor is almost unusable because it takes 5 minutes sometimes to read bpm and the camera is so hot that I can't keep my finger on it long enough to finish the read.",2
9820,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,It was running fine til today. Now when I go to open it I just get the loading screen no ad and it just freezes on load up.

Could use some improvements.",2

Also this app has more than 28 trackers collecting personal& device info. Original review: Super EASY quick & accurate . Put finger over camera lens then click the giant ❤get results in seconds. U can save HR info &include what you are doing right then(active at rest intense run etc). The accuracy is equal to stethoscope or chest strap methods. Lots of good HR info included too.,2

9824,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"It's an okay app. I will agree, but the camera detecting the finger is kinda finicky and won't register my finger directly on the camera. I would use it again if the camera detecting the finger was fixed to actually detect the finger.",2
9825,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Having an ad playing at start up really makes it difficult to get an accurate reading for someone who's HR spikes and drops quickly.

I tried putting other object on the camera to see if it was fake, didn't work. So..I put something on the camera that was similar to the color of the finger when pressed against the flashlight. It got a heartbeat put of my iron man stuffed animal apparently. I do not believe this app actually works.",2
9830,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"I have 4 camera lenses on my phone. Using each camera gave me 4 different readings. The lowest was -0- and highest was 86. The scary part is that it keeps asking me to do a scan to see if ""this app"" has stolen my private info. Have not tried the scan just yet. I've now tried it a dozen times and got different readings, in a row. My latest findings tell me this app doesn't work for me. My smart fit watch is all I really need.",2

9996,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Inaccurate. It measured my pulse rate as 89 when I was sitting and relaxed. I measured manually immediately after using a timer and got a result of 54. I have a low resting heart rate so the app vastly overestimated my pulse rate.,2

10000,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"It's a good app and all, but as someone with a heart condition, all the ads at the beginning are really tedious. My heart rate varies dramatically by the minute, and waiting that extra time and having to find the tiny little x button to leave the ad is sometimes enough time to not get the quick measurement I need.

Worked well - verified with manual check - and was very helpful. Now (with a newer upgraded phone) it is yellow and is always waiting to stabilize or instructing me to press the finger or starting over midway. When it does catch a measurement, it is all over the place. While lying in bed, it will be 110, 55, and then 91 back to back.",3
10002,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"It is an okay app, however I don't feel it is a dependable measure. I took two readings within one minute and both readings were different. The 1st.

10003,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Deserves lower because you literally can't use this app unless you're connected to the Internet so it can load advertisements for you to watch before using the app. I couldn't believe when I didn't have Internet, I couldn't bypass the ads because this app will not let you use it unless it loads the ad which requires WiFi or mobile data. It's obnoxious to say the very least. But the good thing about it is after the annoying forceful ads, the app itself does work and seems accurate.",3
10004,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"It's a decent app, and I use it to keep tabs on my heart rate if I think I'm having issues, often times my heart rate spikes to unhealthy levels. My only issue with this app is the fact I have to watch an ad every time I open the app. If I'm opening this app it's not for fun, I could be on the verge of a heart attack the last thing I need is to see an ad for another app like this",3
10005,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"I took my heart rate very easily, and it seems to be correct for the most part. My only issue is that there needs to be an option and a change to how the app reacts to women who are pregnant, like myself. That's my only issue, is that the app is telling me I'm overweight with a high BMI... But I'm pregnant, so I'm seeing a lot about ads, but I was in the app for 5 minutes and only got one personally. It was as soon as the app started up, but that's better than during me interacting with the app.",3
10006,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Pretty good app but I'm finding it onerous to enter manual data such as my BP using a rolling dial - a numeric pad is ideal. Switching to another tab automatically resets the app to display another advertisement. This got really old quickly when I wanted to find what my last few readings were from my records in my phone notes. The HR monitor seems accurate enough. I would purchase the app for an ad free experience. The ads are bad enough for me to uninstall. Sorry 😞,3
10007,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Sadly, my new phone doesn't have a pulse oximeter, so I have to go back to the ""camera light"" heat rate apps - Many of which are notorious for ""doubling"" the heart rate for people with a low RHR.

10008,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,When one's heart goes off and you need to know heart rate asap waiting for ads to finish (skip ads option does not work) is not at all helpful. Bottom line: Does the app work? Yes. Is it available when needed? Not always. Fine for 'I'm just curious' casual use.,3
10009,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"It does its job well but the constant stalling every time I open the app because it searches for an ad makes me consider uninstalling altogether. Either make the timeout period shorter so that users don't have to sit there upwards of 5 minutes for a couple integer values to show up or make a paid variant of the app. It's a quality of life app that removes the quality of life with this effectively bogus ""ad break"". There's a reason I'm opening the app NOW to measure my pulse.",3
10010,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"I can't get a true reading if my HR is going down while this app decides to work or not. WHEN it works it seems to be about 90+% accurate! I'll probably still uninstall soon bc of inconsistency of availability when I try to use it. EDIT: I just realized it is the ad upon launch causing the failure when my connection is weak. Lol of course it is duh, facepalm!",3
10011,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Great app, I just wish it didn't make you wait for video ads to finish before you can use it when you need to know your heart rate sooner rather than later. Update: I did not have a bad experience, and I did support you with a 4 star rating. I never said you should not run ads. What I said was that ads should wait until after you check your heart rate, not before. A little professionalism would help here as well. You should never yell at people thru the use of all caps. Now you get 3 stars.",3
10012,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Mostly a very good app. I use it to monitor my aortic fibrillation. Unfortunately when I first open it the progress bar shows as complete but the screen stays for so long on the app loading screen that the tension and fast beat I need to track is already fading.,3
10013,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Downloaded to see if I was tachy or in A-fib. It seems pretty accurate as I compared it to my finger monitor at the same time. The only issue is the ads you have to view before you can monitor. Maybe place the ads after monitoring but before you get your results?,3
10014,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Readings are inconsistent which could be dangerous. Heart rate supposedly dropped from 105 to 64 in ten seconds. Looking for a new app.,3
10015,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"App is inaccurate on my device when used as advised, it overestimates my resting heart rate by about ~15bpm using my finger. It's possible that this is partly because it is difficult to know which lens to cover with the light as there is a camera array. If I put my phone on my wrist rather than my finger on the camera lens I get a reading which is closer to my stopwatch timed pulse. Also riddled with ads.",3
10016,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"The app seems OK, but the advertising is intrusive and grotesque. I suspect my pulse shot up by at least 10 bpm from being shocked by the obnoxious audio in one of the ads. To add to my review after the developer reply, you could just make your ads less obnoxious. Lots of ad-funded apps aren't this bad. I think three stars is generous.",3
10017,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"I used this app to check my pulse before donating plasma because I vape and they turn you away if it's too high. It worked great and gave accurate readings on my old LG Stylo 6, which had 3 cameras. But on my new Samsung A22, which has 4 cameras, it can't get a consistent, accurate reading. Within the span of three tests over three minutes, I was getting 58, 72, and 125. Giving it three stars because I know the app works on some phone models, but it's clear it also doesn't work on others.",3
10018,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Hi, the first day I used the app everything worked fine. But today there are no readings for blood pressure and blood sugar. It's currently daytime and I've turned on extra lights to ensure there's enough light, but still no readings for BP or B sugar. Anything I can do or check to make it work? I'll add stars if there's a solution. Thanks.",3
10019,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Would give it more stars if I could (1) turn off the buzzing of the measuring!; (2) could enlarge the measurement graph in f.e. landscape mode and see a more detailed graph with less smoothing; (3) could set the smoothing; and (4) give me an option to turn off ads!,3
10020,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Okay but takes a bit to load, so not good in an emergency, and then ads. The readings seem to be accurate to a real oximeter pulse. My complaint is when you enter your status, it lacks a post-workout status and perhaps a couple more.",3

10035,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"The app is nice and doesn't require unnecessary permissions, however the ads ruin it. Instead of banners they play full movies you have to wait 20 secs to skip. Not worth it.",3
10036,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Great app but really difficult to use on pixel 6. I have tried several apps and all of the others were able to detect the pulse except this one.,3
10037,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,What camera lense? Most phones nowadays have 3-4 lenses you need a way to figure out what lenses you are using. I don't know how accurate it is because I'm not sure I was completely covering the correct lense. Thanks for listening would be 5+ if not for that one issue.,3
10038,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Kinda barely works Google Pixel 5a. Got one reading out of 5 attempts so can we even say that the reading was good? Also couldn't find settings to remove the dorky pulsing vibration and heart monitor sound.,3
10039,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,This has ads when you open app and you gotta wait til the x to close pops up and itll pop up ad when in app after a while but it checks your heart rate and records it.,3
10040,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"First off I just want to say that I only downloaded this heart rate monitor app due to having severe cases of health anxiety/hypochondriaism and I needed an app to let me know I was ok. The reasons why I'm only rating this app with 3 stars is because I'm skeptical that I'm going to get fake or inaccurate results. I've been tricked into taking a test on a health app only to find out later that it was just a ""joke"" app. Can the developer of this app please respond to this, I need some reassurance",3
10041,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,I checked my heart rate 10 times in a row and every time it went normal then high normal then high. I wasn't expecting it to be accurate but how is it rated 4.8 when it's not detecting anything.,3
10042,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Hit or miss on accuracy Its fine for free but if need accurate you can trust readings , probably should pay for one. This one fine for free and thats the best thing that can be said pabout this",3
10043,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,I like this app very much but one thing is that when you touch it light it becomes too hot and hurt your finger. But thanks for this app it helps alot.,3
10044,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Does not work! Blood pressure works fine! I took outside for enough light for camera & pulse nothing!,3
10045,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Well it works but, you can't trust it. This gives wrong readings which could cause somebody to crash and burn with numbers that far off. Sorry folks better get this straightened out.",3
10046,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,It's reading is accurate if noise smartwatch reading is accurate. I measured my heart beat with both simultaneously. I found both were same.,3
10047,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"When this works, it's great, but my husband and I both struggle to get our fingers in the exact perfect spot to get a reading. Seems very difficult.",3
10048,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"I consider 59bpm/male when lying down, especially 'meditating', as perfectly normal for that condition not 'slow' . Yet if I choose 'exercising' it merely states 'warm up'. Now if during a bout of exercise my heart rate was only 59, I'd be very worried.",3
10049,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Just a suggestion, but maybe DON'T have the ads playing when you first open the app? Do it AFTER we get the results or something that won't put us at risk in a medical emergency. 🙃",3
10050,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Maybe you could make it load even if no ads is found. The app just stalls because it's trying to find an ad to show. Bad design,3
10051,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"It works but there's a major omission. I cannot find where to put in my correct age in this app & that's why I only gave it 3 stars. It works ok, but this, to me, is a major omission.",3
10052,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,I take my pulse rate before donating plasma. If my pulse is 100 or over I cannot donate. I use the app and my pulse is: 20beats less than my reading at the plasma center. It don't work well enough for me.,3
10053,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"I feel like the concept is good, and I like the tracking features but it's wildly inaccurate.",3
10054,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Accurate but for some reason the app turned my camera light on and it got really it where it told me to put my finger. It legit burned. Idk if I can use the app again if it's going to literally burn me every time 😓,3
10055,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"It's quite confusing; when I switch the finger from right to left hand or the other way around, it shows some significant difference of heart beats. Is something wrong with the app or my heart ?",3
10056,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Can't seem to make up it's mind what my heart rate is. One minute it's 154 and next minute it's 64. Doesn't match the readings from my pulse ox meter.,3
10057,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Have not tested this against an approved device and so I am unsure of its accuracy. The readings I took, some appeared in the general area and some way off.",3
10058,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,consider that people might need to access the monitor quickly and don't put the ads immediately when the app opens.,3
10059,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Who likes ads? But other than that she how the accuracy could be more suitably on point, I'd recommend this heart monitor to others.",3
10060,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"I have no problem with how it works. My complaint is on its analysis. It's inaccurate! I'm 65yrs old and BP ranges from 110/70 to 120/80 and yet it considers me hypertensive. I don't need my blood pressure to go higher than this, please. You ought to have medical advisers to put you through. Let's just leave it the way it is, measuring heart rate only.",3
10061,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"If you are okay with burning your fingers then this is the app for you. It is fine, and kind of cool, but can hurt when you put you finger on the light on your phone.",3
10062,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"It's pretty fun, I'm more or less trying it out because i want to start exercising, but be weary of my heart due to being anemic 😊 only on the second day so I'll find out 🤷",3
10063,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Nice enough, but no apparent way to turn off the heart rate BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! when taking a reading. Uninstalling.",3
10064,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"This is a very good app... I was trying your heart rate and later saw add, so your app. Deleted it, or downloaded another one.",3
10065,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"This app is inaccurate. I used the app and it said my heartrate was 114 bpm, but I took my pulse manually and it was actually at 84 bpm.",3
10066,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,In the description you forgot to mention the amount of data that is required to download. Just noticed and thought I would mention it.,3
10067,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"The icon make one believe it measurement is done using the fingerprint sensor, however it's uses the camera. Deceptive. Uninstall",3
10068,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Waoooh amazing 👏 😍 🙌 but me I want to know my readings very well that your pressure is high your too stressed so that I can relax very well .Thanks I like it.,3
10069,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Not bad. Does what it supposed to.,3
10070,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,It measures my heartrate fine but this app has ads for whatever reason which are very distracting especially when I'm having a heart palpitation,3
10071,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Good app but I could not find a purchase option to get rid of the very annoying adds.,3
10072,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,It's...good. The flashlight thing doesn't really work though as it burns your finger.,3
10073,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,I checked this with a some other devices and this is about 5 to 6 out on most things it could get better or could be made better,3
10074,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Not accurated. Tested while hooked up to a heart monitor at hospital. It was 15 beats faster than the one from the hospital,3
10075,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,This app is good. I used it and compared it with a monitor and it was only 2 digits off.,3
10076,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Why does it default to beeping and putting in values for age and gender without asking? Ads too frequent to be a useful app.,3
10077,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Recent update introduced a full screen video ad every time I switch to the app. Looking for alternative,3
10078,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Annoying screens pushing me to sign up for other things. And not quick to get rid of,3
10079,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,I would have given u 5 stars but take 3 for now . I cant measure my weight and the sugar level,3
10080,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Great idea, but it doesn't work well with the Google pixel 6 or other phones with multiple camera lenses",3
10081,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Easy to use, I thought that my pulse would have read high at 92 bpm, but this app called it as normal!",3
10082,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,This does work butttt my flashlight burnssss my finger when I hold it for 2 seconds and my finger stays red for 1minute or so I wish I found another way but at least it works,3
10083,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Burns your finger if you do you're reading 3 times .to get average reading.other wise .ok,3
10084,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,It's a very nice and easy app to use Just read the instructions and you will get the results,3
10085,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Its hard to use because of my phones cameras being separate and didn't work half the time,3
10086,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,This app is easy to use but has wildly inaccurate heart rate data.,3
10087,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Having to wait until ad's finish to run makes it inaccurate in taking heart rate.,3
10088,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,It kind of burned my finger. From what I could tell the measurement was fairly accurate.,3
10089,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Does not match with boat smart watch. Not sure which is right 🤔,3
10090,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Slow start up time, doesn't measure long enough to get accurate reading",3
10091,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"The app worked well, but my finger got very hot while it was taking my heart rate.",3
10092,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Great app, but slow loading with ads at the Start.",3
10093,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"I honestly don't know if this is just for fun or not. I don't have a real heart monitor, so I have nothing to compare it with.",3
10094,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Working but flashlight is burning the finger. Plz fix if possible Thanks,3
10095,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Works well but the camera light gets uncomfortably hot.,3
10096,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,I did not like how it beeps loud when it it's measuring my heart rate.,3
10097,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Measured my heart rate 3 times in gaps of 10 seconds. First it showed 97, then 81 and then 115. How to rely?",3
10098,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Pressing my finger on the flashlight burns! Ouch! Cannot use.,3
10099,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,This app is very useful for elders such as grandparents and parents but there are adds so I give 3 stars,3
10100,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,It's really working good before checking here i checked my pulse oximeter it's similar result...,3
10101,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Just downloaded, this app with make a good heart rate tracker.",3
10102,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Finger print working well and application really cool,3
10103,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"It seems accurate but each time I tried using it I got burnt, it might just be my phone tho",3
10104,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"I dont know what to rate, but did it burn anyone else's finger? I have a samsung galaxy s10",3
10105,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Too much ads,3
10106,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Needs pay option to remove ads.,3
10107,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,not bad so far,3
10108,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,I hate the ads,3
10109,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Why don't they just use banner ads like other apps do?,3
10110,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Not clear, more ad's, How to check, ✔️ describe it?",3
10111,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Is very nice, sometimes I find some difficulties in it but not bad so far",3

10114,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Too many ads but it's okay 👍,3

10122,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"All Time it is showing that I'm resting,,,but not so bad",3
10123,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Not sure...shows double what my fitbit reports after numerous tries,3
10124,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Okay I've seen other reviews and I must agree with one it burns my finger after around 4-5 seconds and I still felt it after 10 minutes,3

10222,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,It is very helpfull,3
10223,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Readings are inconsistent which could be dangerous. Heart rate supposedly dropped from 105 to 64 in ten seconds. Looking for a new app.,3
10224,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,𝟹 𝚜𝚝𝚊𝚛 𝚊𝚙𝚙𝚕𝚒𝚊𝚗𝚌𝚎 𝚠𝚒𝚝𝚑𝚒𝚗 𝚒𝚝𝚜𝚎𝚕𝚏...,3
10225,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,When one's heart goes off and you need to know heart rate asap waiting for ads to finish (skip ads option does not work) is not at all helpful. Bottom line: Does the app work? Yes. Is it available when needed? Not always. Fine for 'I'm just curious' casual use.,3
10226,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Good 👍,3
10227,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,I don't know how this thing Works with me to be unis,3
10228,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Won't open half the time,3
10229,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,I hate the ads,3
10230,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"I think the app is cool and all, but not cool to the touch. Maybe I am using it wrong. I think an introductory video showing the user how to use could be tremendously helpful.",3
10231,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Khokonsheik,3
10232,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Downloaded to see if I was tachy or in A-fib. It seems pretty accurate as I compared it to my finger monitor at the same time. The only issue is the ads you have to view before you can monitor. Maybe place the ads after monitoring but before you get your results?,3
10233,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,✌️🎧,3
10234,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,I have heart disease and it comes in handy.,3
10235,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,It measures my heartrate fine but this app has ads for whatever reason which are very distracting especially when I'm having a heart palpitation,3
10236,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Amazing it's right on the 💰,3
10237,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Nice apps,3
10238,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Love it,3
10239,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Idk if it's true or not,3
10240,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Just downloaded, this app with make a good heart rate tracker.",3
10241,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,It's a good app but if it says your pulse is wildly high (just got 125 bpm even though I'm feeling fine and at rest) you have to retake your measurement. The next measurement I got was legitimate which was 69 bpm so it is somewhat inaccurate sometimes and can be a cause for concern when it need not be.,3
10242,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Hit or miss on accuracy Its fine for free but if need accurate you can trust readings , probably should pay for one. This one fine for free and thats the best thing that can be said pabout this",3
10243,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"This is a very good app... I was trying your heart rate and later saw add, so your app. Deleted it, or downloaded another one.",3
10244,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Ok,3
10245,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"First time using not enough time using it, but it is easy to use. The first reading was close to my blood pressure monitor reading.",3
10246,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,I checked my heart rate 10 times in a row and every time it went normal then high normal then high. I wasn't expecting it to be accurate but how is it rated 4.8 when it's not detecting anything.,3
10247,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,It says o2 sensor but there isn't one.,3
10248,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Absolutely incredible,3
10249,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,nice and clearly to adapt,3
10250,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,It lies most times,3
10251,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Need to use more to leave accurate rating,3
10252,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,This has ads when you open app and you gotta wait til the x to close pops up and itll pop up ad when in app after a while but it checks your heart rate and records it.,3
10253,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Good app,3
10254,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Great app, I just wish it didn't make you wait for video ads to finish before you can use it when you need to know your heart rate sooner rather than later. Update: I did not have a bad experience, and I did support you with a 4 star rating. I never said you should not run ads. What I said was that ads should wait until after you check your heart rate, not before. A little professionalism would help here as well. You should never yell at people thru the use of all caps. Now you get 3 stars.",3
10255,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,I would have given u 5 stars but take 3 for now . I cant measure my weight and the sugar level,3
10256,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Too much publicity,3
10257,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Fake app,3
10258,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Burns your finger if you do you're reading 3 times .to get average reading.other wise .ok,3
10259,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Really appreciated the app,3
10260,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Good afternoon,3
10261,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"First off I just want to say that I only downloaded this heart rate monitor app due to having severe cases of health anxiety/hypochondriaism and I needed an app to let me know I was ok. The reasons why I'm only rating this app with 3 stars is because I'm skeptical that I'm going to get fake or inaccurate results. I've been tricked into taking a test on a health app only to find out later that it was just a ""joke"" app. Can the developer of this app please respond to this, I need some reassurance",3
10262,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,So far so good,3
10263,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,I like this app very much but one thing is that when you touch it light it becomes too hot and hurt your finger. But thanks for this app it helps alot.,3
10264,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Sometimes it takes so long for the add to load and countdown, that my heart rate is back to normal. I have caught my heart rate high quite a few times, but that is only when the add pops up fast so it can clear fast.",3
10265,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Heart isnt beeting the way it should but app says its normal,3
10266,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,ওওও,3
10267,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Is very nice, sometimes I find some difficulties in it but not bad so far",3
10268,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Very nice experience,3
10269,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Okay but takes a bit to load, so not good in an emergency, and then ads. The readings seem to be accurate to a real oximeter pulse. My complaint is when you enter your status, it lacks a post-workout status and perhaps a couple more.",3
10270,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Needs pay option to remove ads.,3
10271,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Nervous...I was asked for my credit card number and email. Have I just been scammed? I'm calling my credit company now...on hold.,3
10272,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Pretty good app but I'm finding it onerous to enter manual data such as my BP using a rolling dial - a numeric pad is ideal. Switching to another tab automatically resets the app to display another advertisement. This got really old quickly when I wanted to find what my last few readings were from my records in my phone notes. The HR monitor seems accurate enough. I would purchase the app for an ad free experience. The ads are bad enough for me to uninstall. Sorry 😞,3
10273,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Good app,3
10274,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,My doctor said I had high blood pressure but this told me I was normal,3
10275,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Good app of measuring the BP etc,3
10276,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Not wht i wanted,3
10277,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Great,3
10278,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Too many ads,3
10279,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,The light burned my finger,3
10280,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Nice..😉😉😉,3
10281,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"I consider 59bpm/male when lying down, especially 'meditating', as perfectly normal for that condition not 'slow' . Yet if I choose 'exercising' it merely states 'warm up'. Now if during a bout of exercise my heart rate was only 59, I'd be very worried.",3
10282,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,In the description you forgot to mention the amount of data that is required to download. Just noticed and thought I would mention it.,3
10283,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,I just downloaded but so far I like it.. I just hope it's accurate.. Will update as I get to know the app a little better,3
10284,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"If you are okay with burning your fingers then this is the app for you. It is fine, and kind of cool, but can hurt when you put you finger on the light on your phone.",3
10285,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Sadly, my new phone doesn't have a pulse oximeter, so I have to go back to the ""camera light"" heat rate apps - Many of which are notorious for ""doubling"" the heart rate for people with a low RHR. (So a 43 gets read as an 86). This app is apparently no different. And make the option to shut off the measurement beeping, easier to find - if it even exists at all.",3
10286,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Hi, the first day I used the app everything worked fine. But today there are no readings for blood pressure and blood sugar. It's currently daytime and I've turned on extra lights to ensure there's enough light, but still no readings for BP or B sugar. Anything I can do or check to make it work? I'll add stars if there's a solution. Thanks.",3
10287,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"It's quite confusing; when I switch the finger from right to left hand or the other way around, it shows some significant difference of heart beats. Is something wrong with the app or my heart ?",3
10288,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Please don't ask me to rate so quickly. After two measurements, are you crazy?",3
10289,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"I can't get a true reading if my HR is going down while this app decides to work or not. WHEN it works it seems to be about 90+% accurate! I'll probably still uninstall soon bc of inconsistency of availability when I try to use it. EDIT: I just realized it is the ad upon launch causing the failure when my connection is weak. Lol of course it is duh, facepalm!",3
10290,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,its great,3
10291,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Nice,3
10292,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"App is inaccurate on my device when used as advised, it overestimates my resting heart rate by about ~15bpm using my finger. It's possible that this is partly because it is difficult to know which lens to cover with the light as there is a camera array. If I put my phone on my wrist rather than my finger on the camera lens I get a reading which is closer to my stopwatch timed pulse. Also riddled with ads.",3
10293,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Trying it out if it works ill give it 5 stars and tell why its a 5 star app,3
10294,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"This app is inaccurate. I used the app and it said my heartrate was 114 bpm, but I took my pulse manually and it was actually at 84 bpm.",3
10295,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"The app is not good or perhaps I have got paradoxical pulse - stress response, while being extremely anxious this app telling me that my pulse is NORMAL 😂😭🤔😰😱🙄 but I feel like I am just about to die! Now that wasp come into my apartment I am going to make a measurement now!: And it's normal again but measurement after measurement it's showing 20-25 difference in the pulse rate per minute - strange? The time of each measurement is too low! I'm think. 🤔",3

10297,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Good app for Heart rate,3
10298,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Great app, but slow loading with ads at the Start.",3
10299,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Does not match with boat smart watch. Not sure which is right 🤔,3
10300,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"It's a decent app, and I use it to keep tabs on my heart rate if I think I'm having issues, often times my heart rate spikes to unhealthy levels. My only issue with this app is the fact I have to watch an ad every time I open the app. If I'm opening this app it's not for fun, I could be on the verge of a heart attack the last thing I need is to see an ad for another app like this",3
10301,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Ok,3
10302,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,So far so good... Bit confused tho' 🤔 1st time 60... 2nd time over 100 and I'd not moved... But... I did change the position and pressure used on the camera lense... I'll continue to monitor best and most accurate way to test...,3
10303,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Not accurated. Tested while hooked up to a heart monitor at hospital. It was 15 beats faster than the one from the hospital,3
10304,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Seems faster than actually is,3
10305,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Pressing my finger on the flashlight burns! Ouch! Cannot use.,3

I'm 65yrs old and BP ranges from 110/70 to 120/80 and yet it considers me hypertensive. I don't need my blood pressure to go higher than this, please. You ought to have medical advisers to put you through. Let's just leave it the way it is, measuring heart rate only.",3
10317,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Working but flashlight is burning the finger. Plz fix if possible Thanks,3
10318,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Ads. Might given my phone a virus.,3
10319,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Nice,3

10321,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Good 😊,3
10322,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,quite good,3
10323,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"The app seems OK, but the advertising is intrusive and grotesque. I suspect my pulse shot up by at least 10 bpm from being shocked by the obnoxious audio in one of the ads. To add to my review after the developer reply, you could just make your ads less obnoxious. Lots of ad-funded apps aren't this bad. I think three stars is generous.",3
10324,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,This is useless app one man different time different different report,3
10325,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"This would be good, but you get an add with every button you press. It drove me crazy. Had to delete. Otherwise, it seemed good. The heart rate monitor always gave me a lower reading than my BP monitor, but I don't know which one was wrong.",3

10334,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"It does its job well but the constant stalling every time I open the app because it searches for an ad makes me consider uninstalling altogether. Either make the timeout period shorter so that users don't have to sit there upwards of 5 minutes for a couple integer values to show up or make a paid variant of the app. It's a quality of life app that removes the quality of life with this effectively bogus ""ad break"". There's a reason I'm opening the app NOW to measure my pulse.",3
10335,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"It's a good app and all, but as someone with a heart condition, all the ads at the beginning are really tedious. My heart rate varies dramatically by the minute, and waiting that extra time and having to find the tiny little x button to leave the ad is sometimes enough time to not get the quick measurement I need. Otherwise, it's usually pretty accurate, and pretty easy to use.",3
10336,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Better app,3
10337,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Maybe you could make it load even if no ads is found. The app just stalls because it's trying to find an ad to show. Bad design,3

10341,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Accurate but for some reason the app turned my camera light on and it got really it where it told me to put my finger. It legit burned. Idk if I can use the app again if it's going to literally burn me every time 😓,3
10342,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Very nice this app,3

10387,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Lovely,3
10388,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Too many ads but it's okay 👍,3
10389,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Good app in general, but please add the option of purchasing ad free version like other apps do. I don't mind paying for a good app but having no such option reduces usability.",3
10390,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"I used this app to check my pulse before donating plasma because I vape and they turn you away if it's too high. It worked great and gave accurate readings on my old LG Stylo 6, which had 3 cameras. But on my new Samsung A22, which has 4 cameras, it can't get a consistent, accurate reading. Within the span of three tests over three minutes, I was getting 58, 72, and 125. Giving it three stars because I know the app works on some phone models, but it's clear it also doesn't work on others.",3
10391,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Just a suggestion, but maybe DON'T have the ads playing when you first open the app? Do it AFTER we get the results or something that won't put us at risk in a medical emergency. 🙃",3
10392,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Working not so bed,3
10393,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Just worth it!!,3
10394,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,How can I edit my age? I am 61 and the app has just assumed I am 35.,3
10395,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Deserves lower because you literally can't use this app unless you're connected to the Internet so it can load advertisements for you to watch before using the app. I couldn't believe when I didn't have Internet, I couldn't bypass the ads because this app will not let you use it unless it loads the ad which requires WiFi or mobile data. It's obnoxious to say the very least. But the good thing about it is after the annoying forceful ads, the app itself does work and seems accurate.",3
10396,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Recent update introduced a full screen video ad every time I switch to the app. Looking for alternative,3
10397,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Good,3
10398,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Nice app,3
10399,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Not sure...shows double what my fitbit reports after numerous tries,3
10400,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"It works, and I don't really have much to say about the app, but please make sure you turn off your flashlight, At least with some phones. I have a Samsung s10 and I have been getting burns from holding my finger over the flashlight. The noise is extremely annoying and I wish I knew to turn off the flashlight beforehand. So I word of advice: turn off the noise and flashlight",4
10401,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Overall, pretty useful, well built, and has good features such as tracking trends, comparing different heart rates with differing levels of physical or mental activity, etc. Basic reader works for the most part, very well; half the reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that I hadtrouble with the monitor on just a couple phone models. Ofcourse there are ads in the app, I'm not sure if they are allowed to use metadata- if they are, they'd sure have a lot of personal data on people.",4
10402,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Quick and easy and accurate. The added info and facts surrounding heart heath is an added bonus. Update. Dont know if the app had an update, but now its difficult to get a reading using the camera on my phone. Hardly works. Stops mid test and starts over. The heart icon in the app used to turned red when you covered the camera. Doesnt do that anymore. Ugh. Just when something was working.",4
10403,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Response (thank you) from developer seemed to solve all problems. I also complained about ads, though I normally don't mind. But I kept getting a full screen blocking ad for blood pressure pgm whenever I started. I am beginning to think that was a Google play ad inserted separately, not by this pgm, which I would not be shocked. Will try this fine pgm again when I have time to do it justice (ie, have time to learn all the options and features.)",4
10404,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"It's about the best you get, now that Samsung took away the pulseox feature away from the health app. Takes a second to learn, because you have to figure out which camera lense it's using, and some phones may not be able to use it, because the light may not me located close enough to the chosen lense, to work. Needs to light your finger up bright red over the camera (long story short) to work right.",4
10405,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,I tried 3 different heart rate apps and the readings on all 3 were close. Readings were 81 84 75. I didn't choose this one. It's a decent app though. I signed up with the free trial for this one. Cancelled after that. Easy to use. Accurate. I had a lot of ads popping up. It's decent but there's better.,4
10406,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Not a fan of the intrusive ad during exploration of the app, but at least I was able to get in a few readings and play with different settings and compare to my Omron reader. It's a nice app and can track history. I am looking for an app that will show real time HR, which this does but only for 30 seconds.",4
10407,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Seems quite accurate and really like the UI. Deducting a star because ads come up at obnoxious times. I understand the need to monetize to fund development so an option to pay for the app should be offered. I would be delighted to purchase and based on the reviews I know others would too in order to have a more pleasant UX offered. Please consider.,4
10408,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Its very accurate. Close to five star. I understand they need ads to make money and it doesn't hit you with ads to often. The only issue is because it hits you with an ad when you open it and some of the ads are long and loud if I'm in a hurry to measure my HR it takes to long. All around a good app though.,4
10409,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Good but how can I turn off vibrate when it's counting beats? I can mute the sound but not turn off vibrate?,4
10410,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Great but I want to pay to remove ads. It's one of those apps where you have ads but there is no way to pay to remove them. Being it a heart monitor, it is kind of weird that it makes you angry by showing you an ad before you take your pulse every single time. If they just ad the possibility to remove the ads for a fair price then it will certainly be the greatest app for it's porpoise.",4
10411,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Day 1- free reading & analysis w/o credit card. Like the User interface better than the heartify app on ipad. Readings are consistent (only 3 measurements in, not sure why do they ask us rate apps like this after 5 minutes!) Don't fall for similar apps claiminh blood pressure measurements: that technology is not out yet, few years down the road. Could easily get to 5 stars but need 3 days to justify",4
10412,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"It seems to be accurate but burns my finger after 5 seconds, I read other reviews & see other people have had the same problem, so I turned the flashlight off as advised & it will not work at all with it off. It is not just a little bit hot, its like putting you finger on a hot light bulb, so yeah, not so good really and needs sorting out somehow. Shame really, cos like I say, it seemed quite accurate.",4
10413,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,I like not having to go to the store to have my blood pressure taken. And all the extra information on my heart rate.,4
10414,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,It's not very accurate but is ok for a ballpark reading.,4
10415,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Well done..your app gives the heart rate results but a lot of ads,4
10416,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,lots of ads and it takes a while for it to work,4
10417,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Perfect. Except for the adds.,4
10418,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"I'm not sure why it is accurate half the time. Example: I know my heart rate was slow (resting). Yet it read 117 bpm. Did it again immediately after, and it was in the 60s (accurate). Did it again, in the 90s.. Too unreliable. *Updated to 4 stars, will try the suggestions.",4
10419,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Update - finally figured out how to change the app language back from Russian to English. We'll see if it stays that way. ... Earlier - I downloaded the app yesterday. It worked fine. Then overnight, the language switched from English to something that looks like Russian. I have no idea how to switch it back because everything is in a language I don't understand.",4
10420,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Works pretty good on my S22 Ultra considering Samsung removed the actual sensor on thier more current phones. I wish it didn't have adds but that's how pretty much all free versions of apps are now. You only have to wait through one and it's only for 5 seconds or so. Pretty quick compared to some other free apps I've used.,4
10421,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"The app works well and is fairly accurate. The only thing that I would ""complain"" about is that there should be an option to remove ads. I am willing to pay to remove the startup ad but there isn't even a choice to do so.",4
10422,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"The loading time of the app is unreasonably long. Otherwise, everything is fine. P.S. reply: cmon guys, I have stable internet, but even I didnt, I'm SE myself and we have heavy games with dozen microservices on unity that require internet and loading much faster than your app.",4
10423,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,The first time I downloaded it I stream my phone up. I like the app but I had to get rid of the app and redownload it because it was bombarding my phone with commercials that was interrupting everything.,4
10424,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"not bad, it has some trouble getting my pulse sometimes and it can be almost like 10bpm off sometimes, so I wouldn't use this for a concrete heart rate, but just for an idea of what it is it's pretty good overall. the ads are annoying sometimes but they're over in like 2 seconds.",4
10425,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Great app, however I noticed you can get a reading on any part of your body as suspected it likes the colour red. However what made me believe in the app that different areas of thd body gives different readings from your finger.",4
10426,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"The readings are pretty accurate (compared them with blood pressure monitors), but the app takes forever to launch. Every single time. My internet is great and I have no such issues with any other app on my phone.",4
10427,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Make sure you use the correct camera. I was getting answers so thought it was working. But tried 4 timed and got 4 completely different answers. Then realised it needed my middle camera lens not the top one. After that the results were consistent.,4
10428,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,This could be a good app I felt it was not accurate but anytime you are wearing a watch with health monitors remember they are a guide and there may be inconsistent readings. That could be due to the device. It is a good thing that they doubt share with their parties.,4
10429,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Decent, would give 3.5 if possible. It is really cool to be able to track this, espically with no watch and in such short time. But sometimes it is inaccurate for example, my Fitbit says 129... App says 113. So it is not very accurate but still impressive for just a app.",4
10430,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Works. Results seem to be correct. But takes a long time to start up (should o be concerned that it's doing something ""unusual""?) and I can't figure out how to disable the annoying loud beep while taking measurements.",4
10431,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,I occasionally check the accuracy of this app by checking my pulse rate manually. It seems to be fairly accurate and a fairly good app. I am a senior citizen who has found this app to be fairly accurate and useful for me. I hope that it may prove to be somewhat useful to other seniors too.,4
10432,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,This app is very useful and tells you your heart rate and is just very useful. The only problem is that it's not always 100% accurate. Like this one time I got home from a trampoline park and it said that my heart rate was slow even though it was beating like crazy. But other than that it's a pretty good app.,4
10433,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"It seems to work good compared to the galaxy watch, but need to cut out the ads before and right after the reading, the app could save someones life but could prolong getting emergency care if needed with all the ads.",4
10434,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,It seems to be a good app; the only thing is if I could compare my heart rate as the app says it is to another app or piece of medical equipment I would be extremely happy. I only want to compare with another piece of equipment because the doctor said that when they did a Holter Monitor my heart rate wasn't that fast.,4
10435,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"It works well and seems accurate, as long as you hold your finger in front of the camera when measuring for a pulse. The app contains ads, but they're minimal and easy to skip.",4
10436,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Accuracy is acceptable however it gave 140bpm for a red piece of paper. So I am confused about the effects of external factors. Edit: Thanks for the explanation. I hope you reduce the losing time of the app.,4
10437,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Loop holes but if you do it right' you get props,",4
10438,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,It is a good app highly recommend to check heart rate only,4
10439,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"I was diagnosed with Pots yrs ago, it's not a bad case but I do like to keep track of my heart rate when it gets bad as I've dealt with a few doctors who refused to listen to me, and blame my symptoms on ""anxiety""/""poor diet"" so Its great this app keeps records of past flair ups. My only issue is the gender selection, im actively going through HRT, but not surgically transitioned from a bio female to look closer to a male, im confused as to whether I should use male or female? Does it matter??",4
10440,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Thank you for your app I gonna track myself and see.lean and understand. I have started but it seems to be accurate. Though My results were little bit not good.,4
10441,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Very good app works well and has a lot of free information that is useful, but every time you oppen the app you are met with an add, worth it though",4
10442,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Nice app. Later when in hospital and being connected to a heart rate monitor I could check the quality of the signal. Absolutely superb. There never wasa difference bigger than 2.,4
10443,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"The only part I don't like is the loud medical style beeping sound when it is measuring. Make sure to have your sound off when using this app. Other than that, this is my favorite of 3 heart rate apps.",4
10444,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"The only complaint is the ad when first starting up the app. If you need to check your heart rate in a hurry, you have to wait through an ad at times first. Otherwise, it is a good app. It so far has been accurate for me.",4
10445,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Works as described. Would like a setting to turn off the ad sounds. Had to log during a movie at a theater and the ad was loud.,4
10446,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Seems to work okay. I'm using it on Xiaomi 11T and don't have any problems with burning my finger on the flashlight. It doesn't get hot on this phone. The only problem I have with it is that I'm not sure if the readings are correct every time.,4
10447,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,It works. I've even compared to just feeling for my pulse and timing it and it's accurate. I also like that I can save the results. Only peeve is the ads can get annoying.,4
10448,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Done what I wanted it to.. of course there's an occasional Advert but that's normal for most apps.. I Tried afew other apps that were asking for me to allow my data to be shared to install it, this is simple..",4
10449,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"So far it's been a good app, just wish you could add if you have a previous ailment with your heart, I think it could be more accurate with that person. I have AFib, so if I was to high or low it would alert you.",4
10450,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,I want to know my heart rate immediately after I exercise as I am trying to reach a certain % of my maximum heart rate. The 15-20 seconds of ads really changes the actual outcome. Other heart monitor apps are free but don't the ads in the beginning of the reading.,4
10451,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Have to say that it's pretty neat But it asks to place the finger on the camera lens but mine only works over the flashlight and it's very hot. I done burnt my finger tryin to take the pulse.,4
10452,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Camera reading works very well every time. Seems to be a good supplemental app. Would recommend it!,4
10453,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Could be more accurate, but works well. Suprising to see an actual measurement app among the sea of scams :)",4
10454,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Didnt have my bp cup so I meeded to check it. Found out about this app from my mom and downloaded it on my phone. My phone has 3 cameras so had to figure that part out. Bp was taken in less than a minute showing what a low, regular or high bp should be... I like it",4
10455,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,I haven't used it but 5 minutes let's see what it does in a month then I can rate it. Especially if it's free Free is always best! I don't want to have to pay for something like this.,4
10456,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,I think works perfectly so far,4
10457,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"While measuring heart rate, getting beep sound. It is disturbing others when I use the app at 3am or 4am. Need setting to switch off that beep sound.",4
10458,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Great App. Please add an option for payment to remove the ads.,4
10459,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,I wish there was something that you could put down that you are pregnant. It is super easy to use I used it during my last pregnancy to watch my BP and show my doctors it do to the fact that I am prone to preeclampsia.,4
10460,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Sometimes it's nice to know YOUR heartrate but it's even better to use this app as an icebreaker on 1st dates. 😃. How nervous are they really? 😈 . I'm not 100% sure of the . I WOULDN'T use it as a basis for medical treatment EVER!,4
10461,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Application is very good. The question is how reliable the results are and on what standards. Ok it counts the beat rate but does it catches instantaneous arrhythmia?,4
10462,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Seems pretty accurate, not ro versed on the workings of the technology but heard of its use before by a freind who developed a heart condition and needed to keep an eye, pretty cool features on it aswell from first glance",4
10463,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"love this app, it's really great but there's one problem and that is the vibration I've turned off vibration in my phone but I can't see any option to turn it off in the app, is it necessary for accuracy?",4
10464,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Flashlight gets super hot! I had to try to get my first monitor done 4 times cause the flashlight sensor got so hot it was burning my fingertips.,4
10465,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Difficult to open and understand instructions. To many ads. We'll see what happens 😉,4
10466,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Pretty basic pulse app. Readings are quite accurate. It would be nice to see a full rythm but not bad for a cell phone app,4
10467,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Good app. Measuring the heart beat rightly. Checked against oximeter. The values are almost identical. Great work!,4
10468,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Compared to I watch better than this app good any proofly your work nice but add showing inside app is working for irritate,difficult and I am wish to next update is a very interesting so I am waiting",4
10469,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Very nice app for heart beat (pulse rate) measure. But it can't measure it accurately if my heart beats 76 times pm then it shows 83 b pm. So plz fix this then i like to give you all 5 stars.,4
10470,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"The app is easy to use and it is convenient. I get a few adds every once in a while, but not always. Otherwise I am happy with the app",4
10471,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,This app works really well and does really good about giving me my results but need to fix at times it will not do it no matter how long I hold my finger on the lense,4
10472,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,That's good for emergency. But You should made it add free to watch analysis of heartbeat & pulse rate.,4
10473,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Would like more tutorials on the app, it said I shows heart rate and pulse on the info but I'm not sure were the pulse is on it or how to interpret everything other then the heart rate",4
10474,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Easy, accurate , well readable for fuzzy vision when you can't find your glasses lol",4
10475,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Worked surprisingly well! My new phone has 4 lenses so I found it necessary to hold my finger over the middle one (unmentioned info).,4
10476,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"It records my heartbeat, pretty nice. I think it limits how frequently you can check it for free so no 5 star.",4
10477,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"This app can measure heart rate, blood pressure, blood sugar, and weight/BMI. When I measure these things on my body I can see if I need to help my body",4
10478,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Marvellous! 🤗🤗 Easy to use and very handy can be done anytime, anyplace, anywhere. ✅️",4
10479,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Use common sense if u don't feel right , something small or big could be wrong, this app is very good.",4
10480,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Very user friendly. Still need to confirm accuracy though 👍🏻❣️but all in all would recommend 👌🏻,4
10481,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"I tested it with a pulse oximeter on the opppsite hand at work its pretty accurate, best one ive used yet.",4
10482,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Worked with my OnePlus 9, but give us a way to turn off that annoying beep when taking a measurement.",4
10483,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Only four stars as have only used it a few times so far, but readings are not a million miles away from results a leading chemists monitor",4
10484,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Very useful app,4
10485,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,I just started with this app because of AFib. That seems to be working correctly. But I am not informed enough to give you a proper rating.,4
10486,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"I love it, it helps Me.",4
10487,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Measures your heart rate and keeps track of it,4
10488,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,it's what it says it would do I'm please with this app,4
10489,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Just used first time. Looks promising but couldn't find where to sign in, register reads, or request privacy. Can you assist? Thanks.",4
10490,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Great for reassuring and keeping tract of your heart but will need to compare with proper equipment to check accuracy,4
10491,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Just started using this app so I will give it a four stars for now and see how it monitors my heart rate and other things. And then I can come back and give more stars,4
10492,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,App is great until an ad pops up right in middle of a measurement lol,4
10493,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Quite accurate and pretty convenient and easy to use.,4
10494,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Really good, just shame it can't do your blood pressure through sensor on phone",4
10495,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Accuracy is good but if u guys remove ads I will give you 5 stars. Ads are making the UI cheap.,4
10496,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Works good, EKG tracing is only for Heart Rate. The camera phone light actually gets hot against to finger.",4
10497,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Seems to just put out any number .Accuracy questionable.,4
10498,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,It should have an option for when one is unwell/sick as It would be good to know about your heart rate then.,4
10499,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"This app is pretty good, I tested it against a Omron Presion monitor and it was only off by one number, so I would say that this app is good.",4

10524,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Day 1- free reading & analysis w/o credit card. Like the User interface better than the heartify app on ipad. Readings are consistent (only 3 measurements in, not sure why do they ask us rate apps like this after 5 minutes!) Don't fall for similar apps claiminh blood pressure measurements: that technology is not out yet, few years down the road. Could easily get to 5 stars but need 3 days to justify",4

10551,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"I was diagnosed with Pots yrs ago, it's not a bad case but I do like to keep track of my heart rate when it gets bad as I've dealt with a few doctors who refused to listen to me, and blame my symptoms on ""anxiety""/""poor diet"" so Its great this app keeps records of past flair ups. My only issue is the gender selection, im actively going through HRT, but not surgically transitioned from a bio female to look closer to a male, im confused as to whether I should use male or female? Does it matter??",4
10552,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"As someone with a problem heart, I find this very reassuring.",4
10553,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Its very accurate. Close to five star. I understand they need ads to make money and it doesn't hit you with ads to often. The only issue is because it hits you with an ad when you open it and some of the ads are long and loud if I'm in a hurry to measure my HR it takes to long. All around a good app though.,4
10554,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Seems a good app,4

10593,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Good experience,4
10594,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Just started using this app so I will give it a four stars for now and see how it monitors my heart rate and other things. And then I can come back and give more stars,4
10595,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Its very good,4
10596,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Bast app,4

10598,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Nice,4
10599,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Really good, just shame it can't do your blood pressure through sensor on phone",4
10600,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"This is a very useful, accurate, and precise measure. The features and sort options provide specific, educated results that are unique to this app alone. Although there has been complaints about ads, I have to disagree. They're always short (8 second or under+skip option) and allow the app to remain free of charge, which I think outweighs a couple seconds. Overall, it's a great utility for anyone to have, and I highly recommend it.",5
10601,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Started using this due to a sudden episode of tachycardia that wouldn't stop, even when resting for hours. Very easy-to-use. I'm not sure how the readings manage to be relatively accurate, but they can because I double check with the manual method. The accuracy of the app is good enough ±3-5bpm (for me). I like that it keeps a record for reference. The ads aren't annoying and there's no pay wall that I'm aware of for the full report, which is great. I will keep using this app to monitor my rate.",5
10602,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Works great. I missed my built in HR monitor from my Galaxy S8 when I upgraded my phone, and ended up keeping my old phone around just to use it for that purpose, but i can't carry around 2 phones all the time. This is just as accurate as my old phone and now I don't need to carry both. The noise was too hospital for me, and I was glad I could turn it off. I wish I could turn off the vibration, too, to help with biofeedback without distraction.",5
10603,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Worked perfectly. / Couldn't be easier to use. / Took only seconds for results. / Compared with CO2 finger monitor, results were identical. / HINT: DON'T SKIP INTRODUCTION. You don't have to turn on your flashlight if you're in an average lit room. Just place your finger over camera lens, start, lens will glow red and you will hear beeping. Look at your screen (bottom left corner) to see that your finger is positioned entirely over the camera lens and just wait for results. Easy, Fast.",5
10604,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Actually works! Seems like something that would be cool in concept, and not deliver, but this app wend way over my expectations, not only does it work, it works really well! I just got a smartwatch and I wanted to test if the reading was accurate so I did it at the same time as the app and the number was the same on both. It's fascinating how it works. There are also so few ads (if any at all) and I really appreciate that",5
10605,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"I'm not sure how accurate it is, but Google says that camera pulse detection apps and technology is decently accurate. It did scare me at first though! As the app is detecting your pulse rate, an EKG rhythm strip runs over top. Suggesting that's the rhythm you are in. This depiction of a cardiac rhythm is NOT a healthy rhythm. It shows A-Flutter. NOT a Normal Sinus rhythm. When I saw this, I immediately began to panic! And then... I realized it's actually just repeating pattern 😳😐",5
10606,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"I love how the application sync's with your email account. The app also helps you really make better lifestyle changes. I can say they have ad's but it wasn't too terribly disturbing, they're short. Last but not least, it was easy to navigate and read the information they were presenting you!",5
10607,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Off the bat, great to use, easy interface, accurate data, and lots of tools to use for gaining insight as to what is considered to be actually ""normal"" or not. Most apps., and like, don't like to actually be that detail oriented, or actually really do as they claim. This app puts its money where its mouth is. And it's free, which is even more amazing!!!! Keep up the good work! 👍",5
10608,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Works good just don't press finger super hard on camera. Or your reading won't be accurate. I use it to keep track of low blood pressure and has been working good. I know how my readings are and this is getting same readings. It shows my rate go up and down on my saves and that's accurate for my condition. Dr suggested I find an app.,5
10609,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"I have only used it a couple of times, but it seems to work great. I have even tested it against my pulseox and it was the same! On my phone when you open the app my flashlight comes on, it took me a few minute to figure out that was my flashlight and not where I needed to put my finger lol in my defense, my phone has three lenses, and since the flashlight came in automatically well! 🙃",5
10610,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Holy smokes! This app really works! I tested it against my blood pressure machine and both the pulse and blood pressure results were very similar. I ran the test 3 times and the 2nd run pulse rate came in pretty high. That's why I made sure of my finger placement and reran the test one more time. It came in very close to test 1. What can I say guys (& gals) this is an incredible app. Much thanks!,5
10611,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,I have POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia) and have been using this app the past few days to keep track of my BPM and its been fairly accurate and really helpful! It seems fairly accurate after comparing to the good ol' finger on pulse test. It's really easy to use and the ads are all easy to exit and relate to other heart and health related apps,5
10612,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"My doctor had recommended I use this app. I have graves disease so being able to easily check my heart rate is one way that can help me to be sure my thyroid medication is working. I love how it offers advice from professionals as well, it is really helpful to get a second opinion! The app is super through and easy to use and so far I haven't had an problems with it at all.",5
10613,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"I like it. Seems to work well with accurate reads. Gives results and the option to have the result explained further if you watch a short, simple video. Gives the average between what is normal, high, low for different age groups, etc. This app has the potential to really help.",5
10614,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"I am very happy with the convenience and overall access of this app. The activity- based-correlational options are really helpful, especially for those of us with many health issues. Also, unlike other apps, it takes less time to measure, which reduces the chance of uncomfortable heating in ones finger.",5
10615,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"I haven't fully utilize this I just downloaded the app. I can't even believe that they have stuff like this. It work I just have different reading. All options I've chosen were different, and they were close as to an average rate. But I will use this on my active to my non active to see what my average would be. Running vs resting on different level.",5
10616,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"This app is really good! If you're looking for something free then then is perfect it only has adds which aren't annoying at all. It also offers tips and other type of information which is really useful. Definitely something worth downloading, it's really great that it's free to use since anyone who may want to use it possibly won't have the money for it but there's no need to worry about that",5
10617,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"I find this is quick, easy to use and keeps a record for me. I read comments where people were having pro legs but I have had none and my pad and cell phone is an android but not an expensive one. You put your finger over the lens(most are on back) NOT on the picture on screen that states measuring now. I was thrown off for a moment. I was putting finger on screen that says measuring now. Mine works with flashlight on or off. Put finger on glass lens (on back)",5
10618,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Top-notch Blood Pressure Monitor Machine app! Seamless integration with my device, precise readings, and intuitive data visualization. It's like having a personal health companion in my pocket. 5 stars for helping me stay on top of my blood pressure!",5
10619,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"It's a great free app - sure there are some adverts but their not long. I do sometimes get a high reading which I know is incorrect, so do another test and it's normal - maybe needs looking at? However I've used a few of these and this is my favorite by far.",5
10620,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Very useful app. Accurate and interactive. However, ads could be put after measuring since this is a health app and people are using it sometimes for emergency.",5
10621,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"This is the best heart rate monitor app I've ever used. It actually measures and Checks your Pulse and heart rate, by, Placing your finger over your phone camera lens once your phone's flashlight comes on. It's an Awesome App! I highly recommend this app to anyone out there.",5
10622,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,This app gives you an insight of not just your heart rate but but stress levels and also advices how to calm your stress level down. I highly recommend it,5

10624,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"I have been using this app for nearly two years now, and I find it very useful. How accurate it is, it's still up for comparison with proper medical tools.",5
10625,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Didn't see an ad as stated. Was worried it would make me get a high rate cause how much that stuff pisses me off. But Google doesn't measure ; I'll assume it's cause I have motorola an that brand is almost worse than fake devices I bought in mexico. So I had to try this. Dunno how accurate it is yet but I'm probably 140-175 usually so I'll take 175 for now,5
10626,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Love this app. Just not sure how to sync data with primary doctors. Otherwise love how I can keep track of my health information. Thank you so much for having this on my app store.,5
10627,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Excellent detected that I was resting; watching t.v. excellent! I have a slight arrhythmia, so I can watch that too on screen.😍🥰",5
10628,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Went to a medical professional to see how accurate this app could be. Spot ON! Thank you programmers!,5
10629,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"I have multiple health issues, so I downloaded this app because I was able to store all my records in one place. So far, so good. I can't find anywhere to buy the app, should I decide to continue using it.",5
10630,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Excellent finally found afreat site thats works easy peasy set up no strings attached this is it. Thanks to alk the people that workedon this for us . Colleen myles,5
10631,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Very easy to use and seems to be very accurate when comparing to my Fitbit.,5

10633,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Heart rate monitor is accurate and legit! 👍 For me as of now this app helps me a lot to monitor may heart rate and pulse thanks for this app good job! 😊😊,5
10634,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Just installed and used, not sure about the results. How only putting finger on camera read the blood flow.",5
10635,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Does what it says on the tin, gives you the heart rate monitor as well as a tracker and loads of relevant information completely free, most apps of this type would make u pay for tracking and additional info, yes there's quite a few ads but it's not much of a problem as it isn't the kind of thing you spend lots of time on, closing one or two pop up ads on something you'd use once a day isn't a big deal, quality app, props for giving away something that obviously has time put into it for free.",5
10636,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Great app. I use it after I exercise and I record it in a notebook to check for any change.,5

10639,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Very accurate when it comes to heart beat. Used it many times to monitor hb. Very good overall,5
10640,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,It works. Nothing more or less they promise. Some ads but not overly annoying.,5
10641,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,It works for your beats per minute not a blood pressure thing at all just to check heart rate of how fast or slow your heart is pumping.,5
10642,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"It seems OK, works very well, but there is no way to check it unless in a doctors surgery.",5
10643,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Very useful and guidance to monitor my blood pressure daily, recommended",5

10646,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Great heart rate app. Easy to use and if you watch a video it unlocks more info.,5
10647,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Once I figured out where to put my finger it worked great. The trick is you will see your finger fully covering the little heart view finder on your screen when it is in the right place and it seems to help to use some pressure rather than just placing your finger in the right place. You can actually feel it as it beeps along with your heartbeat, it is pretty cool.",5
10648,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"My experience with this app has been very good. I find the measurements not to long to take, navigating through the app and it's tabs is very simple. There is opportunity for you to specify details about your readings and it also syncs with Google Fit. I would love to see the non-premium version offer Heart Rate Variability ♥ as well as a summary of what information about your health,energy,and stress levels have been derived from the reading. In summary, I really enjoy this app. It is useful",5
10649,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Well I have nursing experience and I've taken many vital signs of patience and I see that the heart rate monitor is very accurate. So give you five star rating thank you and I appreciate you very much stay healthy and God bless you all Amen 🙏❤️🙏,5
10650,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"I just recently got the heart rate app. I was impressed with everything about it. I do have a health issue, and being able to get an accurate heart rate count is important for relaying to my doctor. I was also impressed with all the different factors taken into account, not just age and sex, but activity level... exercising, sitting, standing, just so more. All saved and logged for my doctor to see. So easy to use and understand. I recommend this app to anyone who wants accuracy with ease.",5
10651,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Nice app and seems to run smooth so far I will definitely continue to try it and compare.,5

10653,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,This is the most amazing app so easy to setup. Extremely accurate and even the adds are not a problem. Excellent for medical information and so easy to follow.

10662,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Easy to use and very straightforward,5
10663,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Very useful app when feel that tension you can identify that bp is normal and no other side effects,5

10667,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Useful, help to check if things ok or not. I tried lot of apps before, but this is the only that works. Also the app don't risk your finger getting burned. So 5 stars. One little request, I'd like an EKG/Cardiograph Line would be helpful at results screen for watching ads for example, that would help see if there is irregular heartbeats, or if we stop one two beats with heart rate. Anyway, i found an app now to use regularly and keep my heart prblem checked on the go.",5
10668,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Very good app and is very accurate and helps with my anxiety,5
10669,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Works fine. Easy to get reading.,5
10670,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"So far pretty good, I've tried others but they expect money, this app doesn't or hasn't for me so far ☺️",5
10671,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Accurate and quick monitoring.,5
10672,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Love it so far. Will update when all is utilized more in depth 👍🏼 so far so good though... seems accurate 🤔🤷🏼🤓🤞🏼🙃🧑🏼‍⚕️🦵🏼💪🏼🍻👊🏼. Stay tuned y'all.....,5
10673,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Hate ads, always have always will. Thankfully it doesnt bother me too much on this app as they have no timer so thats a bonus. The app is quick and easy too use and you can loggin with your email with the tap of a button and save your ratings. Needed this as i find it hard too find my pulse outside of exercising, but this app was quick and easy for me too keep a record any time i needed it. Considering this is the first app i clicked on, i dont think i need too even bother looking elsewhere. 😊",5
10674,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Really good app easy to use,beautiful interface",5
10675,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,I love being able to check my BP anytime during the day. Very good app to install,5
10676,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,As people indicated there are ads. They vary in length but nnot too bad so far. Some videos don't cancel so watch or close and reopen the app. It's easy to use. Put your finger on the camera and it records it.,5
10677,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Awesome way to keep track of my heart rate while having the flu and upper respiratory illness. Would recommend to anyone needing to keep track of your health the easy convientiant way !!,5
10678,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,An absolute amazing app to use that would recommend to anyone to use download for free.,5
10679,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,I liked this app until the app changed my language or someone hacked into it. So I u installed the app and will find another one I am updating my review. I reinstalled your app and it's working great like it did in the beginning. It is a good app I can only say I don't know what happens before. I give you a 5 star rating and will let u know if there's any change down the road.,5
10680,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,not bad ads make it confusing at times,5
10681,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,So easy to use & seems quite accurate,5
10682,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Thank you for the application. Its easy and very useful. How to add free?,5
10683,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Excellent app looking good visually, easy to use, advertising isn't annoying, but ofcourse it would be better without adds. I don't know if there is full version available, but I would buy it if there would be one payment for have the app forever, I wouldn't pay the subscription for this app. ❤️",5
10684,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Seems to be pretty accurate to me and has some nice other features to where you can keep track of each time you measure your heart rate. Has some other features that I haven't looked through yet as I just started it. So far so good though for a free app. Think it might have other features you can pay for or unlock some how.,5
10685,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"This one is the best out of all of them, I have covid and thought my heart rate was irregular so I've tried a few different apps, some gave me very irregular results. This one keeps reminding me that my heart rate is just fine, between 70 and 90 in rest, and it beeps regularly too, gives you straight results afterwards, something that another app didn't which made me really anxious. Now I know I just have to take rest and my lightheadedness has nothing to do with my heart rate.",5
10686,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"I think it's always really close. I have a defibrillator/pacemaker and spend a lot of time in the hospital, and it's always with a few bpm off. Someone took my fitbit, so I use this to spot check my heart rate. Now I do know this if your heart goes into afib/vfib, the rate can be wrong. Your heart is not beating like it should at the time you're in fib. Even if you have,it's still good to check. I have vfib and when it starts to get high , sit down and take more meds. I'm not saying you should",5
10687,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Finding my into the app is straightforward enough. I winged it with the multiple lenses on the back until I found the correct one, which on a Pixel 7 Pro is correctly located furthest from the flashlight. With the sound volume already on I could both hear see my pulse being recorded. Oh and I stood, at ease, with my phone and elbows down and relaxed. Importantly this app works with the Google Fit App.",5
10688,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Amazing app. The adds are not bad at all. You get the odd advert that clicks off after about 5 seconds. Accurate reading and you can keep a record of your readings. It's brilliant. I wouldn't complain! Thank you for the free app!!! I love it x,5
10689,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Very convenient to do a quick check on heart rate. You can also keep record of blood sugar levels and body mass index so you have everything in one place. The developer appears ethical. I have seen few ads, but mostly petitions supporting good causes. Very good.",5
10690,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Not click bait for once! Wonderful job! Decently accurate, and it doesn't need sound, I was a little surprised when it asked me to turn on my camera, but it did show me what it was using it for.",5
10691,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"First time user, and I like what I saw! The setup was a little awkward but most of it is fairly intuitive. Yes, the ad was intrusive, but when are they not? and it was over quickly. I'm pleasantly surprised and impressed with the ap. Thanks!",5
10692,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Yay! Love this app. I deleted it. Waited to install again. Was great, 1st time worked same as now, then wouldn't measure. Only teaching info. Now app working as before! Had openheart CABG. NOW I can keep track especially at night. Keep phone close so don't have to move far. Helps with tachycardia also. Thank you ❤️ ❤️❤️",5
10693,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"Does what it says on the tin. I compared my first readings to my actual medical BP and heart rate checker and the readings did match bar a small difference. Its a clean simple to use app. My only vice is the add playing before I can even check my heart rate. Seems silly to do that when this is a serious medical app and not a game. I don't mind adds when the app is free. I just don't like that I can't instantly check my heart rate if I'm worried its high, without watching the add first.",5
10694,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Very happy with this app as it is accurate & extremely helpful,5
10695,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,My measurements were right on. This has been helpful. Great app,5
10696,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,This works and not full of ads,5
10697,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,At first I couldn't figure it out I did it 10 times and got eight different results but then I figured it out and you have to have your fingerprint Edition Just Right on the camera and the last three times I took it it was around the same reading very good app I definitely recommend it and there's only like one ad every time you open the app which ain't bad,5
10698,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,"I've developed heart issues, could have been there all this time. One thing about being able to get certain readings about my heart right from my cellphone is really good. Helps me with certain levels of anxiety. I love the app!",5
10699,heartratemonitor.heartrate.pulse.pulseapp,Functions as advertised. There is a single short ad every time you open the app which is minorly annoying but fine given the app is otherwise entirely free.,5

10800,com.google.android.apps.healthdata,"Apparently it won't even be visible to put on a home screen unless I put a screen lock on my device.. I don't want my device locked because given a choice between getting locked out of my own device that is never out of my possession, or having the APP that appears to be completely centered on help jocks keep score so they can brag, or having this otherwise useless app, I will do without the app.",1
10801,com.google.android.apps.healthdata,"Inconsistent performance. Yesterday my data synced without issue. Today, only half of my steps are syncing to other connected sources. Using Galaxy watch, googlefit reflects half as many steps. Workout data from Peloton shows things like 300,000 calorie burn for a walk. Right. I contacted support. They blamed everyone else for the data problem",1
10802,com.google.android.apps.healthdata,"Everytime I open Google Fit it pastes my step count into all of my other connected apps, which is not a problem because that's what I wanted to do. The PROBLEM is that it does it multiple times even after it's already done it, so now my Samsung Health and Withings app both think I've done 70,000 steps because I made mistake of switching back and forth three times when in actuality I've only done 20,415 steps.",1
10803,com.google.android.apps.healthdata,"First of all, I don't like that every time I want to access the app I have to search for it on the search bar to open it cause it has no homescreen icon. Secondly, It seems redundant. The only reason I have it is because it is the only way to connect with my Samsung health, which keeps better track of steps than Google fit. This makes me sad cause, other than the inaccurate step count, Google fit has a better system for adding information manually.",1
10804,com.google.android.apps.healthdata,I realize the app is still beta but it just doesn't work. I'm trying to sync my Fitbit Charge 5 and my Samsung Galaxy Gear watch with Google Fit and no data is ever transferred. I have all the app permissions set and I have the apps priority list correct but it just never works. I'm going back to using FitToFit (Fitbit to Google Fit) and Health Sync (Gear watch to Fitbit) which works perfectly. The only drawback is that Health Sync can't transfer heart rate to the Fitbit app.,1
10805,com.google.android.apps.healthdata,"The latest update seems to have broken everything. It was already a delicate balance where my Galaxy Watch data was going into Samsung Health, then Health Conect would transfer the data to Google Fit which would then feed into other apps (walk for rewards type programs). But nope, everything is broken now and it's infuriating. My Google fit will say I have 0 steps but 2 hours of active time. I don't know why some data is being ready but not other info. So frustrating.",1

It's a shame because I really like Google fit but here I am stuck with Samsung health.",1

I have been using the same fitbit account since the beginning of time, and I have not switched anything.

When I pull up the app, there is no information in it, or does it appear to even connect to anything. Yes, I updated the charge 5 firmware, and have the Fitbit app on the phone which works fine. I've tried for 2 hours to get anything to work but no luck. I can't seem to find any documentation on this whatsoever. So far for me, a total fail.",1
10809,com.google.android.apps.healthdata,"EDIT 20230331: latest update is draining battery like crazy. PREVIOUS: Without some sort of auto sync (like FitToFit does), this app is useless to me. For example, i have a nutrition tracker that offsets calories based on exercise from Google fit. My actual exercise comes in from Fitbit. However, since there is no auto sync for Health Connect, that nutrition app will never get the Fitbit data unless I manually open the Fit app first every time, which is very unpractical.",1
10810,com.google.android.apps.healthdata,I have a Samsung device and watch so I use this to try to transfer stuff over to Google fit. Doesn't work. Steps don't transfer over exercises don't transfer over so far it's literally useless (almost every two or three-star review says the exact same thing those should probably be one star reviews considering how the entire point of this app is to transfer data),1
10811,com.google.android.apps.healthdata,"Does not sync steps accurately. I will have a count on my watch and Samsung Health app and Google Fit will still show 0 steps. If I drill down into the source data, it shows the accurate count but this is only in the source data, not in the dashboard or on any reported metrics - all those still show zero. Disappointing, but I'll keep trying in the future as I know this is still sort of in a beta state. In the meantime, I'll go back to using Health Sync.",1

10813,com.google.android.apps.healthdata,Right now I have to give it a one because nothing syncs.

It seems to work better with Samsung, but I don't have a Samsung watch.

10819,com.google.android.apps.healthdata,"App requires screen locks to connect Fitbit to Google Fit, and it's not even visible on the home screen. The Google Fit syncing process takes a LONG time on Android 11 tablets: there's no way to trigger a sync manually, and the auto sync takes about 10 minutes. Once the data is finally in Google Fit, it doesn't even register in Pokémon Go's Adventure Sync. FitToFit is MUCH faster, but that app stopped working with Adventure Sync a long time ago",1

Would be nice to have a refresh on demand type button though since sometimes it lags behind by a few but it's great being able to review my data using both apps as they both have stengths and weaknesses about how the calculate and shot the data.,5
11208,com.google.android.apps.healthdata,Thanks for the such useful application. I need to merge my data from different services and that's really good this service exists,5
11209,com.google.android.apps.healthdata,Nice. No need to use 3rd party applications to sync data among the apps.,5
11210,com.google.android.apps.healthdata,"Absolutely brilliant to finally agregate data like this, it still has a long way to go but being able to cherry pick what app sends what and pulls what makes life so much easier.",5
11211,com.google.android.apps.healthdata,This app solves a very important interoperability / continuity problem for devices that produce health data. Look forward to seeing what post-beta looks like.,5
11212,com.google.android.apps.healthdata,"Loved it's interaction with so many things. BUT, it supported the Dexcom G6, and doesn't seem to support the G7.",5

11217,com.google.android.apps.healthdata,I've been struggling to synch my Zepp app with Google Fit for some time and this made it happen instantly 👍 Doesn't appear in my app drawer though so had to search for it through settings -apps so that I could recommend it,5
11218,com.google.android.apps.healthdata,"Health Connect is now live in Beta! Thank you to our early adopters for helping us test this product, the testing track is now closed. Try Health Connect (Beta) out with your compatible health and fitness apps.",5
11219,com.google.android.apps.healthdata,"This works really well, except it depends on the host app (Google Fit, Samsung Health, etc.) to read and write data to it.",5
11220,com.google.android.apps.healthdata,I wish this was my old Google health vault. I miss that so much 🥺,5
11221,com.google.android.apps.healthdata,"Although choices are limited as to WHAT can sync to Google Fit so far, this is working flawlessly to sync steps, move minutes, sleep, heartrate, and workouts from both a Pixel Watch (fitbit data) and Galaxy Watch 5 running on S23 Ultra. On pixel 6pro and 7pro fitbit data synced but did double the data once and awhile for steps - I did not put the galaxy watch on the pixels but will attempt that soon. I ran both watches at the same time and individually on the S23U. It didn't double the data.",5
11222,com.google.android.apps.healthdata,I like that it syncs with Fitbit and resmed,5

11225,com.google.android.apps.healthdata,"Love it. Sure there are some small bugs and there are some reading/writing discrepancies with some of the Integrations it seems like, but I love healthconnect and I'm glad that it could sync Fitbit and Google Fit. Logging is great, easy to read. I have zero complaints as this app replaced my fit2fit helper app for my Fitbit",5
11226,com.google.android.apps.healthdata,"I 100% Recommend This App to link All Your Apps that is Health-Related Because You Can Have all the tracking in One & Sync Accurately, it's simple to use, You Select your Primary Source for example mine is Samsung Health because everything is linked to Samsung Health then I got it connected to Health Connect which shares all the information to the Other apps So They Can linkup with Each Other. It's basically like health sync But Better. Although I do recommend syncing Health sync to this app too",5
11227,com.google.android.apps.healthdata,"Health Connect works just as it's supposed it. I use Health Connect to sync data between my two Withings products, the Body Cardio and Scanwatch and Google Fit. The syncing works seamlessly and accurately in both directions.",5

11229,com.google.android.apps.healthdata,I love the integration with using different fitness apps and wearable apps like Fitbit and Google Fit.,5
11230,com.google.android.apps.healthdata,"As long as my data and progress is kept private and not sold, I am fine with this app. 3PLUS HR+ is the watch I wear. I also swim and I do not get credit for that🥺. Apple Watch Ultra is pricey and does not say what the IP rating is. Fit tells me that though I am in bed for 8-9 hours, I only sleep 4.5-5 hours. How do they figure that? How is ot that my heart beats 52 beats per minute? I at least need an explanation if possible. I appreciate the attempts to help people guide themselves healthwise",5

11237,com.google.android.apps.healthdata,Very good product and very helpful.,5
11238,com.google.android.apps.healthdata,All data was transferred from Fitbit to G Fit quickly. I had to toggle/cycle the app on and off in both apps once in order for them to start syncing.,5
11239,com.google.android.apps.healthdata,"Fantastic feature. Especially since I have a Fitbit but prefer the UI of an app like Google Fit, having all the data synchronised is a blessing from Google.",5
11240,com.google.android.apps.healthdata,"Cool it seems to be working between Samsung health and Google fit. I am happy they made this initiative of health connect ❤️. It's just that Google fit is a bit too proud to read all the data from Samsung. And hence can't keep a good database. Which kind of makes it pointless because I wanted to keep my statistics on Google. But Google only syncs activity,sleep,vitals, nutrition and body measurements. Hourly graph cannot be made. if it's 240 steps it will show as 10 steps every hour for the day",5
11241,com.google.android.apps.healthdata,"So far so good! I've been syncing my Fitbit data to Google Fit with this, and it's been working great so far. Google Fit is much more user friendly in my opinion. I will update this review if I have any problems.",5

11250,com.google.android.apps.healthdata,Finally. This should have been Incorporated to Android from the beginning so that all Health apps did the right thing from the start instead of now trying to retrofit them into the system.,5

Also Spotify only works when the paired phone is nearby?!,2

App not re-syncing data to watch. Sync not bidirectional. 4. Modify watch settings from app. Features need to added: 1. Touch to wake up. 2. Access menu without button click.

And more control over how a session can be interpreted. 3. Better App to Device intergration. The band tells that 120bpm is resting even though it set at 100 resting in the app. (Plus why isnt 90 resting an option) 4. Battery Drain optimizations. And just a tad larger font size. Think there is a product worth having. Just the polish isnt there yet.,3

11817,com.oneplus.health.international,The app & watch needs a lot of improvements. And consideration this is more at a test phase (that's what it feels like) there should be a way to point out problems. Two big problems right now are 1) There is a presistant notification that says the watch is connected. Just takes up space and not really needed. Also the bluetooth icon also is always showing. For my other watch the icon doesn't show for the watch since in it always connected anyway. 2) Notification channels (only personal msgs),3

As a way to manage the watch it's ok but frankly the software needs some better functionality - quick way to mute sounds (ideally by matching sounds setting on your phone), notifications should be cleared if you've read them on your phone - rather than having to clear them both on the phone and watch. More watch faces - the options are fairly limited at the moment.",3

11821,com.oneplus.health.international,"I am using the oneplus band for the last 20 days. The rating here is based on the experience I have had with this combination. Setting up the band using the app was fairly straightforward so a 4.5 * for that. There are a few messages/tips that come up after setting up the app they are not really easy to note and I often missed them. For a first time user such notifications if prominently displayed could be very helpful. There is no automatic activity tracker that is slightly disappointing but I knew what I was getting into. Google fit is able to do the same without any device. GPS integration with the band seems very unpredictable. It works sometimes but not always. All the required permissions are given and double-checked. Battery optimisation is turned off too. The major disappointment is the integration with google fit. This app is blocked by google which means oneplus has not yet met the google requirements. I urge the developers to periodically provide updates and fix these issues. Sleep detection algorithm is completely off the mark, app detects awake time when I am not. Sleep statistics is not adequately descriptive. This requires major improvement. Some time stress section in the app gets displayed this indicates the app fails to recognise the device properly. Overall the app requires some more attention than Oneplus has devoted. Your app has to catch up with your device.",3
11822,com.oneplus.health.international,The Smart band App. I have purchased Oneplus SmartBand using this app for it. However the SmartBand is not as smart as expected. Rather all GPS tracking and for such multiple functions band is totally depend on the App. Further the app is not giving that much analysis as other App. Even if when I don't have Oneplus the free Google fit was giving me the same details. The plus side is it gives 99% accurate heartbeat rate and Oxygen level. For that can give 4 Star.,3

Also under records for workouts the longest record doesn't record properly, for example my longest walk is 1 hour 14 minutes, the record goes down as 114 minutes.",3

It's quite simple to use. I was going to give two stars, mainly because of the difficulty in linking to Google Fit. However I found a resolution for that on forums. I also would like to see more customization in terms of watchfaces, maybe allow images from the device and more flexibility on quick app shortcuts to be added. A ""Watchface Creator"" would be a cool thing to have in the app.",5

It's a simple fix though just go into ""settings-users & accounts"" then log out of your OnePlus account. Then after that hold on the app and select ""app info- storage usage"" and clear app data. After all that reopen the app and go through the process. Not sure why but this works. Gave this 5 only so it'll hopefully catch attention and help others.",5

12407,com.oneplus.health.international,"I don't know why everybody is hating on this app. I mean sure, compared to Google fit it's missing some features, but unlike Google fit it looks like the development team is actually trying to improve this app. Plus, when you pair it with the OnePlus watch it actually performs better than the Fossil Gen 6 running Wear OS2 (I'll update this review after Google releases OS3). A lot of the stability problems people are reporting here are actually the watch firmware, not the app.",5

I know I could have turned notifications off, but I did want reminders for my tasks. I should have been able to control the number of reminders. Also, it was pretty lame that I couldn't make multiple lists. I was just dissatisfied overall with my limited options.

I'll have a daily task, like reading, that can float through my day... often times I'll get it done in the might before I go to bed, other times it'll happen in the afternoon when I have free time. I can schedule my reading task daily, but if I complete the task at 12 AM on the night of November 1st, it counts as ""tomorrow"" and won't automatically reappear until November 3rd. I propose that Todoist have a night-owl setting, in which we late-nighters can define when our days end. I don't want my reading to count for November 2 if I'm completing the task for November 1 before I've gone to sleep. I don't want Todoist to skip that task to November 3 even if it is the next calendar day because I won't have done my reading for November 2.

I suggest allowing a ""pause"" feature for these types of situations where a disturbance is quite important. Now, I understand that people may take advantage of the pause feature, thus ruining the very purpose of the app. This is why I suggest a limited number of pauses, likely one or two allowed per day or per week.

My biggest complaint is the drawing feature on the ipad (which is the main thing that makes me a convert) is very buggy and the app crashes very often on the ipad. The drawing feature sometimes deletes randomly or moves things drawn to odd places. If those issues were fixed it would get 5 stars. Love the sticker feature. Would love a check mark sticker.

The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it does not seem to have a way to sync with a desktop or web application.   One thing that doesn't work well in my day to day life, in any to-do app, is more customizable sorting. Either it's too manual, making the todo app more of an interruption, or the sorting doesn't predict my priorities well. The simplest solution would be to combine basic sorting (priority, due date, category, etc) with manual sorting somehow. One way would be to have items initially sorted by your selected method. Then allow the user to manually sort any item. When a new item is placed in a list  the new item would be placed in order according to the those items that have not been manually sorted. If all items in the list have already been manually sorted then there are two approaches I can think of. Either have new items automatically be placed at the top or bottom in those cases, or even better the app could have hidden values for this. e.g. an item due 2/16 that's manually moved ahead of an item due 2/12 would be considered having a ""due date"" of 2/11 for sorting.",4,1,1.21,2018-10-15 13:17:20,"Hi Justin, thanks for your feedback.

Therefore they do not sync between devices. Lowered rating from 5 to 2 stars. I'm trying to respond to the Developer. Their comment doesn't show up in the edit pop up so I'm not sure where it will be when I submit this. I have been using Business Calendar since I got my original Droid about a decade ago. Once I decided that I liked the way that it worked, I paid for the pro upgrade. When Business Calendar 2 came out I installed it along side Business Calendar Pro to keep the pro features without an additional payment. I also installed both programs on an Android Tablet. Everything synced with Google Calendar and tasks showed up on both devices. The only issue was that if you entered a repeating task on one device and marked it complete on the other the repetitive task was not created. I realise that this is a Google problem, but you could probably pass this information in the description field if you wanted an enhancement. I recently got a new phone. That is when the tasks quit syncing. I think that a newer version of the apps were installed on the phone than I had been using. I also upgraded the apps on the tablet to see if that would fix the problem. I have just uninstalled the apps from both devices, deleted the tasks from Google Calendar in a web browser, and reinstalled the apps on both devices. I recreated several repeating tasks on the phone. They did not sync to Google Calendar.",2,5,2.41.0,2020-12-02 09:42:31,"Hi, your problem is caused by the sync limitation of the Google Tasks.

What would take it to 5 stars for me is the ability to choose which days are shrunk on the Week widget. Friday and Saturday are often my busiest days but they are the smallest windows on the widget.

The delete button is on the top right now (used to be on bottom of page), and the save is on the top left.
